              "'After reading the Life Magazine article \"They Decide Who Lives, Who Dies,\" what do you admire about the Seattle Artificial Kidney center\\'s approach to selecting patients for dialysis? What criticisms of the process do you have? Dialysis allocation in 1960s Seattle Left untreated, end-stage renal disease is uniformly fatal, usually within weeks. With dialysis treatments to clear uremic toxins from the blood, regulate electrolytes, and remove excess fluid, people with end-stage renal disease can live for years. When hemodialysis was first made available in the 1960s, there were many more patients who could potentially benefit from dialysis treatment than could be accommodated by the limited number of machines. The Seattle Artificial Kidney Center was faced with making the \"tragic choice\" of which patients would live and which would die. The first decision made by the Kidney Center physicians was to limit candidates to those who they thought were likely to successfully tolerate the treatment from a medical and technical perspective. This led them to restrict the candidates to otherwise healthy adults aged 18 to 45 years. In this way, they hoped to maximize the overall utility of the limited resource. That is, they aimed for hemodialysis slots to be allocated in a way that achieved the greatest total benefit for the population overall. Even after limiting the pool of candidates by medical criteria, there were 60 candidate patients competing for 12 dialysis spots. At this juncture, the medical team made an interesting and novel decision - they turned the selection process over to a group of community members appointed by the county Board of Health. Their intention was laudable; they aimed to let non- medical aspects of the decision-making process be guided by the values and preferences of the local community. The community committee was anonymous to protect members from external pressures and the Life Magazine article suggests that the members appeared to accept the responsibility for making life-and-death decisions with appropriate gravity and trepidation. The citizen committee considered a variety of strategies by which dialysis candidates could be selected. Ultimately they decided that because dialysis was a public resource, they should select patients who could \"give back\" to the community. With this goal in mind, the committee chose recipients based on their \"social value\" or social utility. They explicitly considered each candidate\\'s net worth, employment status, marital status, dependent children, religious affiliation, and educational attainment. Publication of Shana Alexander\\'s Life Magazine article \"They Decide Who Dies, Who Lives\" resulted in a national outcry and public revolt against the \"social value\" criteria being used for life-and-death decisions. As one critic stated, \"The Pacific Northwest is no place for a Henry David Thoreau with bad kidneys\" (UCLA Law Review 1968). The committee\\'s selection paradigm clearly advantaged certain groups of people who were already societally privileged. Some suggest that the skewed composition of the committee led to this biased result. While the kidney center intended to incorporate a spectrum of opinions, the citizen committee members only represented a narrow slice of 1962 Seattle: they were all white, six of seven were men, and most were socioeconomically advantaged professionals. It is perhaps unsurprising that selection criteria aligned with the personal values of this group. Further, any selection criteria that are intended to maximize utility may sacrifice equity; that is, equal treatment of persons regardless of background. Egalitarian ethicists call into question the very idea of selection based on \"social value\" by claiming all persons have inherent and indivisible worth. In the words of the Declaration of Independence: \"all men are created equal.\" Choosing candidates for medical treatment on the basis of their individual \"value\" is an affront to the inherent dignity of all persons. In Alexander\\'s Life Magazine article, the surgeon suggests an alternative selection strategy intended to maximize equity: a lottery (\"drawing lots\"). Would a lottery system have been preferable to the approach taken by the Committee? Would you suggest other strategies for selecting candidates? In contemplating these questions, you might consider what is the goal of the selection process: is it to maximize equity (fairness) or utility (good outcome, or benefit)? Contemporary kidney transplant allocation In response to the public scandal precipitated by dialysis rationing, the U.S.Congress passed an amendment to Medicare in 1972 that extended coverage for dialysis treatment to all U.S.citizens with end-stage renal disease, temporarily avoiding discussion about the ethically appropriate strategy for rationing healthcare. However, very similar dilemmas have re-surfaced as an increasing number of patients with end-stage renal disease seek kidney transplantation despite a relatively limited supply of donor kidneys. Though considered a miracle therapy in the 1960s, dialysis is difficult and burdensome for many patients. Most give up three days of every week to sit in an outpatient hemodialysis center while their blood is cleaned. It is also increasingly apparent that kidney function is complex (and fascinating! See renal course pack for more), and despite improvements over the last decades, dialysis does not come close to restoring full health. Kidney transplantation-the surgical placement of a kidney from a living or decease donor into a recipient with end-stage renal disease-is an alternate treatment for end-stage renal disease. Transplantation has been shown to improve both length and quality of life, and is the preferred treatment for many patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the supply of donor organs is not adequate to meet the demand. There are currently approximately 95,000 patients on a national list waiting to receive a deceased donor kidney transplant. However, there are only approximately 18,000 kidney transplants performed every year in the United States (6,000 from living donors and 12,000 from deceased donors). This gap between supply and demand for kidney transplant contributes to a wait time on the order of 3-5 years for deceased donor kidneys. Question 2: Today you are going to consider four candidates for kidney transplantation. Our medical center\\'s Multidisciplinary Selection Committee has evaluated their medical and surgical risk factors and confirmed that each candidate stands to personally benefit from kidney transplantation. Your job is to determine who should get the next kidney available from a deceased donor. Please review the four cases below. Donor details: The donor was a 35 year-old, 88-kg man with no known past medical history who died as a result of an intracranial hemorrhage following a motor vehicle accident. His creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL (normal) on the day he was declared dead by neurologic criteria (\"brain death\"). Our medical center is offered one kidney graft. We have no concerns about the kidney quality and expect that it could last more than 15 years. Of the four cases, which candidate should receive this kidney transplant? What is your justification for this decision? What factors do you think should and should not be considered? Can you identify whether these factors are based in principles of equity and/or utility? The four patients include a 39 year-old man with congenital kidney disease who has been on dialysis a long time, a 69 year-old man with diabetic kidney disease and history of stroke, a 25- year-old woman with anti-GBM disease, and a 49 year-old man with polycystic kidney disease who has not yet started dialysis. In the medical school ethics course, you will learn about strategies to resolve conflicts that arise when stakeholders (patients, providers, family members, others) disagree about what is important in the clinical care of an individual patient. However, in situations where a medical resource is scarce, the medical community needs a strategy for balancing conflicting values and needs of multiple patients and/or society as a whole. Selection criteria supporting Distributive Justice (the just allocation of a societal good or resource) can be grouped broadly by whether they aim to maximize utility and/or equity (or both). Importantly, there is no consensus on the right way to allocate health care resources, and reasonable people may disagree. The principle of utility suggests that we should act to maximize the overall good (or benefit) to society as a whole. (John Stuart Mill makes this argument in his book Utilitarianism.) In the case of transplantation, the goal may be to maximize the benefit that a donor kidney can impart overall to society. Of course, the interpretation of this rule depends upon how one defines benefit and who is considered the beneficiary. This criterion could be formulated to argue for multiple candidates. Mr D might be most strongly predicted to have a long-lasting kidney transplant. He is the only candidate not yet on dialysis (transplants done before initiation of dialysis (pre-emptive transplants) have the best outcomes in terms of transplant longevity) and his genetic disease cannot recur in the transplant kidney. He is at the lowest infection risk. As a population, younger patients (aged 15-29) have a lower average graft survival compared with middle-aged patients, possibly because of higher rates of medication nonadherence and potentially a more robust immune response. So, to avoid \"wasted\" kidney-years, Mr C might be the first choice. Mr B stands to benefit the most from the kidney transplantation immediately. He is \"the sickest\" of the four candidates because of his extensive cardiovascular disease, so he has the highest risk of short-term mortality on dialysis. Compared with the other candidates, transplantation would cause the greatest net improvement in his short-term life expectancy. In other words, he has the greatest \"immediate need.\" The limited ability to reliably predict future health, medication adherence, social support, etc might also argue for this choice. Notably, selection by \"immediate need\" produces the opposite priority list from the first selection criteria. This high-quality kidney has the potential to last for decades, so one might reasonably argue that it should be given to the recipient expected to live the longest. This would favor one of the younger and healthier recipients who may be more likely to use the kidney for as long as it is able to function (to squeeze out every last drop of urine, so to speak). (In the real kidney allocation system, this selection choice carries the added benefit of reducing the likelihood of a recipient needing repeat transplant, which puts additional strain on the limited pool of donor kidneys.) Should any consideration be given to life situation or life stage? Female reproductive health is compromised by ESRD treated with dialysis, while male reproductive function remains largely intact. Is it right to consider the unique burdens of end-stage renal disease as it affects Ms C\\'s ability to have children? Does she in fact \"need\" the kidney more than the others? The principle of equity requires us to treat all members of society similarly (for example, John Rawls equates justice with fairness). In health care, we might aim to provide everyone in need with 1) equal treatment (unfortunately not an option here because donor kidneys cannot be divided) or 2) equal opportunity for treatment. There are also different ways to prioritize recipients with a goal to support equity. Grafts can be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. In this system, whoever has been on the wait list longest (whoever got in line first) would get priority. A major concern with the first-come, first-served strategy is the people who are fastest to get on the waitlist will get priority, and this is rarely random. Ms C may have been socioeconomically advantaged compared to Mr A, in which case she had more ready access to a nephrologist, was more likely to be educated about transplantation, and was more quickly evaluated by the transplantation committee. On the other hand, Mr A has spent more time with end-stage renal disease, but perhaps because of social barriers, it took him longer to be listed. For this reason, it might be more fair to define wait-time by years on dialysis. Some ethicists (eg, Norman Daniels) suggest that a goal of health care should be to offer everyone in society an equal expectation for a \"normal lifespan.\" Advocates for \"fair innings\" would say that a younger patient should be offered a kidney to give them a similar opportunity to live a long life, while an older person has already had this experience. They argue that everyone should have the opportunity to experience major life events such as education, marriage, children, and profession. Mr B who is retired with grandchildren has had the opportunity for many more life opportunities than Ms C. Of course, you might also argue that the most \"equitable\" process would be to allocate kidneys by chance. We could just hold a lottery! The U.S.national kidney allocation system As it happens, all of these considerations (with the exception of reproductive potential and lottery), have been included in various iterations of the national kidney allocation system (organized by the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS)), and the current allocation scheme attempts to balance considerations of equity and utility (see Epilogue). Interestingly, most other solid organ transplants (lung, liver, heart) are allocated primarily based on \"immediate need\". That is, the sickest go first. The backbone of these allocation systems differs from the kidney allocation system in part because the immediate need is stark-organ failure can result in death within days rather than the years afforded by dialysis. The near- universal availability of dialysis as an alternative treatment for ESRD shapes the conversation about appropriate allocation criteria for kidney transplant. Stay tuned as other organ- replacement technologies, such as total artificial hearts, also become more widely available. There is general agreement that pediatric patients should receive priority over adults for kidney transplant. This stance is supported by the concept of \"fair innings\", which suggests that children should be afforded the opportunity to experience life events that older adults have already enjoyed. Others might argue that we have a special obligation to care for children because of their uniquely vulnerable status in society. With certain exceptions beyond the scope of this discussion, pediatric transplant centers generally have the first right of refusal for pediatric or young adult deceased donor kidneys. In contrast, older adults are less likely to receive kidney transplants. Many transplant centers are reluctant to propose an absolute upper limit on age for transplant recipients-and the Age Discrimination Act largely prohibits this practice-but age is often used as one marker among many for expected post-transplant longevity, which in turn factors into allocation decisions. Nonetheless, some see this practice as implicit age-discrimination. The explicit consideration of individual social value in the allocation of organs is largely considered unethical and excluded from formal allocation systems. However, social advantage, implicit bias, and healthcare disparity unfortunately still play an implicit role in kidney allocation (see Epilogue). Because unintended and unanticipated disparities can result from any allocation system, UNOS attempts to be transparent in its allocation algorithm, and publicly disseminates population-level real-time allocation reports so that practice can be analyzed, discussed, and adapted. What follows is an epilogue provided for those interested in reading about the real-world outcomes of the cases discussed in class and the existing kidney allocation system. The following material will not be tested. The cases were real patients with minor details edited for clarity and confidentiality. Happily, all four of these individuals were transplanted over the course of three weeks in 2015. These cases offer striking real-world examples of the considerations involved in kidney transplant allocation. Until December 2014, priority for kidney transplant was determined primarily by time on the wait list. Kidney transplant centers are able to add patients to the wait list once their eGFR falls below 20 ml/min/1.73m2. After an extensive period of study, public comment, and predictive modeling, a new system was implemented on December 4, 2014. The new Kidney Allocation System (KAS) sought to address several specific concerns related to equity and utility of the existing system. One of the most fundamental modifications to the allocation system was a change in how wait time was calculated. Rather than calculating wait time from initial listing, wait time is now calculated from the date of the first dialysis treatment or the date of initial listing, whichever came first. A primary motivation for this adjustment was recognition of socioeconomic inequality in access to transplant. Before a patient can be waitlisted for kidney transplant, they must see a nephrologist, be referred to a transplant center, complete an extensive medical and psychosocial evaluation, and have adequate financial and social support. In the previous 4.3 years of wait time 2.5 years of wait time 1.0 years of wait time 0.2 years of wait time system, those most likely to be waitlist and begin to accrue time early in their disease course were patients who had the most ready access to the medical system. This is seen clearly by comparing Mr A and Mr D.Mr A had a congenital urologic defect that was not picked up until his kidneys had already failed, which may be related to a lack of primary care. On the other hand, Mr D was referred to nephrology by his primary care physician early in his disease course. Once he was on dialysis and in the United States, Mr A was referred for transplant. However, he lived three-hours away from the University of Washington. Distance from a transplant center can present a major barrier for patients who live in rural areas, particularly in the WWAMI region. There are no kidney transplant centers in Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, or Idaho. Patients who live in these states must travel to Seattle, Spokane, Portland, Salt Lake, Denver, or Bismarck for transplantation. Dialysis patients in, say, Great Falls or Billings may have reservations about engaging in the transplant process simply due to the burden of travel. Once Mr A was referred to a transplant center, he faced additional barriers. He lacked medical insurance for several years, so was not considered to be a transplant candidate. Having adequate medical insurance to pay for post-transplant medications is critical-if a patient is unable to regularly take their maintenance immunosuppression medication, they may have an immune response against their kidney graft (\"rejection\") which can result in transplant kidney failure and other serious medical complications. Although he was eventually able to move forward with the support of Washington State Medicaid, there were serial delays in completion of the required workup (stress test, echocardiogram, etc.) due to difficulties contacting the patient and his limited ability to travel to appointments. His medical evaluation took over a year to complete. Finally, transplant centers require their patients to have adequate social support. A family member or friend must be willing and able to assist 24-7 in the months after transplant. Mr D had a clearly-defined and enthusiastic social support person (his wife). Mr A did not, but eventually he was able to work out a plan to stay with a friend in Seattle and have his sister come in from out of the area as well. For all of these reasons, allocation based primarily on how quickly a patient can be waitlisted disadvantages those who are already socioeconomically disadvantaged. Under the new KAS, patients still have to complete the extensive medical and psychosocial evaluation process, but when listed, they receive wait time credit for the years they have been on dialysis. The new KAS incorporates one other major change with the goal of improving the utility of kidney allocation. Kidneys from younger, healthier donors tend to last longer than kidneys from older donors or donors with certain medical diseases likely to impact kidney function. If one aims to optimize the match between expected longevity of recipient and donor kidney, the best quality kidneys should go to recipients who are expected to otherwise live the longest. This strategy is called \"longevity matching.\" Donor kidneys are assigned a quality score (the Kidney 14.5 years dialysis time 4.3 years of wait time 3.8 years of dialysis time 1.0 years of dialysis time Mr D - 31% Ms C - 3% Mr B - 87% (3.8 years dialysis time) EPTS 3% 14.5 years dialysis time 4.3 years of wait time 1.0 years of dialysis time Donor Profile Index or KDPI) based on several donor characteristics (e.g., age, height, weight, creatinine, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, stroke, etc.). Those kidneys scoring in the top 20% are reserved for the 20% of recipients who have the longest expected post- transplant survival (EPTS). This metric is predominantly based on age, but also includes previous transplant, years on dialysis, and presence of diabetes. The Estimated Post Transplant Survival scores for our patients (lower percent = longer expected survival): Mr A - 21% This means that compared to all kidney transplant recipients, Ms C is in the top 3% of predicted post-transplant longevity, while Mr B is in the bottom 14%. Among our four candidates, the only one who would receive priority for a top 20%-quality kidney is Ms C, due to her young age, lack of diabetes or previous transplant, and relatively short time on dialysis. The new system also sets aside the lowest quality 15% of kidneys in a separate allocation pool These are kidneys from donors who were older and/or had more comorbidities are more likely to have some kidney scarring (glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis). While still expected to provide years of life free from dialysis, these kidneys do not last as long on average compared with \"standard\" donor kidneys. The median graft survival for a KDPI 86-100 kidney is about seven years. However, because there is less demand for these high-KDPI kidneys, the wait time can be much shorter. Individual patients are involved in weighing the risks and benefits of accepting a high-KDPI kidney. This is where Mr B comes in. Most of the candidates were better served waiting for a standard kidney that would live with them for longer. For Mr B, the tradeoff was worth it. Given his multiple medical comorbidities, he had a high risk of dying before receiving a transplant if he continued to wait. For him, the priority was to get off dialysis as fast as possible so he could better enjoy his retirement, rather than spend 3-4 more years waiting on dialysis for a standard- quality kidney. As it happened, Mr B accepted a kidney with a KDPI of 92%-that is, the kidney ranked in the bottom 9% of predicted post-transplant graft survival. However, he was able to receive transplant after being on dialysis for only one year. A 57 year old man presents to his physician with ankle edema which has worsened over the last 3 months. He has gained 22lbs in weight, but denies orthopnea or shortness of breath. No known liver disease. Examination reveals healthy looking male, pulse 78, BP 142/86, apyrexic. He has 3+ peripheral edema without jugular venous distension. Chest and heart exam are normal. No rash. Abdomen exam normal. Labs: Creatinine 1.2mg/dl; Serum albumin 2.2g/dl Urine: sediment - No red cells, rare granular casts, oval fat bodies - 24hr urine protein 8.6g/24h 1. What are the characteristic features of nephrotic syndrome? The 5 classical features of nephrotic syndrome are: proteinuria > 3.5g/24; hypoalbuminemia, edema, hyperlipidemia and lipiduria (oval fat bodies). 2. What complications of nephrotic syndrome might he develop? Hyperlipidemia can accelerate atherosclerosis. Thrombosis leads to hypercoagulability from increased hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors (eg fibrinogen) and loss of regulatory factors (anti-thrombin III, protein C and protein S) in the urine (often exacerbated by diuretics). Infection can cause an increased susceptibility to infection (especially by gram positive bacteria) caused by urinary losses of IgG and complement, but also by impaired cellular immunity. 3. What is the differential diagnosis for nephrotic syndrome? Renal Disease, Systemic Disease, Nephrotic Syndrome, Minimal Change Disease, Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Membranous Nephropathy, Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and Amyloid. 4. A renal biopsy is performed which reveals membranous nephropathy. What other testing would you like to do? It is important to differentiate between primary membranous nephropathy (due to an autoantibody to a podocyte antigen, anti PLA2R) and secondary forms of MN. Secondary causes include infection (esp. hepatitis B); autoimmune disease (esp. lupus), cancer (solid organ) and drugs (gold, penicillamine). In a 57yo man, he has a 20% of having an underlying tumor and needs to be worked up for this (age appropriate screening: full exam, CXR, PSA, colonoscopy) Case 2 A 66 year-old woman presents to her physician with 2 month history of generalized weakness, myalgia and skin rash. When her labs are checked she has an elevated creatinine 3.4mg/dl. Exam reveals a thin woman who is comfortable at rest. P 98/min, BP 156/72, apyrexic. She has no edema, but has a petechial rash over her lower extremities. Chest few basal crackles, heart normal. No jugular venous distension. Abd no organomegaly. Labs: Na 141; K 5.1; HCO3 19 Creatinine 3.4mg/dl (known to be normal 3 months previously) CBC: WCC 8.2; Hb 8.9g/dl (low); platelets 490k (high) Urine: UA 3+ blood, 2+ protein. Sediment shows multiple red blood cells, some dysmorphic, 2-3 red cells casts. Urine protein / creatinine ratio 1.6g/g 1. Is this a nephritis or a nephrotic syndrome presentation? This woman has features of nephritis (raised creatinine, hematuria with dysmorphic RBC and RBC casts, hypertension). Notably the fast climb in her creatinine fits the sub- category of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN). 2. What additional lab testing would you order? The differential diagnosis for RPGN is given in this table Important blood tests include ANCA - anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen, anti-GBM titer (for anti-GBM disease), ANA (for lupus) and complement C3, C4 levels as markers for lupus / cryos / MPGN.The clinical presentation of RPGN with systemic features and petechial rash is suggestive of an ANCA associated small vessel vasculitis. Other features that may be found include pulmonary vasculitis (may cause hemoptysis), nasal congestion/sinusitis, scleritis, deafness, mononeuritis multiplex. Antibody Mediated Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture\\'s syndrome) ANCA-associated SVV: GPA (Wegener\\'s), MPA (Microscopic polyangiitis), Lupus nephritis, Post infectious glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, MPGN, Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Hypersensitivity vasculitis (drugs), ANCA-negative, SVV polyangiitis and EGPA (Churg-Strauss syndrome). What would the renal biopsy be expected to show? In ANCA associated SVV the characteristic features on biopsy are glomerular crescents (layers of cells and fibrin in Bowman\\'s space) and glomerular necrosis. The term pauci- immune refers to the paucity of immune complexes seen on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. 4. What therapy would be indicated for this condition? ANCA associated diseases require urgent therapy consisting of immunosuppression. Specific medications include high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide or Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting B- cells. A 14 year old teenager presents with fatigue and bilateral wrist pain to her physician. She has previously been well. She is noted to have 3+ blood and 2+ protein on urinalysis and is referred to the friendly nephrologist. Exam reveals a healthy looking teenager with an erythematous rash over her cheeks. Joints exam normal. Chest, heart and abd normal. She has 2+ edema. Labs: Creatinine 1.4mg/dl; serum albumin 3.3 g/dl (lowish) CBC: WBC 2.8 (low); Hb 9.1g/dl (low); platelets 180k Urine: sediment - multiple dysmorphic rbc with occasional RBC cast. Urine protein / creatinine 4.2g/g 1. What systemic disorder might this teenager have? What are typical features of this condition? The combination of fatigue, arthralgia, malar rash, cytopenias and renal involvement in a young woman is highly suggestive of lupus. Other features of lupus include alopecia, mouth ulcers, serositis, photosensitivity and neurological features (psychosis, seizures). Kidney involvement (lupus nephritis) is very common ranging from mild asymptomatic hematuria to nephrotic syndrome (lupus membranous) to AKI from a proliferative glomerulonephritis. 2. Which blood tests would you check to confirm your diagnosis? Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) with double stranded DNA antibody (anti-dsDNA) is the diagnostic test for lupus. Supplementary testing might include complement C3, C4 levels and ESR (as markers of activity) and anti-phospholipid antibody panel (for an associated APLA syndrome) 3. How is this condition usually treated? Lupus is treated with immunosuppression. When the kidney is involved, stronger immunosuppression is required with steroids +/- mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. A 72 year old man has a past history of type 2 diabetes for 25 years, hypertension and coronary artery disease (angioplasty 3 years previously). He is noted to have a slowly rising creatinine over the last 2 years, currently 1.8mg/dl, and is referred to nephrology. His medications include lisinopril (ACE inhibitor), aspirin, simvastatin, and insulin. He feels well other than some pain in his left lower leg when he walks further than two blocks which is relieved by rest. Exam reveals pulse 88/min, BP 152/56, apyrexic. Eye exam reveals no retinopathy. Chest and heart exam normal. He has a quiet left carotid bruit and diminished peripheral pulses. Labs: 42 139 5.2 1.8 Glucose 152 mg/dl Urine: UA trace blood, trace protein, sediment exam benign. 24h urine protein 0.4g/24h 104 22 1. What features of this case are atypical for diabetic kidney disease? The minimal proteinuria does not suggest glomerular disease. The lack of retinopathy, and the long duration of DM2 without already developing DKD are also points against. 2. What are the more likely causes for this man\\'s CKD? The history of CAD, and the exam and symptoms suggest peripheral arterial disease (PAD). These disorders make it quite likely he has vascular disease elsewhere (note carotid bruit), and he is likely to have atherosclerotic renovascular disease. As an older male, it is also important to exclude urinary tract obstruction (prostate). Another possibility may be hypertensive nephrosclerosis depending on his BP control over the years. Myeloma less likely with minimal proteinuria, but we always consider this is older patients presenting with kidney disease. 3. Explain the increased pulse pressure for this man. With stiffening of the aorta with aging and atherosclerosis, there is less buffering of the systolic pressure wave (higher systolic pressure) and less elastic recoil (lower diastolic pressure) 4. How would you investigate this patient? A kidney Uss will exclude urinary tract obstruction. The Uss may show unequal sized kidneys (normally 11-12cm) suggestive of unilateral renal artery disease (the kidney shrinks with ischemia and CKD). To study the renal arteries a renal duplex (Doppler) may be performed. Stenotic areas in the renal blood vessels will lead to jets of blood flow with increased velocity. If intervention (angioplasty, bypass surgery) is being considered (uncontrollable HTN, worsening renal function, recurrent pulmonary edema), a renal angiogram is performed. Note the majority of patients with atherosclerotic renovascular disease do not experience a benefit of angioplasty over medical therapy (BP control, ACE inhibitor, statin for cholesterol lowering). A 29 year-old man presents with new onset of severe pedal edema. He has a history of IV drug use. He has had symptoms over the last few months of chronic fatigue, intermittent diarrhea, and oral candida infection (ie thrush). Exam: P62, BP 140/90, JVP not raised. He has ascites and 4+ edema. Labs: Creatinine 2.2; BUN 40; serum albumin 1.7 Urine - sediment occasional RBC, hyaline and granular casts with oval fat bodies 24hr urine protein 28g 1. Does the patient have a clinical syndrome suggestive of acute nephritis or nephrotic syndrome? How do you distinguish between the two? The patient has a clinical syndrome suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. Heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and lipiduria (oval fat bodies) are all present. The urinary sediment does not contain cellular elements suggesting a nephritic process, eg RBC casts or dysmorphic RBCs. 2. What additional history would you like to obtain? Is there a history of hepatitis C or HIV risk factors? Any recent infections, history of skin infections / abscesses. A thorough review of any medications (including herbs and over the counter medications) should also be obtained, as well as a complete review of systems (to assess for evidence of systemic disease). IV heroin users on the West Coast of the US (black tar heroin) are at risk of destroying their venous access, and may resort to IM (muscling) or subq (skin popping) their drugs. Recurrent skin and muscle abscesses may result from this. AA amyloid is a known complication of this chronic inflammation, and kidney deposition can result in nephrotic syndrome. 3. Are there serological tests you would like to order? Serologic tests which should be measured include anti-nuclear antibody (lupus) paraprotein workup for myeloma (serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains), virology (HIV antibody, HCV antibody, ANA, Hepatitis B Ag), RPR (syphilis), HbA1c (diabetes) and serum complement levels. These will help determine whether the following systemic diseases are causing the nephrotic syndrome: hepatitis C, B, HIV, lupus nephritis, syphilis, diabetes, or multiple myeloma. If there is a history of past malarial infection or recent possible exposure to malaria in endemic areas then this should also be tested. 4. Full serological evaluation is reportedly negative except for a positive HIV.What would be the most likely finding on renal biopsy? Renal biopsy may show a form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) known as HIV associated nephropathy (HIVAN) on light microscopy. This collapsing variant of FSGS represents a podocyte injury which results in collapse of the glomerular capillary and obliteration of the capillary lumen (sclerosis). It is unknown how HIV causes this lesion but it may be due to direct effects of the virus on renal epithelial cells. Notably, this lesion is almost exclusive to Black patients with HIV, largely due to the presence of the APOL1 high risk genotype. White patients with HIV and glomerular disease more commonly have an immune complex glomerulonephritis. 5. What is the long term prognosis? When HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) first became apparent in the 1980s, patient outcomes were terrible. The average patient was on dialysis within 3 months after diagnosis of HIVAN, and half the patients who started dialysis were dead within three months. In light of the poor prognosis, dialysis was not even offered to many patients. The development of effective antiretroviral medications has dramatically improved the long term prognosis of patients with HIV.Patients with kidney failure and controlled HIV infection may now undergo kidney transplantation. Case 6 An 8 year old girl was admitted for evaluation and treatment of gross hematuria. Approximately 14 days before admission she developed a severe pharyngitis which was not treated. Eight days later facial swelling and dark urine were noted. Her urinary output decreased, and peripheral edema appeared while the facial swelling became more marked. Physical examination revealed an edematous girl. BP was 140/90, pulse 120 and regular, respirations 20/min. Facial edema and 4+ peripheral edema were present. Laboratory data included a hematocrit of 34%, WBC of 10,000. Creatinine 0.9mg/dl, Serum albumin 3.3mg/dl. Urinalysis revealed 3+ albumin, 1- WBC/hpf, many RBC\\'s and RBC casts. 1. Does the patient have a clinical syndrome suggestive of acute nephritis or nephrotic syndrome? Although in children the most common glomerular lesion is minimal change disease (nephrotic syndrome), if we look at this case, the features are more in keeping with nephritis (hematuria, hypertension, raised creatinine). Note a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl is too high for a young child with small muscle mass. 2. What is the most likely clinical diagnosis? The most likely diagnosis is post infectious glomerulonephritis. This has occurred 2 weeks after a severe pharyngitis. 3. Is there additional serologic information you would like to obtain? Serum complement levels are typically reduced (low C3, CH50) and markers for recent Strep infection may be present (ASOT, streptozyme). Rarely lupus or vasculitis present in children and ANA and ANCA would also be checked. 4. A renal biopsy was performed which showed a proliferative glomerulonephritis with sub-epithelial humps on electron microscopy consistent with PIGN.What is the long-term prognosis? Although symptoms may be marked, the usual course is to resolution without treatment. Adults may have a more aggressive form of PIGN with crescents that may require immunosuppression. A large number of exam questions in our course require you to work through a clinical vignette. This is a very similar style to what you will see on your USMLE Step 1 as well as various end-of-rotation exams in the Patient Care Phase of the curriculum and other standardized tests you will take throughout your medical career. Sometimes the subsequent question will ask for you to make the correct diagnosis. More often than not, however, the question will require you to figure out the most likely diagnosis and then ask you a second-level question based on the diagnosis. These can include questions about underlying pathophysiology, the next most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis, the proper treatment etc. These vignettes can be challenging for students at an early stage of their training as it involves sorting through a lot of information in relatively short order. Below are some tips for approaching questions based on such vignettes. Most vignettes start with a short statement with some patient identifiers and the primary issue (e.g., a 54 year-old woman presents with shortness of breath). You should look at this primary complaint and start to develop a list of possible causes in your mind (i.e., the differential diagnosis). Pay attention to the duration of symptoms as that will affect the differential. For example, if a patient presents with dyspnea on exertion over a 3 month period, you are dealing with one set of problems such as chronic heart failure, COPD, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary vascular disease, anemia, whereas if a patient presents with dyspnea over 2 hours, you would be considering other items such as heart failure exacerbation, acute coronary syndrome, COPD or asthma exacerbation, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pneumothorax. Similar to what you will do in your clinical work, you will then use the other information that follows such as the review of systems, past medical, family or social history, exam and labs, to help you sort through that differential quickly. In general, with well-written questions, information is provided in the vignette for a reason... to make something on the differential more or less likely. Good questions do not typically contain fluff that is there simply to occupy your time. The information is there because it\\'s useful. For example, if a patient presents with dyspnea on exertion and the stem is telling you they are a long-term smoker, that increases the odds they could have COPD or an ischemic cardiomyopathy. If they had presented with leg pain with ambulation, the fact that they smoke would markedly increase the odds they have peripheral arterial disease. If they were a non-smoker, you would be considering alternative explanations. Be careful not to anchor on a single item. As you are trying to figure out the diagnosis, go with what the preponderance of evidence tells you is going on. Just because a person is a smoker, don\\'t lock onto that fact and conclude that their acute dyspnea has to be due to a COPD exacerbation when all of the other information in the case (risk factors, exam, imaging, labs) is telling you they are having a pulmonary embolism. The information in a vignette can seem overwhelming at times. One tip that some people find helpful is to glance at the question before they dive into the vignette. This can sometimes help you determine what it is you need to tease out of all of the clinical information in order to answer the question. Pulmonary Function Testing Practice Case Vignettes These cases have been created to help you build your pulmonary function test interpretation skills, which will help you sort through clinical cases in this class, on your USMLE exam and during your training that follows. Each case describes a patient with an unknown underlying disease. The cases will require integration of pulmonary function tests with the other data provided to generate an appropriate differential diagnosis. Each case includes the clinical history, and pulmonary function test results, including spirometry with flow-volume loops, lung volumes and diffusion capacity measurements. In some cases, other pulmonary function tests or additional diagnostic studies, such as chest radiographs, may also be included. Each case is followed by questions regarding test interpretation, possible diagnoses, and potential management options. On the page following each case, you will find a detailed test interpretation and answers to the associated questions. More detailed information about pulmonary function testing can be found in Chapter 7 of the CPR syllabus. Glossary of Terms Definition Forced Vital Capacity: the total volume exhaled during a forced exhalation maneuver. Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1): the volume exhaled in the first second of forced exhalation. FEV1/FVC The ratio of FEV1 to FVC, expressed either as a percentage (e.g., 78%) or a Term FVC FEV1 TLC RV FRC DLCO MIP MEP decimal (e.g., 0.78). Total Lung Capacity: the maximum lung volume to which an individual can inhale. Residual Volume: the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. Functional Residual Capacity: the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of a tidal exhalation; this is the point at which the tendency of the lungs to recoil to a lower volume is balanced by the tendency of the chest to recoil out to a higher volume. Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide: provides information about the surface area available for gas exchange. Maximum inspiratory pressure: the maximum inspiratory pressure generated by a patient breathing against a blocked mouthpiece when starting at residual volume. Maximum expiratory pressure: the maximum expiratory pressure generated by a patient breathing against a blocked mouthpiece when starting at total lung capacity.\\nA 62 year-old woman with Ebstein\\'s Anomaly (a congenital cardiac abnormality marked by displacement of the tricuspid valve towards the apex of the heart) presents for pulmonary function testing as a part of routine monitoring for pulmonary toxicity secondary to one of her medications, amiodarone. She currently has no respiratory complaints and does not have symptoms of heart failure. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FEV1 and FVC are both normal, as well as the FEV1/FVC ratio. Thus, spirometry is normal. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lungs Volumes: TLC, RV and FRC are all normal, indicating normal lung volumes. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is normal, indicating normal diffusing capacity and, therefore, a normal surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: The flow-volume loop is normal in appearance, as demonstrated by the fact that her loop falls along the predicted values, denoted by the black circles. This is expected given the normal pulmonary function testing. Interpretation: Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and normal diffusing capacity. These pulmonary function tests are normal. Certain medications cause pulmonary toxicity, such as pulmonary fibrosis, pleural effusions or other abnormalities. Early evidence for some pulmonary toxicity can be detected on pulmonary function testing, and patients on these medications undergo regular screening with PFTs. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication commonly used to manage atrial fibrillation as well as a variety of other arrhythmias. It is known to cause both acute and chronic forms of pulmonary toxicity. The North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology recommends obtaining baseline pulmonary function testing for patients on long-term amiodarone therapy and recommends follow-up testing if there are symptoms of pulmonary toxicity or if there is a change in the patient\\'s chest radiograph. A 68 year-old man presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion and chronic productive cough over a period of 2 years. He has a 52-pack-year history of smoking but quit smoking 14 years ago. What disease process could account for these results? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: While the FEV1 and FVC are reduced, the FEV1 is disproportionately reduced compared to the FVC, resulting in the low FEV1/FVC ratio. Because the FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.70, the patient is deemed to have airflow obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: Neither the FVC nor FEV1 improve by 200 mL and 12% after bronchodilator administration. Thus, there is no bronchodilator response. Lung Volumes: The TLC is normal indicating that the patient has neither restriction nor hyperinflation. The RV is elevated, indicating the presence of air trapping. Diffusion Capacity: The DLCO is reduced, indicating an impairment in diffusion capacity. This reflects a reduced surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: The flow-volume loop shows the characteristic changes of severe airflow obstruction. The airflow rates are reduced below the predicted values (as indicated by the black circles) and the expiratory limb (on the positive \"y-axis\") has a \"scooped out\" appearance typical of obstruction. Interpretation: There is airflow obstruction with a reduced diffusion capacity but without a significant bronchodilator response or air trapping. Airflow obstruction without a bronchodilator response is sometimes referred to as a \"fixed\" obstruction. What disease process could account for these results? The findings in this case are most consistent with COPD: The patient has chronic respiratory symptoms. The patient has an important risk factor, his smoking history. There is airflow obstruction as evidenced by the low FEV1/FVC ratio The low DLCO indicates that there has been a loss of surface area for gas exchange. This finding suggests that this patient\\'s airflow obstruction is the result of emphysema. Asthma also causes airflow obstruction, but you would not expect a decreased DLCO in this circumstance because the alveolar spaces, and therefore the surface area for gas exchange, are unaffected in that disease process. Similarly, people with history of smoking can have airflow obstruction due to chronic bronchitis. If there is no accompanying emphysema and therefore, the surface area for gas exchange is normal, this can manifest as airflow obstruction with a normal diffusing capacity. More commonly, patients with COPD have a combination of emphysema and chronic bronchitis.\\nA 73 year-old woman presents with a daily cough productive of white-yellow sputum for the last several years. She is a current smoker with a 35-pack-year history of tobacco use. In addition to the pulmonary function tests shown below, she underwent a chest radiograph which was interpreted as normal. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? What disease processes could account for these results? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FVC and FEV1 are normal. The FEV1/FVC ratio is < 0.7, indicating the presence of airflow obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: Neither the FVC nor FEV1 improve by 200 mL and 12% after bronchodilator administration. Thus, there is no bronchodilator response. Lung Volumes: The TLC, RV, and FRC are all normal, indicating normal lung volumes. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is normal, indicating normal diffusing capacity and, therefore, a normal surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: The airflow rates are reduced below the predicted values throughout exhalation and the expiratory limb has a \"scooped out\" appearance typical of obstruction. Interpretation: There is airflow obstruction with normal lung volumes and normal diffusion capacity. There is no bronchodilator response. What disease processes could account for these results? This patient\\'s pulmonary function tests reveal fixed (i.e., no response to bronchodilators) obstruction with normal lung volumes and normal diffusing capacity. Given the patient\\'s history including several years of smoking tobacco in conjunction with a daily, productive cough present for several years, chronic bronchitis is the most likely diagnosis. Note that the normal diffusion capacity, indicative of a normal surface area for gas exchange, makes emphysema less likely as the cause of airflow obstruction in this case. Several other airway-based diseases can lead to airflow obstruction on pulmonary function tests, including asthma and bronchiectasis. There are several features of this case that argue against a diagnosis of asthma. The patient\\'s symptoms are not typical of asthma, which more commonly presents with episodic worsening of symptoms depending on environmental exposures and other factors. In addition, the hallmark of asthma is reversible airflow obstruction, which often manifests on pulmonary function testing as a response to bronchodilators. This was not present in this case. Be aware, however, that if a patient\\'s asthma is not active at the time of evaluation, they may not have a bronchodilator response and may even have normal pulmonary function testing at that time. Bronchiectasis is an obstructive disease characterized by abnormal, permanent dilation of the airways due to impaired airway clearance and superimposed inflammation and infection. This is a consideration given this history and pattern of fixed obstruction on pulmonary function tests, though the cough in bronchiectasis is typically characterized by increased sputum volume, purulence, and tenacity. More information on obstructive lung disorders can be found in Chapter 10 of the Pulmonary Syllabus for CPR. A 32 year-old man presents for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion. He has a 12-pack-year history of smoking and quit four years prior to his presentation. He has a long-standing history of allergic rhinitis, and notes he is more dyspneic during the spring time and when grasses are growing. During these times he reports that he must stop to catch his breath at the halfway point when ambulating from the parking lot at his work to his office. With this, he also notes audible wheezing and has an occasional cough. His BMI is 47 kg/m2. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? What disease process could account for these results? Spirometry: The FVC is normal and the FEV1 is reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is < 0.70, indicating the presence of airflow obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: The FEV1 improves by ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL after bronchodilator administration, indicating the presence of a bronchodilator response. While the FVC does not improve by ≥ 12%, a bronchodilator response is defined by sufficient improvement in either the FVC or FEV1. Lung Volumes: The TLC is normal, so there is no restriction. The RV is normal, indicating no evidence of air trapping. The FRC is reduced. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is normal, indicating normal diffusing capacity and, therefore, a normal surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: The airflow rates throughout exhalation are reduced below the predicted values. Interpretation: There is airflow obstruction with a bronchodilator response, normal lung volumes and normal diffusion capacity What disease process could account for these results? Given the presence of reversible airflow obstruction and the fact that this patient\\'s symptoms appear to worsen in response to environmental triggers, the most likely explanation for this patient\\'s presentation is asthma. Characteristically, the airflow obstruction in asthma is episodic, triggered by environmental and other factors (e.g., allergens, dander, fumes, etc.), and relieved by bronchodilators. It can be difficult to distinguish asthma from other respiratory diseases as the symptoms of asthma are nonspecific, and there is no definitive test for making the diagnosis. As noted in Case 3, if a patient with asthma is asymptomatic at the time of pulmonary function testing, they may not show airflow obstruction or a bronchodilator response at that particular time. The clinical history, therefore, becomes critical for making the diagnosis and deciding on appropriate therapy. If you were to retest them when they were more symptomatic, the PFTs might show the more characteristic findings of asthma. The isolated reduction in FRC detected on lung volume measurements can occur in the setting of obesity due to extrinsic compression of the thoracic cavity by adipose tissue in the chest wall and abdominal cavity; the excess soft tissue changes the balance of recoil forces between the lung and chest wall such that FRC (the volume at the end of normal tidal exhalation) is lower than normal.\\nA 54 year-old man presents for evaluation of severe dyspnea. Two years prior he was hospitalized for septic shock due to pneumonia and subsequently developed the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He required tracheotomy and mechanical ventilation for nearly five weeks. He has since been liberated from the ventilator and decannulated (i.e., his tracheotomy tube has been removed). While in his rehabilitation program, however, he has noted worsening dyspnea on exertion over the past one to two weeks. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FVC and FEV1 are reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is < 0.70, indicating the presence of airflow obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lung Volumes: The TLC, RV, and FRC are all normal, indicating normal lung volumes. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is normal, indicating normal diffusing capacity and, therefore, a normal surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: Airflow rates are reduced below the predicted values. In addition, the expiratory limb of the flow-volume loop appears flattened, or \"cut-off.\" The inspiratory limb also shows lower inspiratory flows than seen with the earlier pulmonary function testing. Interpretation: There is airflow obstruction present with normal lung volumes and normal diffusion capacity. The flow-volume loop demonstrates a pattern consistent with a variable intrathoracic airway obstruction. What disease process could account for these results? The key to interpretation of the lung function tests is recognition not only of the airflow obstruction but also the fact that the patient has an abnormal flow-volume loop. The latter finding strongly suggests that the airflow obstruction is not due to a disease affecting the more distal airways, such as asthma or COPD, and, instead, is likely related to some form of upper (i.e., proximal or large) airway obstruction. Upper airway obstruction produces relatively predictable abnormalities of the flow-volume loop depending on whether the obstruction is located within or outside the thoracic cavity, and whether the obstruction is fixed (meaning the degree of airway obstruction does not change with airway pressure changes during the respiratory cycle) or variable (meaning the degree of obstruction changes based on airway pressure changes during the respiratory cycle). In this case, the expiratory flow rates are diminished and the expiratory limb has a flattened appearance. This is particularly apparent when compared to the flow-volume loop from one year prior. Flattening of the expiratory limb provides a clue that there may be an obstruction to airflow in the trachea or large central airways. In this case, the flow-volume loop raises the possibility of a variable intrathoracic obstruction. See the figure below for more information. In this case, the patient\\'s history of prior tracheotomy puts him a risk of developing scar tissue within the trachea that can lead to airflow obstruction. This is commonly referred to as \"tracheal stenosis.\" It is not necessary to know this particular diagnosis for the course, but rather to understand the flow-volume loop abnormalities that can be seen in upper airway obstruction.\\nA 60 year-old man presents for evaluation of chronic cough associated with dyspnea on exertion. The cough has been present for 2 years, is non-productive, present throughout the day, and awakens him from sleep. He has a 45-pack-year smoking history and is currently smoking one-half pack of cigarettes per day. He was prescribed an albuterol inhaler but has not noticed any difference in his symptoms when he uses it. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? What disease process could account for these results? What would be the next most appropriate test to order for this patient? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FVC and FEV1 are both reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normal; thus, there is no airflow obstruction. These findings are suggestive of restriction, but this can only be confirmed by examining the lung volume measurements. Bronchodilator Response: Neither the FVC nor FEV1 improve by 200 mL and 12% after bronchodilator administration. Thus, there is no significant bronchodilator response. Lung Volumes: The TLC is reduced, confirming the presence of restriction. The RV is low- normal and the FRC is reduced, which suggest that the restriction is due to an intraparenchymal process. Diffusion Capacity: The DLCO is reduced, indicating impairment in diffusion capacity and loss of surface area for gas exchange. This also suggests that the restriction is due to an intraparenchymal process. Flow-Volume Loop: The flow-volume loop shows characteristic changes of severe restriction. Note that there is decreased movement along the x-axis (i.e., the volume axis), consistent with the reduced vital capacity. The flow rates on exhalation are also reduced. This is because the patient is unable to inhale a large volume with each breath. Less volume in on inhalation means less volume out on exhalation. Less volume out per unit time yields lower flow rates. Interpretation: There is restriction with a reduced diffusion capacity and FRC, suggesting an intraparenchymal cause of restriction. There is no airflow obstruction. What disease process could account for these results? There are many diseases processes that can lead to restriction on pulmonary function testing, although the very low DLCO and the low-normal RV in this case are highly suggestive of a parenchymal cause of restriction. Of the parenchymal causes of a restrictive pattern, a diffuse parenchymal lung disease, such as pulmonary fibrosis, would be most likely in this patient. The fact he does not experience improvement with albuterol is not surprising, as the patient does not have airflow obstruction. What would be the next most appropriate test to order for this patient? When patients present with chronic respiratory symptoms and are found to have a restrictive defect related to an intraparenchymal process, the next most appropriate step is to order chest imaging. The patient would first undergo a plain chest radiograph and would, in all likelihood then be referred for a high resolution CT scan of the chest.\\nA 79 year-old man presents with dyspnea on exertion. He has a history of severe kyphoscoliosis and post-polio syndrome. He is being seen in follow-up with his pulmonologist with whom he undergoes serial monitoring of his pulmonary function. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? What do the lung volume measurements tell you about the cause of this patient\\'s primary physiologic defect? What do the low MIP and MEP tell you about his ventilatory defect? What aspects of the patient\\'s history likely account for the findings observed on these pulmonary function tests? Bonus question: What additional testing would you perform on this patient in clinic? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FVC and FEV1 are both reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normal; thus, there is no airflow obstruction. These findings are suggestive of restriction, which we can confirm by examining the lung volume measurements. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lung Volumes: The TLC is reduced, confirming the presence of a restrictive process. The RV is elevated and the FRC is normal, both of which suggest an extraparenchymal cause of restriction. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is within the normal range, indicating a normal diffusing capacity and, therefore, a normal surface area for gas exchange. In conjunction with a reduced TLC, this is consistent with an extraparenchymal restrictive process. Maximum Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures: Both the Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP) are reduced, suggesting neuromuscular weakness. The flow-volume loop reveals classic findings of restriction. At first glance the shape appears unremarkable; However, a closer look reveals the abnormality. Note that the predicted FVC is 3.86L. On the loop, we see that the exhaled volume, as shown by the movement on the x-axis is only 1.4L. In fact the dots for the predicted values are not shown in this particular flow volume loop because the are at far greater values on each axis than what this patient achieved during the testing. This provides a sense of the substantial nature of restriction in this case. Interpretation: There is restriction present with an elevated residual volume and normal diffusion capacity. MIP and MEP are also reduced suggesting neuromuscular weakness. What do the lung volume measurements tell you about the cause of this patient\\'s primary physiologic defect? This patient exhibits severe restrictive disease, which can be the result of either a parenchymal lung disease or a process extrinsic to the lung itself. The lung volume measurements can often provide clues to whether restriction is intraparenchymal or extraparenchymal. Note that his FRC is normal, which tells us that the balance of recoil forces between the lungs and chest wall is normal. When restriction is due to a parenchymal process, the increased elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma often results in a lower FRC.Another clue in his lung volume measurements is the elevated RV.Recall that the internal intercostals and abdominal muscles (including the rectus abdominus, internal and external obliques, and transversus abdominus) are used during forced exhalation. Because his neuromuscular disease affects these muscles, he is unable to forcefully exhale down to the predicted RV.In intraparenchymal restriction, RV is often reduced due to the increased elasticity of fibrotic lung parenchyma holding airways open (i.e., increased radial traction), allowing more air to escape during forced exhalation. The pattern of lung volumes observed here is quite classic for extraparenchymal restrictive disease, which in this case is due to a combination of chest wall rigidity and neuromuscular weakness.\\nIn addition to the lung volume measurements, his diffusing capacity is within the normal range, demonstrating that the surface area for gas exchange and the underlying lung parenchyma is likely normal. This serves as added confirmation that the bulk of his restrictive disease is due to processes extrinsic to the lung itself (ie extraparenchymal restriction). What do the low MIP and MEP tell you about his ventilatory defect? As mentioned above, this patient has restrictive lung disease due to an extraparenchymal process. In addition to the observed lung volumes, he also exhibits weakness in the muscles of respiration, reflected in the low MIP and MEP.It is also notable that the MEP is more severely affected than the MIP, suggesting his expiratory muscles (eg internal intercostals & abdominal muscles) are impacted to a greater degree than his inspiratory muscles (primarily the diaphragm but also the external intercostals). This suggests that his diaphragm may be less impaired than his abdominal and internal intercostal muscles. What aspects of the patient\\'s history likely account for the findings observed on these pulmonary function tests? As outlined in the case history provided, this patient has a known neuromuscular disease, post- polio syndrome. Polio is a disease that has been eradicated from the developed world thanks to successful immunization efforts, but individuals who were afflicted with polio earlier in life may continue to exhibit variable degrees of muscle weakness. Some patients who do suffer from poliomyelitis go on to develop what is referred to as Post-polio syndrome, a syndrome marked by development of neuromuscular weakness after a prolonged period of stability. This may impact the respiratory muscles of the abdomen, chest wall, and diaphragm. Presentations vary, but the patient in this case clearly demonstrates substantial weakness of his respiratory muscles. In addition to his post-polio syndrome, he has known severe kyphoscoliosis. When severe, this results in restrictive ventilatory defects due to rigidity of the chest wall and subsequent limitations in the ability to increase the volume of the thorax on inhalation. His chest radiograph below graphically demonstrates the severity of his chest wall and spine abnormalities.\\nWhat additional testing would you perform on this patient in clinic? Patients with neuromuscular disease are at a substantially increased risk of alveolar hypoventilation resulting in chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. This patient should undergo screening to ascertain whether he exhibits hypoventilation and requires assisted ventilation. While an arterial blood gas is the gold standard for measuring the PaCO2 and determining if hypoventilation is present, this can be painful for patients and is not always easy to obtain. As an alternative, we can estimate the PaCO2 in in clinic by measuring the pressure of carbon dioxide expired at the mouth, known as end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2). This is a surrogate measure of the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide which, as indicated earlier in the course, usually approximates the arterial value.\\nA 54 year-old man presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion. One year ago, he could walk one mile to the store without dyspnea and now he must stop and rest after walking 20 feet due to dyspnea, leg weakness and palpitations. He notes difficulty sleeping due to dyspnea in the supine position, and now sleeps sitting up in a chair. He has no cough but notes intermittent difficulty swallowing, causing him to choke on food. He has never smoked. What disease process could account for these results? What is the significance of the change in spirometry when testing is repeated in the supine position? What disease does this patient likely have? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: In the upright position, the FVC and FEV1 are both reduced, but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. Thus, there is no airflow obstruction. These findings are suggestive of restriction, which we confirm by examining the lung volume measurements. In the supine position, both the FVC and FEV1 are more than 30% lower than the values obtained in the upright position. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lung Volumes: The TLC is reduced, confirming the presence of restriction. The RV and FRC are normal. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO testing was not performed. Maximum Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures: Both the Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP) and Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP) are reduced, suggesting neuromuscular weakness. Flow-Volume Loop: The flow-volume loop reveals classic findings of restriction with reduced lung volumes on the x-axis and reduced airflow rates on the y-axis compared to the predicted values. Interpretation: There is restriction with normal RV.MIP and MEP are also reduced, suggesting neuromuscular weakness. What disease process could account for these results? This patient has a restrictive pattern abnormality, as indicated by the low TLC. The DLCO is often helpful in determining the cause of restriction. For parenchymal causes of restriction, the DLCO is typically reduced; whereas for extraparenchymal causes the DLCO can be normal. It was not measured in this case. Other information, however, can be used to determine the etiology. As discussed in the case above, intraparenchymal restriction often produces a reduced RV due to the increased elasticity of fibrotic lung parenchyma tethering the airways open and allowing more air to escape during forced exhalation. This patient\\'s RV is preserved. The MIP and MEP are both reduced, confirming neuromuscular weakness as the source of the patient\\'s restriction. What is the significance of the change in spirometry when testing is repeated in the supine position? Worsening spirometry in the supine position compared to the upright position also suggest the presence of neuromuscular weakness, specifically diaphragmatic weakness. Supine spirometry is not routinely performed during pulmonary function testing but can be requested if diaphragmatic weakness is suspected clinically. When upright during inspiration, the abdominal contents move downward away from the diaphragm due to the effects of gravity. This facilitates downward movement of the diaphragm on inhalation. When the individual is supine however, the abdominal contents remain higher up in the abdomen, often pressing against the diaphragm. A normally functioning diaphragm can easily contract against and move these abdominal contents out of the way; however, if the diaphragm is weak, it cannot contract efficiently and, as a result, cannot push the abdominal contents out of the way and move into the abdomen. This problem can be detected during spirometry; if both the FVC and FEV1 decrease by more than 20% compared to the upright position, the patient likely has diaphragmatic weakness. Due to the alterations in mechanics and decline pulmonary function in the supine position, many patients with diaphragmatic weakness complain of orthopnea (i.e., dyspnea that is worse in the supine position). While most commonly associated in patients with left heart failure, this important symptom can also be seen in patients with diaphragmatic weakness, severe asthma and morbid obesity. What disease does this patient likely have? The patient has evidence of weakness in multiple muscle groups including those of the head and neck (called \"bulbar\" muscles), legs, and respiratory muscles suggesting a systemic disorder. In this case, the patient was eventually diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\\nA 50 year-old man presents to his primary care provider with a chronic cough and progressive dyspnea. Three years ago, he was able to run 5-10 kilometers in organized recreational runs. He has never smoked tobacco. His review of systems is notable for blurry vision, erythematous tender nodules on the anterior tibial surface of his lower extremities, palpitations, and fatigue. What disease processes could account for these results? What disease does this patient likely have? How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? Spirometry: The FVC and FEV1 are both reduced with an FEV1/FVC < 0.70, confirming the presence of obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lung Volumes: The TLC is reduced, which indicates the patient also has a restrictive process. The RV is also reduced, suggesting that the restriction is due to a parenchymal restrictive disease. Diffusion Capacity: DLCO is reduced, indicating a reduced diffusing capacity and, therefore, a reduced surface area for gas exchange. This further suggests the presence of a pulmonary parenchymal process as the cause of restriction. Interpretation: There is combined obstruction and restriction with a reduced diffusion capacity. This is referred to as a mixed obstructive-restrictive process. What disease processes could account for these results? The list of single disease processes that can cause a mixed pattern of obstruction and restriction on pulmonary function testing is relatively short. The disease most commonly cited is sarcoidosis, but other possible causes include pneumoconiosis, such as silicosis or berylliosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, cystic fibrosis and other rare forms of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Mixed obstruction and restriction can also be caused by the presence of multiple diseases at the same time. For example, a patient may have an obstructive lung disease, such as COPD or asthma in addition to an extrapulmonary restrictive process such as neuromuscular weakness. Occasionally we see patients with both COPD and diffuse parenchymal lung disease as a cause of mixed obstruction and restriction. Thus, mixed pattern pulmonary function tests often represent the complex interplay between multiple processes that affect respiratory mechanics. What disease does this patient likely have? The patient in the stem above most likely has sarcoidosis based on the history of respiratory, skin, ocular, and possible cardiac symptoms in conjunction with a mixed pattern of restriction and obstruction on pulmonary function tests. In addition, the chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral hilar opacities. These could represent either hilar lymph nodes or enlarged pulmonary arteries. In a patient with suspected sarcoidosis, they are more likely to be enlarged hilar lymph nodes, a radiographic finding commonly seen in this disease. This can be confirmed, if necessary, by ordering a CT scan of the chest, which better delineates between lymph nodes and pulmonary vasculature. This patient ultimately underwent a lung biopsy which demonstrated non-caseating granulomas, the histologic hallmark of sarcoidosis.\\nA 70 year-old man presents with dyspnea on exertion that has worsened over a 10-year period. He has a 38-pack-year history of tobacco use but quit smoking approximately 15 years ago. His BMI is 28. How would you interpret these pulmonary function tests? What disease process could account for these results? What is the significance of adjusting the DLCO for hemoglobin in patients with anemia, as in this case? After reviewing the pulmonary function tests in conjunction with the chest radiograph, what is the next most appropriate test to order for this patient? Spirometry: The FVC, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC ratio are all normal. There is no airflow obstruction. Bronchodilator Response: Not performed. Lung Volumes: The TLC is normal. There is no restriction. The RV is normal. The FRC is slightly elevated. Diffusion Capacity: The DLCO is reduced, indicating a reduced diffusion capacity and decreased surface area for gas exchange. Flow-Volume Loop: The flow-volume loop is virtually normal, with airflow rates and volumes close to the predicted values. Interpretation: Normal spirometry and lung volumes with a decreased diffusion capacity. What disease process could account for these results? This patient has an isolated, significant reduction in the diffusion capacity, indicating there is a marked abnormality in the alveolar-capillary interface for gas exchange. The pattern of an isolated impairment in diffusion capacity can be seen with anemia, early diffuse parenchymal lung disease, and pulmonary vascular diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension. What is the significance of adjusting the DLCO for hemoglobin in patients with anemia, as in this case? As described in chapter 7 of the CPR syllabus, DLCO is measured by having the patient exhale completely to residual capacity, followed by inhaling a maximal breath to total lung capacity breathing gas containing trace amounts of carbon monoxide (CO). CO is used for this test due to its high affinity for hemoglobin, which produces a large gradient for diffusion from the alveolus into the blood. Once at TLC, the patient is instructed to hold their breath for 10 seconds, allowing the inhaled amount of CO to diffuse across the alveolar-capillary membrane, be taken up by red blood cells, and bound to hemoglobin molecules. Once the 10 second breath hold is complete, the patient exhales quickly and completely and the exhaled gas is collected after discarding the initial portion that represented the anatomic dead space (the goal being to collect the gas that represents the alveolar compartment). The difference in concentration of carbon monoxide between exhaled and inhaled gas is then used to determine how much CO diffused into the blood. In patients with anemia, defined by a low hemoglobin, less CO is taken up by the blood during this maneuver as the amount of hemoglobin in the blood is reduced. A correction factor must then be used to compensate for this and is reported as the adjusted DLCO.In this case the adjusted value, while higher than the uncorrected value, is still abnormally low, meaning that this truly represents a decreased surface area for gas exchange. In other cases where DLCO is reduced, correcting for hemoglobin may produce a value that returns to the normal range. This would indicate a normal surface area for gas exchange, and in such a case the reduction in uncorrected DLCO can be attributed to the anemia. After reviewing the pulmonary function tests in conjunction with the chest radiograph, what is the next most appropriate test to order for this patient? The chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral hilar opacities. These could represent either hilar lymph nodes or enlarged pulmonary arteries. The pulmonary function test results suggest these could be enlarged pulmonary arteries, a radiographic finding that can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension. When concern is raised for pulmonary hypertension, the most appropriate next test to order is an echocardiogram. While right heart catheterization is the gold standard for measuring pulmonary artery pressure, it is more invasive and resource intensive than echocardiography which is the more appropriate initial step. An echocardiogram was performed to evaluate for pulmonary hypertension and revealed an estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressures of 70 - 80 mm Hg (normal is up to 30 mm Hg).\\nTwo of the primary roles of the respiratory system are moving oxygen into the body and eliminating carbon dioxide. These gases are moved through a series of branching air passages to and from the alveoli, the key site of gas exchange. This chapter examines the macro- and microscopic structure of the airways and alveoli and the functional implications of the structural characteristics. At the end of this chapter you should be able to. Compare the structure and function of the conducting and respiratory zones of the respiratory tract. Describe the changes in the structural organization of the airways as you move from the proximal to the distal airways. Describe the function of airway cartilage and the ciliated respiratory. Describe the pathway of an oxygen molecule from the alveolus to the red epithelium blood cell. Explain the functional relevance of the ultra-thin alveolar-capillary barrier. The upper respiratory passages (nasal cavities and nasopharynx) conduct the air and warm and moisten it on the way to the lungs. These passages are also involved in olfaction and conduct and shape the sounds that produce speech. The larynx opens off the lowest part of the pharynx. During swallowing, it is closed off from the pharynx above and the esophagus posteriorly by the epiglottis. The trachea begins at the lower border of the cricoid cartilage of the larynx, at the level of the 6th cervical vertebra. It passes from the neck into the mediastinum of the thorax, where it lies just anterior to the esophagus and ends by dividing into the right and left main bronchi below the level of the sternal angle, between T5 and T6 in the standing individual. This first bifurcation is called the main carina. Note the vertical orientation of the right main bronchus relative to the left main bronchus. The aortic arch passes superior to the left main bronchus, in contact with the anterior and left lateral aspects of the lower trachea. After bifurcation at the main carina, the right main bronchus extends only 2-3 cm before giving off the right upper lobe bronchus, then continues as the bronchus intermedius which divides into the right middle lobe and right lower lobe bronchi. The left main bronchus leaves the trachea at a greater angle than the right and extends about 6 cm to cross over the left atrium. At the hilum of the left lung it divides into left upper lobe and left lower lobe bronchi. Because the right main bronchus is more directly aligned with the trachea it is more likely than the left to receive material aspirated into the airways or be entered by a deeply inserted endotracheal tube (mainstem intubation). Mainstem intubation can also easily occlude the right upper lobe bronchus because the right upper lobe orifice is located so close to the main carina. When an endotracheal tube (ET) is inserted too deeply, it is likely to go beyond the trachea (T) and down the right main bronchus (RMB) where it can easily occlude the take-off to the right upper lobe (RUL). The lobar bronchi divide in a series of asymmetric bi- and trifurcations into segmental and subsegmental bronchi. These airways divide several more times, leading eventually to the terminal and respiratory bronchioles which eventually give off the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli where gas exchange takes place. General Structural Principles There are several important general principles regarding airway structure. Changes in Airway Diameter and Cross-sectional Area Whenever an airway branches into smaller segments, it is said to give off another \"generation\" of airways. Although the diameter and cross-sectional area of any individual airway decreases with each successive generation, beyond about the 10th generation of airways, there is a huge increase in the total number of airways such that the total cross-sectional area for airflow increases markedly. This is especially true in the bronchioles where the daughters of each division are only slightly smaller than the parent airways. The total cross sectional area of the airways increases from ~ 2.5 cm2 in the trachea to over 100 cm2 at the level of the terminal bronchioles. As a result of the large increase in cross-sectional area, the small airways make little contribution to total airway resistance despite their very small radii. This is significant from a clinical standpoint, as diseases affecting the very peripheral airways can be functionally \"silent\" until they reach an advanced state and affect large numbers of these airways. Conducting and Respiratory Zones The airways and airspaces are divided into two distinct zones. The conducting zone, extending from the larynx through to the end of the terminal bronchioles, transports and conditions air and regulates airflow for the purpose of phonation. Notably, there are no alveoli and no gas exchange in this area. All gas exchange takes place in the respiratory zone, which extends from the respiratory bronchioles through the alveolar ducts and sacs to the alveoli. At the level of the mainstem bronchi, the airways travel and bifurcate in tandem with vessels from the pulmonary circulation within what is called the bronchovascular bundle. The picture depicts a cast of the airways and blood vessels. The airways are white and the pulmonary arterial vessels are red (although they carry deoxygenated blood). Note how they move in close proximity to each other and branch together. The pulmonary veins travel separately. This bundle also contains lymphatic vessels. This pattern helps the lungs achieve a key principle of efficient gas exchange - matching of air and blood flow at the alveolar level. This principle is referred to as ventilation-perfusion matching. Specific Airway Structures Each component of the airways has specific structural elements with functional significance. Nasal Cavities and Nasopharynx The nasal cavities and nasopharynx are the portal of entry and exit for the respiratory system. These passages consist of narrow, twisting channels that increase the surface area and, thereby, warm and humidify the inspired air and prevent foreign invaders from accessing the lower respiratory tract. The bulk of these passages are lined by a ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar epithelium, more commonly referred to as a respiratory epithelium. Beneath the epithelial surface in many areas are complex loops of capillaries that carry blood in the opposite direction as airflow, helping to warm and humidify the air through a countercurrent exchange mechanism. The roof of the nasal cavities and the superior conchae are lined by a specialized olfactory epithelium, a highly cellular ciliated pseudostratified epithelium that contains several structures important for olfactory function, including bipolar olfactory neurons that detect odorants and can regenerate if damaged and Bowman\\'s glands that produce secretions that dissolve the odorant and protect the neurons. There are differences between this thicker, more complex epithelium and its submucosal structures and the thinner more standard respiratory epithelium. The various cartilaginous structures comprising the larynx (arytenoid, cricoid and thyroid cartilages) are manipulated by skeletal muscle to assist with phonation. The epiglottis projects from the upper margin of the larynx and prevents aspiration of food, fluid or oral secretions into the respiratory tract. The epiglottis is covered by stratified squamous epithelium on its upper surface, which transitions to ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with serous and mucous glands on its inferior surface. At the bottom margin of the larynx are the false (vestibular) cords and true (vocal) cords. The immobile false cords are covered by respiratory epithelium while the mobile true cords are covered by squamous epithelium and contain both elastic connective tissue (vocal ligament) and striated muscle (vocalis muscle) important for sound production. The trachea is lined by a ciliated, pseudostratified columnar epithelium (i.e., respiratory epithelium) beneath which lie submucosal glands that produce a watery mucous.\\nOn the anterior two-thirds of the trachea along its entire length, the submucosa contains C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage that are critical for maintaining airway patency. Without these rings, high extraluminal/intrathoracic pressure with increased expiratory effort (eg exercise) would collapse the airway and impede expiratory flow. The posterior third of the trachea contains smooth muscle (trachealis muscle) which contracts during cough to narrow the tracheal lumen and facilitate expectoration. It relaxes during swallowing to ease passage of food through the esophagus. Bronchi As one moves more distally through several generations of bronchi to the smaller bronchioles, several structural changes occur. The ciliated respiratory epithelium decreases in height and complexity while the number of goblet cells and glands decreases in number, becoming rare by the small bronchi. The amount of cartilage decreases as the distinct rings surrounding nearly the entire airway in the mainstem bronchi give way to isolated small plates of hyaline cartilage. Finally, the amount of elastic fibers and smooth muscle increases significantly. Elastic fibers help maintain airway patency while smooth muscle is a key site of pathology in asthma and a target for medications used to treat the disease (bronchodilators, Chapters 9 and 10). Bronchioles The bronchioles are also lined by respiratory epithelium and contain large amounts of elastic fibers and smooth muscle but lack cartilage and glands. Within the terminal bronchioles (Figure 1-8), the epithelium transitions from a simple columnar epithelium to a cuboidal structure. Figure 1-8: Terminal and Respiratory Bronchioles. The terminal bronchioles have a simple epithelium (E) and smooth muscle (SM) but lack glands and goblet cells. Alveoli (A) come off the walls of the respiratory bronchioles but are not seen in the terminal bronchioles. Smooth muscle in the bronchioles plays a role in regulating the distribution of ventilation.\\nThese bronchioles also contain Clara Cells, which produce surfactant and play a role in airway defenses. The respiratory bronchioles have similar structural features as the terminal bronchioles with one important exception - the presence of alveoli within their walls. Thus, the movement from the terminal to the respiratory bronchioles marks the transition between the conducting and respiratory zones of the lung and entrance into the region where gas exchange occurs. Alveolar Ducts and Alveolar Sacs After several generations, the respiratory bronchioles divide into alveolar ducts, which lack a ciliated respiratory epithelium and are completely lined by alveoli covered by a thin squamous epithelium. The alveolar ducts subsequently terminate in clusters of alveoli referred to as alveolar sacs. The relationships between the bronchioles, alveolar sacs and ducts and alveoli can be appreciated from figures. The lamina propria is very thin in this region, containing small bands of smooth muscle (Figure 1-9 inset) whose contraction regulates the distribution of airflow and elastic fibers and collagen that provide structural support to the airways and alveoli. Figure 1-9: The Distal Airspaces. The figure depicts multiple distal airway types including terminal bronchioles (TB, note the absence of alveoli coming off the walls), respiratory bronchioles (RB), alveolar ducts (AD) and sacs (AS) and alveoli. The inset shows the knobs of smooth muscle seen in the lamina propria of the alveolar ducts which regulate the distribution of airflow in the airways. The entire respiratory unit served by one terminal bronchiole is called an acinus. Several adjacent acini make up a pulmonary lobule, which has incomplete connective tissue septae separating it from adjacent lobules. In addition to moving air to and from the alveolar space, the airways serve two important functions: condition the air and defense against foreign invaders. Air is warmed and humidified as it moves through the airways, a process aided by the increasing surface area of the airways with each successive generation. When ventilation is increased significantly, such as during heavy exercise in low humidity or at high altitude, humidification of the air can lead to significant loss of fluid through the respiratory tract. In conjunction with goblet cells and bronchial glands in the submucosa, the ciliated epithelium plays a critical role in defense against infection and other forms of injury. Mucus secreted by the glands traps particles that impact the airway wall. The cilia in adjacent cells clear this material by beating in a coordinated fashion with wave-like sweeps that move the mucous blanket towards the mouth where it is subsequently eliminated from the airway by coughing or swallowing. Mucociliary function, often referred to as the mucociliary escalator, is impaired by cigarette smoking and diseases that either affect the character of the mucous (e.g., cystic fibrosis) or ciliary function (e.g., primary ciliary dyskinesia). The mucosa and its ciliary function can be severely damaged in viral infections, such as influenza, predisposing to superimposed bacterial infection. Wave-like motion of the cilia within the sol layer moves the gel (mucous) layer mouthward.\\nArising from respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, the alveoli are the site of gas exchange with key structural features that facilitate that role. General Structure Alveoli are irregular polyhedrons approximately 250 um in diameter. They increase in number in early childhood to the average adult number of 300,000,000. Most of the alveolar surface is covered by alveolar epithelial cells, which have little cytoplasm and sit directly on a basement membrane. A layer of lipids, known as surfactant, whose functional significance is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4, resides on top of the epithelial cells. On the opposite side of the basement membrane are capillary endothelial cells, which are also very thin. The capillaries cover nearly 85-90% of the wall of the alveolus, providing a large surface area of 70 m2 for gas exchange across the entire lung. The capillary segments in the alveolar wall are so short that the capillary network essentially forms a nearly complete sheet of blood in the wall of the alveolus. The dotted line outlines a single alveolus. Note the dense network of capillaries (C) in the walls of this alveolus that forms a nearly continuous sheet of blood. Over much of the area where gas exchange takes place the epithelial and endothelial layers are essentially fused with no intervening space (interstitial space) between them.\\nSeveral specific structural elements of the alveoli warrant attention. There are two types of alveolar epithelial cells, which serve different functions: Type I Alveolar Epithelial Cells: Also referred to as Type I pneumocytes, these squamous cells comprise the bulk of the surface area of the alveolar space. They have little cytoplasm and form tight junctions with adjacent cells. Type II Alveolar Epithelial Cells: Also referred to as Type II pneumocytes, these are cuboidal cells located at the corners of alveoli. They are more numerous than Type I cells but comprise only 5% of the alveolar surface area. They have a microvillous surface and contain lamellated inclusion bodies that are likely the source of surfactant. Importantly, they are resistant to injury and help repopulate the alveolar surface following injury by giving rise to Type I cells. The two types of alveolar epithelial cells can be difficult to distinguish on microscopic exam. It is more important for you to understand the differences in function. Capillary Endothelial Cells Capillary endothelial cells are also very thin. The organelles generally reside around the nucleus, keeping the rest of the cell thin to facilitate gas exchange. Alveolar Macrophages Sometimes referred to as dust cells, these are the primary immune cellular constituent of the alveolar space and serve as one of the first lines of defense against foreign invaders by virtue of their ability to phagocytose inorganic and organic material and mediate key signaling pathways in the immune response. They can reside in the alveoli or the interalveolar septae (see below). Interstitial Space This refers to the space between the basement membranes that anchor the epithelial and endothelial cell layers. The space is exceptionally thin in many areas whereas in other areas it is a slightly thicker zone where fibroblasts, elastic fibers and collagen can be found. Certain disease processes, such as pulmonary fibrosis, preferentially affect this region of the lung parenchyma. Interalveolar Septum This is the shared or common wall between adjacent alveoli that contains the alveolar epithelial cell layers of the adjacent alveoli, the vasculature in between and the interstitial space. Pores of Kohn These are channels between adjacent alveoli that provide routes for collateral airflow, fluid movement, immune cell migration, and bacterial spread.\\nThe structure of the alveoli has several important implications - both good and bad - for respiratory system function. Efficient Gas Exchange The diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the alveolar-capillary barrier is extremely efficient due to the enormous surface area created by the millions of small alveoli and the exceptionally thin barrier across which the gases must diffuse. This high efficiency create significant reserve capacity for gas exchange; low levels of damage can occur that decreases the available surface area (e.g., emphysema) or thickens the alveolar-capillary barrier, but oxygen and carbon dioxide still have sufficient time to diffuse across the barrier and impaired gas exchange may not be clinically apparent. Maintenance of Alveolar Patency Alveoli must remain patent to adequately transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide across the alveolar-capillary barrier. Several structural elements prevent alveolar collapse - referred to as atelectasis - and preserve gas exchange. The first of these elements are the pores of Kohn noted above. If the airway leading to an alveolus is plugged with mucous for example, air can enter that alveolus through these collateral channels, thereby preventing collapse. If the pore of Kohn is not present, obstruction of the airway serving an alveolus leads to atelectasis of that alveolus. Pores of Kohn allow air to enter such alveoli and preserve their patency. Alveolar patency is also maintained through a phenomenon referred to as interdependence. All alveoli have a tendency to collapse to a smaller size due to the presence of surface tension. Because each alveolus is connected to multiple other alveoli through their interalveolar septae, the tendency of one alveolus to collapse exerts traction on neighboring alveoli that helps keep them open. Susceptibility to Injury The structure of the alveoli and the blood-gas barrier increase susceptibility to injury. While highly efficient for gas exchange, the enormous surface area of the alveoli increases exposure to toxic and infectious materials that escape airway defenses and make it to the alveolar space. In addition, unlike capillaries in muscle beds, which are surrounded and supported by adjacent muscle cells, alveolar capillaries are, aside from the thin layers of basement membrane and delicate epithelial cells, essentially surrounded by air. This leaves them highly susceptible to injury if intravascular pressure rises too high, as can happen, for example, when pulmonary capillary and venous pressure rise markedly in left heart failure. The arrows represent the forces promoting collapse of the alveolus to a lower volume. Note how each arrow is opposed by force exerted by adjacent alveoli. In skeletal muscle, the capillaries are buttressed by surrounding muscle cells. Alveolar capillaries are largely surrounded by air and lack this support, rendering them susceptible to injury when intravascular pressure rises. As in other areas of respiratory physiology, there are important differences between the children and adults with regard to airway and alveolar anatomy. Upper airway anatomy predisposes infants to be nasal breathers. Their tongue occupies more space in the mouth than in an adult and the epiglottis is nearly in contact with the soft palate. Airflow is thus preferentially directed through the nose. Over the first two years of life, the neck lengthens and the larynx moves downward, which facilitates more mouth breathing. The laryngeal structures are also floppier and the muscle activity that maintains airway tone is immature, which predisposes to airway narrowing with increased effort on inhalation. Newborns have the same number of airways as adults but they are much smaller in diameter, and therefore, have much higher resistance to airflow. They also have less smooth muscle, lack the cartilaginous support seen in adults and have increased density of mucous glands. Alveolar Space True alveoli do not form until 33 weeks of gestation. The lungs are not fully developed at birth, however, and alveolar multiplication continues up until 8 years of age. Newborns and toddlers also lack Pores of Kohn, which predisposes to atelectasis in the setting of airway obstruction (eg due to increased mucous production). The lungs are a unique system from an embryologic perspective in that they are unnecessary for intrauterine existence. However, they must develop enough that they are ready to function immediately following birth when the newborn takes its first breath. Prenatal lung development takes place in a series of stages.\\nChronic respiratory disease or congenital malformations can result from abnormalities in lung development. Bronchogenic Cyst. Abnormal budding of the 4th-6th weeks of embryogenesis, can cause development of fluid filled cysts that do not communicate with the bronchial tree. Many are asymptomatic and only detected on chest imaging done for other reasons while others present due to compression of adjacent structures or superimposed infection. Pulmonary Hypoplasia. This refers to incomplete development of the lung leading to a lower number of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli. from other developmental abnormalities, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia, that compress and impair development of the lungs. Tracheoesophageal Fistula. Abnormal division of the foregut into the esophagus and trachea can lead to abnormal communication (fistula) between these two structures. These can present in utero as polyhydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) or after birth as excessive secretions with drooling, choking, respiratory distress and poor feeding. Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia. Children born prematurely are at risk for a severe form of respiratory failure known as neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, which results from insufficient quantities of surfactant. Due to disruptions in the late canalicular and saccular phases some survivors develop chronic lung disease marked by decreased septation and alveolar hypoplasia and a persistent requirement for supplemental oxygen.\\nA core function of the respiratory system is to move oxygen from the environment into the bloodstream and deliver it throughout the body. In this chapter, we examine how this process unfolds under normal conditions. Describe the determinants of the partial pressure of oxygen in ambient and inspired air, the alveolar space, and arterial and venous blood. Explain the factors affecting the rate of diffusion of oxygen across the alveolar-capillary barrier. Delineate the mechanisms for transporting oxygen in the blood and predict the changes in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity in response to various factors. Define oxygen content and oxygen delivery and discuss factors that affect these variables. Predict changes in arterial and venous oxygen content and hemoglobin saturation in patients with dyshemoglobinemias and cyanide poisoning TERMINOLOGY This chapter and the remainder of the course employ a lot of terminology with which you will need to be familiar. These symbols are used with various subscripts, usually indicating location, and/or the specific gas involved: By convention, upper case subscripts are used for air spaces, and lower case subscripts for vascular locations. Placement of a little bar over the letter \"v\" refers to mixed venous blood (i.e., taken from the pulmonary circulation).\\nThe lung can be functionally divided into a conducting zone where no gas exchange takes place, and a respiratory zone consisting of the last few branches of airways and the alveoli where gas exchange occurs. Although the lung is complex from an anatomical standpoint, we can describe much of its gas exchange function and the handling of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) using simple models consisting of a conducting zone (straight or branched tube) and a respiratory zone (usually depicted as one or more circles comprising many alveoli) with blood flow. Before discussing how the respiratory system handles oxygen, it is important to define important concepts regarding the pressure of gases. If you place a single gas in a sealed container, the pressure of that gas (P) is the sum of the forces exerted by the gas molecules against the walls of the container. If you place a mixture of gases in a container, the pressure exerted by the kinetic energy of each separate gas is referred to as its partial pressure. This is sometimes referred to as the gas \"tension.\" The total pressure of the gas mixture is equivalent to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas (Dalton\\'s Law). If the total pressure of a gas mixture is known, the partial pressure of any component of that mixture can be determined by multiplying the total pressure by the fractional concentration (F) of the gas: PGas = PTotal x F. The concept of partial pressure also applies to gases in a liquid, including blood. When a liquid is in contact with a gas or mixture of gases, gas molecules diffuse into the liquid until the partial pressures in the liquid and overlying gas are the same. At this point, the rates of diffusion into and out of the liquid are equal. Pressure can be described in two ways. We express gas pressure in the atmosphere, alveoli or blood in terms of absolute pressure and use the unit mm Hg or torr (1 torr = 1 mm Hg under standard gravitational conditions). When describing respiratory system mechanics (e.g., airway pressure or pleural pressure) we instead use a concept referred to as gauge pressure, by which pressure is expressed relative to atmospheric pressure (which by convention is set as zero). By way of example, at sea level where the barometric pressure is 760 mm Hg, a gauge pressure of -10 mm Hg is equivalent to an absolute pressure of 750 mm Hg. The unit cm H2O is typically used for gauge pressure when discussing lung mechanics. The remainder of this chapter examines how the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) changes as oxygen moves from the environment, through the lungs, into the blood, to the tissues and back to the heart in the venous circulation. This series of changes is often referred to as the Oxygen Transport Cascade. While it is helpful for you to understand the normal values for the PO2 at each step in the cascade, it is more important to understand the factors that determine those values and why the differences occur between the different compartments. These are described in the sections that follow. The PO2 decreases as one moves from ambient air to the tissues. Mitochondrial PO2 (not depicted in this figure) may be less than 10 mm Hg in many tissues. Atmospheric air (also called ambient air) is a mixture consisting of 20.95% oxygen, 78.09% nitrogen and 0.03% carbon dioxide, with water vapor varying from 0% to 2% and diluting the other gases accordingly. For practical purposes we take oxygen as 21%, nitrogen as 79%, and ignore CO2 and the other gases. Atmospheric or barometric pressure (PB) is the pressure exerted by the kinetic energy of all the molecules in this atmospheric mixture. If the PB is 760 mm Hg at sea level, the PO2 of ambient air at sea level can be determined as follows: PO2 = PB x FO2 = 760 mm Hg x 0.21 PO2 = 160 mm Hg Because the total number of air molecules in the atmospheric mixture decreases as you move higher in elevation, PB decreases with increasing altitude, thereby causing a decrease in the ambient PO2. Note that the decrease in the PO2 with increasing altitude is solely due to the fall in barometric pressure, as the fractional concentration of oxygen remains the same regardless of elevation. As air enters the conducting airways of the respiratory tract it is rapidly warmed to body temperature and becomes fully saturated with water vapor, forming a gas mixture referred to as inspired air. The pressure associated with the water vapor must be taken into account when determining the partial pressures of the gases comprising inspired air. Based on Dalton\\'s Law, in the upper airways: PB = PN2 + PO2 + PCO2 + PH2O At a normal body temperature of 37°C, water vapor pressure is 47 mm Hg. Given a PB of 760 mm Hg, the partial pressure of the remaining dry gases is, therefore, 760 - 47 or 713 mm Hg. With this in mind, we can calculate the partial pressure of oxygen in inspired air in the upper airways (PIO2) at sea level as follows: PIO2 = (PB - 47 mm Hg) x FIO2 PIO2 = (713 mm Hg) x 0.21 PIO2 = 150 mm Hg We are interested in the PIO2 because, as discussed later in the course, patients can develop hypoxemia (low PaO2) if they have a low inspired PO2, due to a decrease in barometric pressure (e.g., high altitude) or FIO2 (e.g., a research project). Although water vapor pressure changes as a function of temperature and varies with changes in body temperature, for the purpose of this course we will assume water vapor pressure is always 47 mm Hg. After inspired air moves through the conducting airways, it enters the respiratory zone and eventually the alveoli where gas exchange occurs. The partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolar space (PAO2) is another major focus in clinical practice as it has a big effect on the downstream arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). In general, the PAO2 is a function of how much oxygen is delivered to the alveoli through ventilation and how much is taken away by the cardiac output to satisfy the body\\'s oxygen consumption requirements (VO2). To further develop this concept, we can use the analogy of a bathtub. The water level of a bathtub is determined by how much water is delivered to the tub by the faucet relative to how much leaves via the drain. The level of water in the tub can be taken to represent the PAO2. The faucet represents how much oxygen is brought to the alveolus (a function of the alveolar ventilation and the PIO2) while the drain represents how much oxygen is removed from the alveolus by blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries (cardiac output) and subsequently carried to the tissues to satisfy their oxygen consumption needs. The PAO2 is determined by the balance between how much oxygen is brought into the alveoli (the faucet; a function of alveolar ventilation and the PIO2) and how much is removed by cardiac output to satisfy oxygen consumption requirements (the drain). The relationship described above can be represented mathematically using an important equation, referred to as the Ideal Alveolar Gas Equation. PB is barometric pressure, PH2O is water vapor pressure, PaCO2 is the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide and R is the Respiratory Exchange Ratio, a variable discussed further below. The derivation of the equation is beyond the scope of the course. If one were to work through the derivation, it becomes apparent that the term on the left ([PB - PH2O] x FIO2) represents how much oxygen is delivered to the alveolus and the term on the right ([PaCO2/R]) represents how much is taken away to the tissues. This equation is actually a simplified version of a more complicated equation but is suitable for illustrating key concepts and for clinical practice. You will use the equation repeatedly through this class and when caring for patients, as it is very useful for determining the cause of a patient\\'s hypoxemia (low PaO2). The PAO2 calculated from this equation is a theoretical value that exists in the alveoli an ideal lung with normal ventilation-perfusion matching. In Chapter 6 we will see that the PAO2 in some regions is higher or lower than this ideal value based on alterations in ventilation and perfusion of those particular regions. Importantly, any factor that decreases the average alveolar PO2 across the lung causes a decrease in the arterial PO2.\\nWhile the concept of alveolar ventilation is reviewed in greater detail in the next chapter, it is useful to briefly discuss its meaning here as it will aid understanding of the determinants of the alveolar PO2. The volume of air that enters the respiratory system through the mouth and nose each minute is referred to as the minute ventilation. Some of that air fills the conducting airways (dead space ventilation) and only a portion actually makes it down to the alveolar space and participates in gas exchange. That portion of the minute ventilation that gets to the alveoli and participates in gas exchange is referred to as the alveolar ventilation. Decreases in alveolar ventilation relative to perfusion of the alveolus cause decreases in the alveolar PO2 and, subsequently, the arterial PO2. The Respiratory Exchange Ratio As noted above, the alveolar gas equation incorporates the Respiratory Exchange Ratio (R), a variable that reflects the body\\'s metabolic activity. Energy necessary for life processes is produced by oxidation of carbohydrates, protein and fats producing principally CO2 and H2O as breakdown products. As you may recall from earlier work in cellular metabolism, the respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio of metabolic CO2 production to oxygen consumption: RQ = VCO2/VO2. RQ varies based on the substrate utilized in the tissues. When metabolizing glucose, RQ = 1, whereas for fat, RQ = 0.7 and for protein RQ = 0.8. Thus, RQ for the entire body varies with the percentages of carbohydrate, fat, and protein oxidized at any given time. Ideally we would use RQ in the alveolar gas equation but this cannot be measured directly as it reflects activity at the cellular level. Instead, we use the Respiratory Exchange Ratio (R) in place of RQ.It represents the volume of CO2 eliminated and the net volume of O2 taken up by the lungs where each value is measured at the mouth by monitoring inhaled and exhaled gases. It is calculated in the same manner as RQ.In a steady state, or over a long period of time, R must equal RQ, but under other conditions, there are discrepancies between the two values (this is beyond the scope of this class). We do not regularly monitor gases like this on a clinical basis just to calculate R.Instead, we often assume it is 0.8 in the resting individual breathing ambient air. Oxygen moves from the alveolus into the pulmonary capillary by diffusion. Net movement in this manner occurs down a partial pressure gradient, that is, from higher to lower partial pressures. This process, which is passive and does not involve active transport, is governed by several factors: the partial pressure difference between the alveolus and the capillary blood; the molecular weight of the diffusing molecule; the length of the diffusion pathway (in the lungs, this pathway is very short); the total capillary surface area available for diffusion. Because the alveolar-capillary barrier is so thin and the surface area so large, diffusion occurs very quickly. While the average red blood cell spends about 0.75 sec in the alveolar capillaries (referred to as its \"capillary transit time\") oxygen crosses the membrane rapidly enough to raise the pulmonary capillary PO2 (PcO2) from the mixed venous value to the alveolar value (PAO2) within only 0.25 sec or less (Figure 2-5). Under normal conditions, complete equilibration between the capillary and alveolar PO2 occurs within only 0.25 seconds. Processes that thicken the alveolar-capillary barrier slow the rate of diffusion and delay equilibration. Processes that thicken the alveolar capillary barrier slow the rate of diffusion. As long as the individual remains at rest, there is enough time for the capillary PO2 to rise to the alveolar level. With exercise, however, cardiac output increases and capillary transit time may shorten and full equilibration may not occur. The surface area available for diffusion can be assessed by measuring the Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) during pulmonary function testing.\\nHow oxygen is transported once it enters the blood. Once oxygen diffuses into the pulmonary capillary, it is carried in the blood in two forms: bound to hemoglobin and in physical solution. All of the oxygen must pass through the phase of physical solution as it is taken up in the blood but the amount transported in solution is very small and only becomes clinically meaningful with a very high inspired oxygen fraction, with hyperbaric oxygen treatment or when the hemoglobin concentration is very low (anemia). Physical Solution Gases (O2, CO2, N2, and also CO, NO) are carried in physical solution in the blood in proportion to their partial pressure (Henry\\'s Law): C = a x P where C = concentration, a = solubility and P = partial pressure. The solubility of gases in liquid is temperature-dependent, decreasing as temperature increases. In the case of blood at 37°C, a for O2 is equal to 0.003 mL oxygen / 100 mL blood/mm Hg. From this information we can see that the amount of oxygen stored in physical solution in plasma and within the red cell cytoplasm is very small at an arterial PO2 of 100 mm Hg: Oxygen content = CO2 = (0.003 mL O2 / 100 mL blood / mm Hg) x 100 mm Hg CO2 = 0.3 mL per 100 mL or 3 mL per liter If oxygen were only transported in solution, an excessively high cardiac output of 320 liters/min would be required to carry 250-300 mL/min of oxygen (basal oxygen consumption) to metabolizing tissues. Because resting cardiac output is only 5 liters/min another means of transporting oxygen that greatly increases the oxygen carrying capacity of blood is necessary. Hemoglobin Hemoglobin is a tetramer consisting of 4 polypeptide chains (2a and 2b) each with its own heme complex capable of binding oxygen. One mole of hemoglobin can carry 4 moles of O2, which works out to 1.39 mL O2 per gram of hemoglobin. The blood of the average 30 year-old non-menstruating individual has a hemoglobin concentration of 15 grams per 100 mL blood (this value is typically a little lower in people who menstruate) and thus can potentially carry about 20 mL oxygen per 100 mL of blood as oxyhemoglobin. This is about 70 times more oxygen than is carried in physical solution at a normal PaO2. Under normal conditions the hemoglobin sites are never filled to capacity with oxygen. The % saturation of hemoglobin indicates the proportion of the total oxygen binding sites occupied by oxygen. The saturation (denoted as SO2) can be measured by two means. It can be directly measured from a blood sample using a technique called co-oximetry or it can be estimated using a probe applied to the skin, a technique referred to as pulse oximetry. When co-oximetry is performed on arterial blood, the saturation is denoted as SaO2 while measurements derived from pulse oximetry are denoted as SpO2. These terms are often used interchangeably in clinical practice and you will not need to distinguish between them for this course. Due to interactions between the hemoglobin chains as they bind oxygen, the relation between PO2 and Hb-O2 saturation is non-linear. Instead, it has a sigmoidal shape with key physiological advantages. In the normal arterial range (>70 mm Hg), the curve is fairly flat, so that moderate decreases in arterial PO2 cause only small decrements in saturation and O2 transport to the tissues. On the steeper portion of the curve, small changes in PO2 lead to large changes in saturation, a phenomenon that aids on-loading of oxygen in the lungs and off- loading in the tissues. A normal saturation of 97.5% occurs at a PO2 of 100 mm Hg. A decrease in PO2 to 60 mm Hg still allows the hemoglobin to be 90% saturated. A normal mixed venous oxygen saturation of 75% occurs at a PO2 of 40 mm Hg, where the term mixed venous refers to the mixture of blood that has returned to the lungs from the venous system. The Hb-O2 dissociation curve shows the % saturation (y-axis on the left) of hemoglobin at each PO2. The large dashed line shows the PO2 and % saturation of normal arterial blood while the small dashed line shows the PO2 and % saturation of venous blood. Factors Affecting The Affinity Of Hemoglobin For Oxygen. Hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen is variable and changes in response to multiple factors. The affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is described by the parameter P50 (the PO2 at 50% saturation). Decreased P50 means increased affinity or a shift of the curve to the left; increased P50 means decreased affinity or a shift of the curve to the right (Figure 2-7). Factors affecting the hemoglobin binding affinity for oxygen include: pH: When the pH is low and [H+] is increased (acidosis), H+ combines with Hb, leading to decreased affinity for oxygen and a shift of the curve to the right. PCO2: Increased PCO2 shifts the O2 dissociation curve to the right, while the unloading of CO2 from blood at the lung produces a left shift of the curve. This bidirectional shift is known as the Bohr effect. Part of this shift is due to pH change (change in [H+]) and part is due to CO2 binding to amino groups on the terminal ends of hemoglobin chains to form carbamino groups. Since PCO2 falls in the alveolar capillaries and rises in the tissue capillaries, the Bohr effect causes the curve to shift back and forth, improving both the loading of oxygen in the lungs and unloading of oxygen in the tissues. Note that decreased affinity means a lower saturation at a given PO2 (e.g., increased P50) while increased affinity means a higher saturation at a given PO2 (e.g., decreased P50). Decreased affinity occurs due to the following factors. Temperature: Increased temperature decreases hemoglobin-O2 affinity. In an actively working muscle the local change in temperature, as well as pH and PCO2, acts to enhance O2 unloading to support metabolic activity. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate: 2,3-DPG is an intermediate metabolite in the red cell metabolic pathway. Increased 2,3-DPG concentration decreases oxygen affinity by virtue of its binding to the hemoglobin molecule. Levels increase over a 6-24 hour period in response to anemia and hypoxemia and fall with blood storage. Hemoglobin Structure: Different hemoglobins have different affinities for oxygen. Human fetal hemoglobin, for example, has a P50 of 20 mm Hg (at 37°C, pH 7.4) as compared to a P50 of 27 mm Hg of adult hemoglobin A.Abnormal hemoglobins may have either high or low oxygen affinity. Arterial Oxygen Content (CaO2) The equilibration of blood with alveolar gas in the pulmonary capillaries determines the partial pressure of O2 in plasma and red cell cytoplasm. This would be the same even if hemoglobin were totally absent. The hemoglobin present is in equilibrium with the PO2; the saturation is determined by the shape and position of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve. Together, the oxygen dissolved in plasma and red cell cytoplasm and the oxygen bound to hemoglobin comprise what is referred to as the oxygen content or concentration of the blood. This can be represented mathematically as follows: O2 Content = ([Hb] x 1.39 x SO2) + (0.003 x PO2), where the term on the left represents the oxygen bound to hemoglobin and the term on the right represents the oxygen dissolved in plasma and red cell cytoplasm. This can be represented graphically in a slightly different version of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve where saturation is displayed on one y- axis (left side) and content for a given hemoglobin concentration is on the other y-axis. At any given PO2, the total content is determined by the sum of the oxygen dissolved in the blood and the oxygen bound to hemoglobin. Figure 2-8: The Hb-O2 dissociation curve with oxygen content. Content is on the y-axis on the right (assuming [Hb] = 15 gm/100 ml blood). At a given PO2, if you sum the content of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (Hb-O2, blue line) with the content dissolved in blood (grey line), you obtain the total oxygen content of the blood (black line). Using a normal value for PaO2 of 100 mm Hg, SaO2 of 97% and Hb of 15 g/100 mL, normal arterial oxygen content (CaO2) is calculated as follows: CaO2 = (15 g/100 mL x 1.39 mL/g x 97%) + (0.003 mL/100 mL/mm Hg x 100 mm Hg) CaO2 = 20.2 mL/100 mL + 0.3 mL/100 mL = 20.5 mL/100 mL There are several things to note regarding these relationships. First, it should be apparent that the dissolved component of oxygen makes little contribution to the total oxygen content. It is only when the PO2 is very high (e.g., a patient breathing an FIO2 of 1.0 or exposed to high barometric pressure in a hyperbaric chamber) that the amount of oxygen in solution increases to a modest degree. Second, above a PO2 of ~ 100-120 mm Hg, hemoglobin is fully saturated with oxygen. Any further increases in oxygen content above this PO2 occur as a result of the increase in the dissolved component. Third, the oxygen content is affected to a significant extent by the hemoglobin concentration. When hemoglobin concentration falls, for any given PO2, the oxygen saturation does not change but the total content decreases because there is less hemoglobin available to carry oxygen. Oxygen content as a function of PO2 and hemoglobin concentration. At any given PO2, as [Hb] decreases, content decreases but Hb-O2 saturation is unchanged. The arterial oxygen partial pressure and content. Blood leaving the pulmonary capillaries exits the lung via the pulmonary veins to the left atrium where it mixes with venous blood from other sources and is distributed throughout the body via the left ventricle. In an ideal system, the PaO2 resulting from the mixing process in the left heart would be the same as the alveolar and capillary PO2, but due to a variety of factors this is not the case; even in healthy individuals, the PaO2 is always less than the PAO2. This difference is referred to as the Alveolar-Arterial Oxygen Difference ([A-a]ΔO2). To understand the reasons for (A-a)ΔO2 in normal individuals, it is useful to refer to a simple model of gas exchange, known as the two-alveolus model (Figure 2-10). Figure 2-10: Basic model of gas exchange. Units have been left off the values for simplicity in the figure. For partial pressure, the units are mm Hg. For content, the units are ml/100 mL.In this model, the lung is treated as if it has only two alveoli. The individual (who has a hemoglobin of 15 g/dL) is assumed to have normal alveolar ventilation while breathing ambient air such that PAO2 = 100 mm Hg. Mixed venous blood returns to the pulmonary circulation with a PO2 of 40 mm Hg and oxygen content of 15 mL O2/100 mL blood. As the mixed venous blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries, there is complete equilibration between the capillary and alveolar PO2 such that PAO2 and PCO2 are equal. The oxygen content of the capillary blood (CCO2) is determined by calculating it or by using the value from the Hb-O2 dissociation curve (Figure 2-8). The blood from each side mixes in the left atrium yielding blood in the systemic arteries with a certain partial pressure (PaO2) and oxygen content (CaO2). CaO2 is determined from a weighted average of the content in each pulmonary capillary in the model based on how much blood flow goes to each side. In the example in Figure 2-10, there is equal blood flow to each lung unit. The PaO2 is then determined from the Hb-O2 dissociation curve. In this ideal model, notice that PAO2 and PaO2 are the same or, in other words, (A-a)ΔO2 is zero. This is not the case in real life. Instead, all individuals with normal lungs have an (A-a)ΔO2 of about 10-15 mm Hg. Why does this occur? You will recall from Human Form and Function that some bronchial venous blood drains into the pulmonary veins. Together with a small amount of coronary venous blood draining via Thebesian veins, this bronchial venous blood goes directly back to left atrium. Up to 5% of blood flow goes through these pathways and never travels through the gas exchange surfaces of the lung. 5% of blood flow does not pass a gas- exchange surface, leading to the development of a non-zero (A-a)ΔO2 even in healthy individuals. This includes some of the bronchial venous blood and blood from the Thebesian veins. Blood from the bronchial and Thebesian veins has a low venous oxygen content and partial pressure. When mixing occurs in the left side of the heart, this blood is added to the blood from the pulmonary capillaries. When you take a weighted average of the contents from each of these sources, the oxygen content is lower than in pulmonary capillary blood. PaO2 is now lower than the PAO2 and the individual has an (A-a)ΔO2 of 15 mm Hg. This phenomenon is referred to as a normal or \"physiologic\" shunt with the term shunt referring to blood that passes from the systemic venous to the systemic arterial circulation without meeting the gas exchange surface of the lung. The normal (A-a)ΔO2 increases with aging. You are not expected to determine changes with aging for the purposes of this course but should appreciate the general concept. The lung has structural and feedback mechanisms that create a balance between ventilation and perfusion of different lung units, such that blood flow is directed to regions receiving good ventilation while poorly ventilated regions receive less blood flow. This is called ventilation-perfusion matching and helps maintain a normal (A-a)ΔO2. Certain respiratory diseases alter the balance between ventilation and perfusion of alveolar units, leading to clinically significant hypoxemia and increases in (A-a)ΔO2, a situation discussed later in the course. Imbalances in ventilation-perfusion matching also occur with normal aging.\\nOxygen delivery to the tissues. The primary role of the cardiorespiratory system is to deliver oxygen to the tissues to support organ function. The amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues each minute is referred to as the DO2 and is calculated as follows: where Q refers to cardiac output. You will recall from the discussion above that Oxygen Delivery = Q x CaO2 arterial oxygen content is a function of several factors: CaO2 = ([Hb] x 1.39 x SO2) + (0.003 x PO2) These equations demonstrate that the major determinants of tissue oxygen delivery are the cardiac output and hemoglobin concentration. Small changes in PO2 following supplemental oxygen administration, for example, may change the Hb-O2 saturation but do not have as great an effect on oxygen delivery as changes in these other factors. This is particularly the case when the PaO2 is raised above 100 mm Hg, as hemoglobin is nearly fully saturated at that point (i.e., the flat portion of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve) and increases in the PaO2 do not increase the amount of oxygen loaded onto hemoglobin (Figure 2-8). However, when the PO2 falls on the steep portion of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve, small changes in the PO2 with oxygen administration cause large changes in SaO2, which can significantly improve oxygen delivery. Oxygen is off-loaded from hemoglobin at the tissue level and diffuses into the cells and eventually the mitochondria to support cellular respiration, a topic discussed in greater detail in the Molecular and Cellular Basis of Disease block. Diffusion is governed by the same principles described above for diffusion across the alveolar-capillary barrier and is aided by the low mitochondrial PO2 which creates an adequate pressure gradient for diffusion. As blood moves through the tissue capillaries, CO2 diffuses into the blood and PCO2 increases. As noted earlier, this decreases Hb-O2 affinity and facilitates offloading of oxygen (The Bohr Effect), making it more available for diffusion into cells. The venous oxygen partial pressure and content. The mixed venous partial pressure and content of oxygen are key parameters in the gas exchange process and become particularly important when there are abnormalities of ventilation-perfusion relationships and, in particular, areas of shunt (blood flow that bypasses a gas-exchanging surface). For this reason, it is important to understand the factors that affect PvO2 and CvO2. Oxygen consumption (VO2) is the amount of oxygen consumed by the tissues each minute and is a function of metabolic activity; it increases with physical activity and during hypermetabolic states such as infection or hyperthyroidism and declines due to, for example, hypothermia. It can be determined using the Fick Equation.\\nThis relationship demonstrates how the mixed venous oxygen content varies over time. If, for example, oxygen consumption increases in the face of constant blood flow, the arteriovenous oxygen content difference must increase. In other words, the tissues must extract more oxygen per mL of blood flowing through the capillaries, leading to a drop in C89O\" and a widened arteriovenous oxygen venous oxygen content difference and a decrease in C89O\" and P89O\". Normal values for C89O\" can also be derived from the Fick equation. In the resting state, if normal VO\" is about 250 ml/min and cardiac output about 5 L/min, then: content difference. Similarly, if oxygen consumption remains unchanged but cardiac output falls due to, for example, worsening left ventricular function following a myocardial infarction, the tissues respond by increasing oxygen extraction from the capillary blood.\\nResponses to changes in oxygen partial pressures. Decreases in the PO2 at various sites in the body lead to characteristic physiologic responses designed to counteract or prevent adverse effects of this change. These responses are seen in both healthy individuals exposed to ambient hypoxia by, for example, traveling to high altitude and those with cardiorespiratory diseases that cause hypoxemia. Ventilation Low arterial PO2 triggers an increase in minute ventilation referred to as the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR). This response, which is mediated by chemoreceptors in the carotid arteries and, to a lesser degree, the aortic arch (carotid and aortic bodies) varies in magnitude between individuals and causes characteristic changes in acid-base balance. This response is discussed in Chapter 8. Pulmonary Vascular System Decreases in the alveolar PO2 cause the pulmonary vasculature in that area to constrict, decreasing blood flow to that lung unit. Referred to as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), this response varies in magnitude between individuals and helps maintain a balance between ventilation and perfusion. When it occurs throughout the lung, it causes increased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. Cardiovascular System With acute hypoxemia, resting heart rate increases leading to an increase in cardiac output that helps maintain oxygen delivery to the tissues in the face of the diminished arterial oxygen content. This is mediated in part by increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Myocardial contractility is maintained in patients lacking significant coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathy. Hematologic System Decreased PaO2 causes an increase in serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration. If sustained, this causes an increase in hemoglobin concentration over a period of days to weeks that helps maintain arterial oxygen content and oxygen delivery in the face of the low PaO2. Finding an elevated hemoglobin concentration on laboratory testing can be a clue to the chronicity of a patient\\'s hypoxemia. Tissue-level Responses Many physiologic responses to hypoxemia occur at the cellular and molecular level due to the action of hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha). This transcription factor is degraded in normoxia but avoids degradation in hypoxia and travels to the nucleus where it combines with HIF-1beta, co-activator proteins and hypoxia response elements to activate genes affecting angiogenesis, endothelial function, erythropoiesis, glycolysis, mitochondrial function and other processes.\\nThe pediatric perspective on how we handle oxygen. The physiology described throughout this chapter is largely the same regardless of the age of the patient. One key difference between adults and growing infants, however, pertains to oxygen consumption. A growing infant has higher basal metabolic rate than an adult, with values for oxygen consumption about 2-3 times higher when adjusted for body weight. The required energy needs for growth and infant\\'s cardiopulmonary system to work at near maximum capacity in the resting state. Baseline infant respiratory and heart rates are thus higher. Even common challenges, such as fever, increase the metabolic demands on the system and contribute to respiratory compromise. In chronic pediatric disease, failure to thrive is a common indicator of the inability of the cardiopulmonary system to satisfy the demands necessary for normal growth.\\nDisorders of oxygen handling. Beyond the problems that cause hypoxemia and impair oxygen delivery, there are several important disorders of oxygen handling relevant to the concepts in this chapter that warrant consideration. Dyshemoglobinemias There are two clinically important disorders where hemoglobin is functionally altered and cannot carry oxygen even though the PO2 may be quite high. Carboxyhemoglobinemia: When an individual inhales a large amount of the gas (e.g., a car left running in a closed garage, exposure to smoke in a fire), blood carbon monoxide (CO) levels rise. Hemoglobin has 270 times the affinity for CO as oxygen and CO outcompetes oxygen for hemoglobin binding sites, forming CO-Hb. As a result, even though the individual may have an adequate PaO2, little oxygen is bound to hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired. Because CO also increases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen at the remaining binding sites, hemoglobin does not easily release what little oxygen it is carrying when it arrives in the tissues, providing another insult to tissue oxygen delivery. CO can also bind to and inhibit cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and interfere with oxidative phosphorylation. The overall degree of impairment depends on the amount of CO-Hb and duration of exposure. Severe injury and death can result from significant exposures (CO-Hb levels greater than 25% of the total amount of hemoglobin). The amount of oxygen that can bind to hemoglobin varies based on the amount of carboxyhemoglobin Methemoglobinemia: In this disorder, the ferrous iron (2+ valence) in the heme moiety is oxidized to ferric iron (3+ valence). This causes a conformational change in the hemoglobin molecule forming methemoglobin, which is unable to bind oxygen. As with CO poisoning, even though the PaO2 may be quite high, little oxygen is bound to methemoglobin and oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired. Congenital forms of the disorder may present in childhood but more commonly individuals develop this due to exogenous administration of agents capable of oxidizing ferrous iron, with the most common culprits being dapsone (used in the prophylaxis and treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia) and topical anesthetics in carboxyhemoglobinemia, where reads an appropriately high value for the oxygen saturation, in severe cases of methemoglobinemia, the pulse oximeter often reads a value near 87-88%. This occurs as a result of the methodology used to estimate oxygen saturation by the pulse oximeter benzocaine and cetacaine. Unlike typically pulse oximetry, a topic that is beyond the scope of this course. You should consider this disorder on the differential when a patient has low oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry that does not respond to supplemental oxygen, the arterial blood gas shows a very high PaO2 and they are receiving a culprit medication mentioned above. Once identified, the problem is treated by reducing iron back to the ferrous state by: (a) withholding the offending medication; and (b) in severe cases, administering methylene blue. Cyanide Poisoning Cyanide is a rapidly lethal poison that is absorbed through the respiratory tract, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract and skin. Humans are exposed through domestic fires (e.g., combustion of upholstery, insulation or plastics), industrial exposures (e.g., metal extraction, electroplating), diet (e.g., bitter almonds) and even medications used in the hospital (e.g., sodium nitroprusside). Cyanide uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria by binding to the ferric iron in cytochrome oxidase at the last step of the electron transport chain. This leads to cessation of oxidative phosphorylation, the net result of which is that the tissues must then rely on anaerobic metabolism to generate ATP.Because the tissues cannot utilize delivered oxygen, tissue oxygen extraction decreases, causing an increase in the mixed venous oxygen content and oxygen saturation. The venous blood appears bright red and the patients take on a cherry red complexion. They also often have an almond breath odor. Cyanide poisoning is treated by administering nitrites (amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite) and thiosulfate. Nitrites oxidize iron in the heme moiety to form methemoglobin. Methemoglobin binds cyanide, function. Thiosulfate then binds the cyanide to form thiocyanate, which is excreted by the kidneys. Hydroxocobalamin, a form of Vitamin B12, is also now included in treatment, as it binds cyanide to form the harmless cyanocobalamin. The pattern of abnormalities seen in cyanide toxicity, carboxyhemoglobinemia and methemoglobinemia are summarized later. PaO2 will be high if the patient was placed on supplemental oxygen. Cyanide poisoning can cause pulmonary edema and lead to hypoxemia. These three disorders affect oxygen transport to and utilization by the tissues even when the PaO2 is in an adequate range. Another source of problems for patients, and a major focus of attention in respiratory medicine are disorders that decrease the PaO2 itself, a phenomenon referred to as hypoxemia. The factors that cause hypoxemia are considered in much greater detail later.\\nHow We Handle Carbon Dioxide. Beyond moving oxygen from the environment to the tissues, another core role of the respiratory system is elimination of the major waste product of metabolism, carbon dioxide (CO2). This chapter examines this process in greater detail describing how carbon dioxide is transported to and eliminated from the lungs, the major factors that affect the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and the important concepts of hypo- and hyperventilation. Delineate the major mechanisms for transporting carbon dioxide in the blood. Describe the determinants of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Explain the relationships between minute, alveolar and dead space ventilation. Describe the relationship between alveolar ventilation and the partial pressures of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the alveoli and blood. Carbon dioxide production. CO2 is a byproduct of aerobic metabolism in the tissues. On average, we produce 200 ml/min of CO2 at rest although the amount varies based on the balance of carbohydrates, fats and proteins metabolized at any given time. For example, carbohydrate metabolism elaborates more CO2 than metabolism of fat. We represent the amount of CO2 produced per minute with the term VCO2. CO2 production increases during exercise or other hypermetabolic states such as fever or infection. It also increases when nutritional intake is started in a patient who was previously not consuming food, as metabolism of that food elaborates CO2. CO2 production declines as physical activity or nutritional intake decrease or with interventions such as neuromuscular blockade in select patients on mechanical ventilation or induction of hypothermia following cardiac arrest. The amount of CO2 produced each minute can be related to the amount of oxygen consumed each minute through the respiratory quotient (RQ) and respiratory exchange ratio (R). Carbon dioxide transport in the blood. All of the CO2 produced in the tissues must be transported to the lungs where it is eliminated through breathing or what is more appropriately termed \"ventilation,\" a concept discussed later in this chapter. This is the only mechanism for ridding the body of CO2 as, unlike other substances, it is not eliminated via the urine, sweat or metabolism in the liver. CO2 is transported in the blood in three forms. Physical Solution Some CO2 is transported in solution in the plasma and red blood cell cytoplasm. As with oxygen, the content of CO2 in physical solution is related to its partial pressure and solubility, which, under normal conditions, is: CO2 + H2O ==> H2CO3 ==> H+ + HCO3-. C = 40 mm Hg x 0.072 mL/100mL/mm Hg = 2.9 mL CO2/100 mL blood where C refers to content and the normal arterial partial pressure of CO2 is taken to be 40 mm Hg. The solubility of CO2 is over 20 times that of oxygen, and, as a result, more CO2 is stored in solution at physiologic partial pressures than oxygen. However, even though CO2 is more soluble, this mechanism is insufficient to transport all of the CO2 produced each minute to the lungs and other transport mechanisms are necessary. In normal individuals, only about 5% of CO2 is transported in solution. Combination with Protein Like oxygen, CO2 can also be transported by hemoglobin. Rather than binding to the heme moiety as oxygen does, CO2 binds to amine groups on the terminal ends of the hemoglobin chains, forming carbamino groups. At a normal arterial PCO2, carbamino binding accounts for about 5% of the total CO2 content of the blood. Bicarbonate By far the major storage and carriage of CO2 in blood is in the form of bicarbonate ion. In blood, CO2 rapidly combines with water to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates to form a hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. The second reaction is catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the red cell. CA About 90% of the total amount of CO2 carried in the arterial blood is carried in the form of bicarbonate ion. Haldane Effect As noted in Chapter 2, binding of CO2 to hemoglobin weakens the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen (Bohr effect). Conversely, changes in the PO2 and hemoglobin oxygen saturation affect CO2 transport through two mechanisms, collectively referred to as the Haldane Effect. First, as the oxygen saturation increases, hemoglobin\\'s affinity for CO2 decreases and, as a result, there is less carbamino formation. Second, oxygenation of hemoglobin promotes dissociation of H+ from Hb. Based on equation 1 above, the hydrogen ion combines with HCO3- to generate more CO2. Thus, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin causes more CO2 formation through release of CO2 from the terminal ends of the hemoglobin chains and dehydration of bicarbonate. The Bohr and Haldane effects work together to facilitate loading/offloading of O2 and CO2 in the lungs and tissues. As the pulmonary capillary PO2 increases when blood moves through the lungs, the Haldane effect assists in unloading CO2 from hemoglobin and conversion of HCO3-, leaving the CO2 free to diffuse into the alveoli. Similarly, as CO2 binding to hemoglobin decreases, the O2 affinity of hemoglobin increases and more O2 is loaded on (Bohr Effect). The opposite occurs in the tissues. The decrease in PO2 as blood moves through the capillaries helps upload CO2 onto hemoglobin and assists conversion of CO2 to HCO3- (Haldane Effect), while increased carbamino formation aids offloading of oxygen to the tissues (Bohr Effect). While we refer to the concept of CO2 transport in the blood, it is important to note that the process varies between the plasma and red blood cells. In plasma, CO2 is carried in solution or as bicarbonate. Because there is no free hemoglobin in plasma, there is no plasma carriage in the form of carbamino groups. The conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate is also slower in the plasma due to the lack of carbonic anhydrase. After diffusing into the red blood cell, CO2 is carried in solution, as carbamino or as bicarbonate. Bicarbonate formation in the red cell is extremely rapid because of the presence of carbonic anhydrase within the cell. The reaction is also facilitated by the fact that hemoglobin binds protons elaborated in that process, driving the reaction rightward. Of note, this proton binding contributes to the right shift of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve, thus enhancing oxygen release. Significant amounts of bicarbonate leave the cell in an electro-neutral exchange with chloride via the membrane anion exchanger AE-1. Thus, given that the majority of blood CO2 content is in the form plasma HCO3-, one can see how the red cell is critical for CO2 transport. The direction of these reactions and the movement of bicarbonate ion are reversed in the pulmonary capillaries. Uptake of CO2 in tissue capillaries and storage in plasma and red cells. CO2 Content The CO2 content of the blood is the sum of the CO2 carried in each of the three forms described above. As with O2, we can represent the relationship between PCO2 and CO2 content (CCO2) graphically. The quantity of CO2 carried in blood is greater and its curve is steeper than the Hb-O2 curve in the physiologic range of PCO2 (40-46 mm Hg). The physiologic range of partial pressures of each gas in the healthy state is denoted by the boxes with the dotted lines. There are two things to note in this relationship. First, while the overall relationship is curvilinear, the curve is essentially linear and very steep over the limited range between normal arterial and venous PCO2 (40 and 46 mm Hg, respectively). As a result, vast quantities of CO2 can be eliminated in the lungs with only small decreases in PCO2. In fact, as blood traverses the pulmonary capillaries, there is nearly as much CO2 eliminated by a 6 mm Hg change in PCO2 as oxygen is loaded onto hemoglobin by raising the PO2 by 60 mm Hg. The same applies with onloading and offloading of these gases in the tissues. This ability to load or unload CO2 with minimal change in PCO2 minimizes the change in pH between arterial and venous blood. Second, at any partial pressure, the total CO2 content of the blood is far higher than the O2 content. Since HCO3- is also present in the extravascular interstitial fluid, the body stores of CO2 are much greater than for O2. Thus, the CO2 content changes much more slowly than the O2 content after a change in ventilation or if breathing ceases (apnea or asphyxia). Diffusion of carbon dioxide into the alveolar space. Once the blood arrives at the lungs, bicarbonate ion is converted back to CO2 (reversal of Equation 1) and CO2 leaves the terminal ends of the hemoglobin chains. It then diffuses across the alveolar-capillary barrier into the alveolar space. This process is governed by the same factors that affect diffusion of oxygen and is a function of the surface area and thickness of the barrier, the partial pressure difference across the barrier and the molecular weight and solubility of CO2. As blood moves through the pulmonary capillary bed, the PCO2 falls from the normal mixed venous value of 46 mm Hg to the average normal arterial value of 40 mm Hg (there is a range of normal from 35-45 mm Hg). Because gas exchange for CO2 across the alveolar-capillary barrier is so efficient, the alveolar (PACO2) and arterial partial pressures (PaCO2) of carbon dioxide can generally be treated as equal to each other. The remainder of this chapter focuses on factors that affect the PaCO2 and how to determine why the PaCO2 may change in a given patient. Before discussing this topic, it is necessary to examine an important concept that serves as an important building block for that discussion, ventilation. Ventilation and its components. The total ventilation per minute, called the minute volume or minute ventilation is determined by collecting exhaled gas for a measured time. It is equal to the tidal volume (the volume exhaled in a single breath, VT) multiplied by the breathing frequency (f): VE = VT x f. Minute ventilation can be altered by many factors. In the case of altered lung mechanics, neuromuscular disease and severe morbid obesity, the individual may be able to maintain adequate minute ventilation at rest but not raise it adequately in response to stresses such as infection or exercise. Factors affecting minute ventilation are high altitude (via hypoxemia); neuromuscular disease (e.g., Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Botulism, Guillan Barre syndrome, Myasthenia gravis); minute ventilation changes due to changes in either tidal volume and/or respiratory rate. A high respiratory rate should not be equated with high minute ventilation. Ventilation is the combination of rate and tidal volume. A person with a high respiratory rate and high tidal volume will have high minute ventilation, whereas a high respiratory rate accompanied by very small tidal volumes, referred to as \"rapid, shallow breathing\" may cause low minute ventilation. Importantly, not all of the air we bring into the system from the environment each minute participates in gas exchange because not all of the air reaches the alveoli. In particular, the minute ventilation is divided into two components, dead space ventilation and alveolar ventilation. Dead-Space Ventilation When fresh air enters the respiratory system, it must first pass through the conducting airways: the nose, mouth, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and terminal bronchioles. These airways \"conduct\" air from the atmosphere to the alveoli but contain no alveoli and therefore do not participate in gas exchange. At the end of inspiration, the volume of air remaining in the conducting airways is the anatomic dead space (\"dead\" because it does not participate in gas exchange, but not stagnant because it is washed out with each breath). The effect of the conducting airways on ventilation is demonstrated in Figure 3-3. After inspiration is complete, atmospheric air and water vapor remain in the airways. On exhalation, this is the first gas to leave the respiratory system. After exhalation, alveolar gas (with CO2 added and O2 partially removed) fills the anatomic dead space. With the next breath, the air that remained in the anatomic dead space at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the alveoli. Thus, a tidal breath brings in 500 mL of air and causes a 500 mL expansion of the alveolar volume, but the volume of fresh air delivered to the alveoli is less than 500 mL by the volume of the anatomic dead space. In addition to the conducting airways, any alveoli that are ventilated with air but not perfused with blood do not participate in gas exchange. The ventilation going to these alveoli also acts as dead space and is called alveolar dead space. Ventilation to areas of lung with reduced, but not absent, perfusion can be treated as if a portion were going to alveoli with normal perfusion and a portion to alveoli with no perfusion. This latter portion is also part of the alveolar dead space. The physiologic dead space (VD). The volume of the anatomic dead space in a healthy adult is 150-180 mL. In a young healthy individual, there is little alveolar dead space, so the volume of the physiologic dead space is only slightly greater than this or about 25-35% of an average tidal volume (referred to as the VD/VT ratio). The anatomic dead space is not fixed, but increases at higher lung volumes because the intrapulmonary airways are pulled open to larger volumes as the alveoli expand with air but for the purposes of this class, we consider anatomic dead space to have a constant volume. With exercise, tidal volume may increase to 2.5 to 3.0 liters and VD/VT falls below 25-30%. Another contributing factor here is the increase in pulmonary blood flow, which eliminates any poorly perfused alveolar dead space. The physiologic dead space can increase in diseases of the air spaces and vasculature, primarily due to an increase in the alveolar dead space component. In general, increases in the \"physiologic\" dead space are almost always pathologic. The fraction of total ventilation \"wasted\" by the physiologic dead space can be calculated from arterial and expired gas values (See appendix to this chapter). Alveolar Ventilation The portion of ventilation that participates in gas exchange because it contacts perfused alveoli is the alveolar ventilation. It is that portion of the minute ventilation that is left over after accounting for the physiologic deadspace and is represented as. (4) The volume per minute of alveolar ventilation is critical, as this determines the amount of air presented to alveoli into which CO2 can be eliminated and from which O2 can be removed to deliver to the body. Putting the Components of Ventilation Together We can see from Equation 4 that alveolar ventilation can change due to changes in minute ventilation or changes in the physiologic dead space. We can look at these factors to explain why alveolar ventilation and, as a result, the PaCO2 may change in a given situation. The following cases illustrate this concept: Case 1: Anxiety Attack. Suppose an otherwise healthy individual all of a sudden becomes very anxious. This will cause an increase in minute ventilation (V!) due demonstrates what will happen to alveolar ventilation (V\"). The volume of the to an increase in the respiratory rate (f) and/or tidal volume (VT). Anatomic dead space is relatively fixed and if the lungs are healthy, we can assume there is no change in the volume of the alveolar dead space. Because the tidal volume has increased, the dead space fraction (VD/VT) decreases to 0.15. Because minute ventilation increases while the dead space fraction decreases, alveolar ventilation must increase. Case 2: Opiate Overdose. Suppose an otherwise healthy individual takes an overdose of an opiate medication. A major side effect of these medications is that they suppress minute ventilation due to a decrease in the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume. Table 3-3 demonstrates what will happen to alveolar ventilation. Time Pre- Overdose Current State The volume of the anatomic dead space is relatively fixed and if the lungs are healthy, we can assume there is no change in the volume of the alveolar dead space. As a result, the volume of the physiologic dead space (VD) is unchanged Because the tidal volume is decreased, the dead space fraction increases to 0.5. Because minute ventilation decreases while the dead space fraction increases, alveolar ventilation must decrease. In considering these relationships between minute, alveolar and deadspace ventilation, it is important to recognize that high dead space ventilation is a problem. When dead space ventilation or the dead space fraction is increased, an individual must raise their minute ventilation to compensate for this. Failure to do so reduces alveolar ventilation and, as discussed later in this chapter, limits their ability to eliminate CO2 or bring O2 into the body. High minute ventilation requirements do not pose a significant challenge for fit, healthy individuals, but for individuals with impaired respiratory mechanics due to severe underlying lung disease or neuromuscular disease it can be quite difficult to maintain high minute ventilation and adverse consequences can result. This problem will be revisited later in the course when we discuss these forms of lung disease.\\nThe arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Having discussed minute, alveolar and deadspace ventilation, we can examine the determinants of PaCO2, a critical parameter in respiratory medicine. The normal range for PaCO2 is 35-45 mm Hg. It can vary from this range due to normal physiologic processes, such as changes in breathing patterns during sleep or at high levels of exercise, or as a result of pathologic processes, such as lung disease, depressed respiratory drive following a substance overdose, neuromuscular weakness and a range of other problems. Specific terms are used to describe deviations in PaCO2 from the normal value. The terms hypocarbia or hypocapnia refer to a low PaCO2 (< 35 mm Hg) while the terms hypercarbia or hypercapnia refer to an increased PaCO2 (> 45 mm Hg). Whether the PaCO2 falls within or outside the normal range is determined by the balance between two factors: (1) the amount of CO2 produced as a result of metabolic activities and delivered to the lung by the individual\\'s cardiac ventilation; and (2) the amount of CO2 eliminated through the lungs through alveolar When the PaCO2 deviates from normal, we can use this relationship to explain why this occurred. Hypercapnia occurs because of either an increase in CO2 production and/or a decrease in alveolar ventilation, while hypocapnia occurs as a result of a decrease in CO2 production and/or an increase in alveolar ventilation. To understand these concepts, we can revisit the patient examples used above to explore the relationships between alveolar, minute and deadspace ventilation. Case 1: Anxiety Attack. We saw above that because the dead space fraction decreased, the increase in minute ventilation that occurred due to the anxiety attack led to an increase in alveolar ventilation. If the patient is without fever, remains at rest and has no other evidence of a hypermetabolic state, we can assume that CO2 production is relatively constant. Using the relationship in Equation 5 we can see that if CO2 production remains constant while alveolar ventilation increases, then PaCO2 must decrease. Case 2: Opiate Overdose. We saw above that because the dead space fraction increased, the decrease in minute ventilation that occurred due to the opiate overdose led to a decrease in alveolar ventilation. If the patient is without fever, remains at rest and has no other evidence of a hypermetabolic state, we can assume that CO2 production is relatively constant. Using the relationship in Equation 5 we can see that if CO2 production remains constant while alveolar ventilation decreases, then PaCO2 must increase. \\nHyperventilation and hypoventilation. Having discussed the factors that determine the PaCO2 and the relationships between minute, alveolar and deadspace ventilation, we can now examine two important concepts in respiratory medicine: hyperventilation and hypoventilation. Hyperventilation is defined as ventilation in excess of metabolic needs; alveolar ventilation is higher than necessary for a given level of CO2 production. Hypoventilation is defined as ventilation that is insufficient for metabolic needs; alveolar ventilation is lower than necessary for a given level of CO2 production. Hyperventilation and hypoventilation have important effects on the alveolar and arterial O2 and CO2 tensions. Hyper- and Hypoventilation and Carbon Dioxide Earlier, we emphasized that the PaCO2 was determined by the balance between the level of CO2 production in the tissues and the amount of CO2 eliminated via alveolar ventilation. From this relationship, we can see that with hyperventilation, alveolar ventilation is in excess of metabolic needs and PaCO2 decreases. On the other hand, with hypoventilation, alveolar ventilation is insufficient in light of the amount of CO2 being produced and PaCO2 increases. The PACO2 moves in the same direction under each condition. In fact, because gas exchange for CO2 is so efficient, we can treat the alveolar and arterial values as largely equivalent. Hyper- and Hypoventilation and Oxygen You will recall from the previous chapter that the PO2 in the alveolus is determined by the balance between how much O2 is delivered to the alveolus, which is a function of the alveolar ventilation and the PIO2, and how much is taken away from the alveolus to satisfy the metabolic demands (i.e., oxygen consumption needs) of the body. This relationship is encapsulated in the alveolar gas equation, which tells us the ideal PAO2 throughout the lung of an individual with normal ventilation-perfusion matching. From this relationship, we can see that with hyperventilation, alveolar ventilation is in excess of metabolic needs and PAO2 increases. On the other hand, with hypoventilation, alveolar ventilation is insufficient in light of the amount of O2 being taken away to satisfy the metabolic requirements and PAO2 decreases. They will vary from patient to patient depending on clinical circumstances. PAO2 is calculated using the alveolar gas equation. You will notice that in this discussion we have referred to the arterial values for CO2 but the alveolar values for O2. In general, when the relationship between PAO2 and PaO2 is affected by the ventilation-perfusion ratios the PAO2 declines with hypoventilation, PaO2 must also decrease, as this value cannot be higher than the alveolar value. How far it falls below PAO2 is determined by the adequacy of ventilation-perfusion matching. When the PAO2 increases with hyperventilation, PaO2 may increase if ventilation-perfusion matching is normal but will still be far below the PAO2 when ventilation perfusion matching is impaired as happens, for example, in pneumonia.\\nRegulation of arterial carbon dioxide tensions. The body carefully regulates PaCO2, with the goal of maintaining a value between 35 and 45 mm Hg. This is done by constantly adjusting ventilation based on the PaCO2 and metabolic activity. For example, if tissue CO2 production increases, the body maintains constant PaCO2 by raising minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation and eliminating more CO2 via the lungs. If CO2 production decreases, the body decreases ventilation and eliminates less. Similarly, if an individual intentionally hyperventilates for a short period and decreases their PaCO2, once they cease intentional hyperventilation, their basal level of ventilation declines until the PaCO2 rises back to the normal range. If you try to hold your breath as you continue to read this chapter, you will start to develop a strong urge to breathe; your PaCO2 is rising due to the lack of ventilation and the regulatory system wants to restore it to normal. The primary sensors that detect changes in PaCO2 are the central and peripheral chemoreceptors located in the brainstem and carotid bodies, respectively.\\nEffects of changing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Acute changes in the partial pressure (or gas tension) of carbon dioxide have various physiologic and clinical effects. Of these effects, one of the most important from a clinical standpoint is the change in mental status seen with acute hypercarbia. As the PaCO2 initially rises above the individual\\'s baseline, respiratory drive increases in an attempt to reverse the change in PaCO2. If the PaCO2 continues to rise, however, (> 75-80 mm Hg) depressed mental status ensues. This phenomenon, often referred to as \"CO2 narcosis,\" subsequently decreases respiratory drive, further exacerbating the hypercarbia and altered mental status. Various adaptations develop when changes in PaCO2 persist over time. For example, the kidneys compensate for increased PaCO2 and the subsequent decrease in pH by retaining bicarbonate in a process referred to as a compensatory metabolic alkalosis. This is described further in the renal portion of CPR.Similarly, the ventilatory response to changes in PaCO2 is diminished in patients with chronic hypercarbia, such that ventilation rises to a smaller extent in response to increases in PaCO2 when compared to an equivalent increase in a patient without chronic hypercarbia. The effect of acute and chronic changes in PaCO2 on minute ventilation is described further in Chapter 8. Appendix: Calculation of the Estimated Dead Space Fraction (Optional Material) The dead space fraction can be estimated using the following equation: It is important to note that in this case PECO2 refers to the mixed expired CO2, the average PCO2 over the entire exhalation. This parameter is different than a parameter we measure clinically in the hospital (end-tidal CO2 or PETCO2, the PCO2 at the end of a tidal exhalation) and can only be measured using specialized equipment or by collecting all of the gas exhaled by the individual and then measuring the PCO2 of that gas collection. It is for this reason, this calculation is not done on a routine basis in clinical care. Because this equation is not used frequently in clinical practice, we will not hold you responsible for knowing it for this class, including the exams.\\nThe movement of air into and out of the lung is the most basic function of the respiratory system. The properties of the lung and chest wall that govern this movement, are considered the \"mechanics\" of ventilation and are central to understanding both normal and abnormal lung function. This is the focus of this chapter. Describe the elastic properties of the chest wall and lungs and how these interact to determine functional residual capacity. Explain the mechanism by which air moves into the respiratory system on inhalation during spontaneous breathing and positive pressure ventilation. Describe the mechanism by which air exits the respiratory system on exhalation. Describe factors that affect respiratory system compliance. Delineate a list of factors that affect airway resistance. Describe the differences between laminar and turbulent flow. Compare respiratory mechanics between the extremes of age. Before describing the mechanics of the respiratory system in greater detail, it is useful to review several important terms and concepts. Terminology The following terms will be used throughout this chapter and the remainder of the course: Tidal Breathing: normal breathing at rest. The volume inhaled with each breath is referred to as the tidal volume (VT). Functional Residual Capacity (FRC): the amount of air left in the lungs at the end of exhalation during tidal breathing. FRC is essentially the \"set point\" for the respiratory system when all muscles of breathing are relaxed. Residual Volume (RV): the volume of air that remains in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. Total Lung Capacity (TLC): the volume of air in the lungs at the end of a maximal inhalation. We can depict these volumes graphically on a plot of lung volume versus time known as a spirogram.\\nThis can be written as: ΔP = Flow x Raw. The Spirogram, depicting tidal volume, FRC, RV and TLC. Key Concepts The following concepts are important for understanding the material that follows. Driving Pressure To generate and maintain the flow of air through the airways, it is necessary to create a pressure differential or \"driving pressure\" to overcome the resistance associated with the airway walls. This can be expressed mathematically as a relationship analogous to Ohm\\'s Law in the study of electricity (V=IR): Pressure Differential = Flow x Airways Resistance The term ΔP refers to the difference in pressure between where flow starts and where flow stops. How this driving pressure is generated during inhalation and exhalation is discussed later in the chapter. Transmural Pressure The respiratory system is similar to a balloon in that it is a distensible structure with elastic properties. If no pressure is applied to a distensible structure, it remains at what is referred to as its \"resting volume.\" Pressure must be applied across the wall of the structure to deviate from the resting volume (eg inflation of the balloon), whereas release of that pressure causes a return to the resting volume. Similar concepts can be applied to a spring or an elastic band. The pressure differential across the wall of a distensible structure is called the transmural pressure (PTM) and is determined by the pressure inside the structure (PIN) relative to the pressure outside the structure (POUT): PTM = PIN - POUT Transmural pressure is zero when a structure is at its resting volume. If transmural pressure is raised above zero by either increasing the pressure inside and/or decreasing the pressure outside, the structure increases in size above resting volume. The greater the transmural pressure, the higher the volume reached, as demonstrated in Figure 4-2. The numbers in the figure are hypothetical and have been inserted for illustrative purposes. Whenever the volume of a distensible structure is raised above its resting volume, the structure wants to recoil back to the resting volume. Positive transmural pressure must be maintained to prevent that from happening. Figure 4-2: Transmural Pressure. At resting volume, the transmural pressure is zero. The transmural pressure must be increased to raise the structure to a higher volume. A negative transmural pressure leads to compression of the structure below its resting volume. If, on the other hand, transmural pressure is lowered below zero by decreasing the pressure inside and/or raising the pressure outside, the structure decreases in size. The more negative the transmural pressure, the smaller the volume. This negative transmural pressure must be maintained to keep the structure at that small size. With release of the pressure, the structure moves back to its resting volume. How the application and release of transmural pressure plays a role in the different phases of the respiratory cycle is discussed later in the chapter. When describing transmural pressure, it is important to distinguish between the pressures that comprise the transmural pressure described above and the pressures that determine the driving pressure. Whereas transmural pressure is the difference between the pressure inside (Pin) and outside (Pout) a distensible structure, the driving pressure is the difference in pressure between where flow starts and where flow stops. For inhalation, therefore, the driving pressure is the difference between the pressure measured at the mouth, or atmospheric pressure (Patm) and the pressure in the alveolar space (Palv). On exhalation, the direction of flow is reversed and the driving pressure is the pressure in the alveolar space minus the pressure at the mouth. By convention, when describing lung mechanics, atmospheric pressure is treated as zero. Transmural pressure is sometimes referred to as the recoil pressure.\\nThe components of the mechanical system. The mechanical properties of the respiratory system are a function of several components including the lungs, chest wall, pleural space and muscles of respiration. Important features of these components affect the movement of air in and out of the respiratory system. The Elastic Properties of the Chest Wall The chest wall is comprised of the ribs, sternum, cartilage and the muscles of the thoracic cage including the diaphragm. Its elastic properties are such that when separated from the lung, it springs outward and increases in size. In essence, it acts like a jack-in-the-box toy, in which the spring wants to expand to a greater length and has a high resting or unstressed volume. Only when stretched to very high volumes (e.g., TLC) above the resting volume, does the chest wall move inward to a lower volume. To move the chest wall above or below its resting volume it is necessary to change the transmural pressure across the wall, which in this case is the difference between pleural and atmospheric pressure. The Elastic Properties of the Lungs When isolated from the other structures, the lungs always want to collapse to a lower volume. In essence, they act like a spring that always wants to recoil to a shorter length. More formally, we say that the resting or \"unstressed\" volume of the lungs is very small. To counteract this tendency to collapse to its resting volume, it is necessary to change the transmural pressure across the walls of the lung parenchyma. This transmural pressure - referred to as the transpulmonary pressure - is defined as the difference between alveolar pressure and pleural pressure. To expand the lungs on inhalation, it is necessary to raise the transpulmonary pressure above zero. Importantly, the volume of the lungs at any given time reflects this pressure differential rather than simply the pressure in the alveolar space. Lung volume is determined by the transpulmonary pressure, rather than the absolute pressure in the alveolus. The Combined Lungs-Chest Wall Unit The lungs and chest wall do not operate independently and, instead, are connected through the pleural space. As a result, the elastic properties of the respiratory system reflect a balance between the inward recoil properties of the lung and outward recoil of the chest wall (Figure 4-5). More formally, the transmural pressure of the entire respiratory system at any volume represents the sum of the transmural pressure across the chest wall and the transmural pressure across the lung. Figure 4-5: Spring model of the lungs, thorax and respiratory system. In isolation, the resting volume of the lungs (grey) is small while the resting volume of the thorax (black) is large. When connected to each other, the resting volume of the combined system is above that of the lungs and below that of the thorax. The arrows denote the direction in which each structure wants to move. Note how the recoil tendencies of the lung and thorax oppose each other. When individuals are relaxed and not using muscular force to inhale or exhale, the combined lung-chest wall unit is at a resting volume, somewhere between the small resting volume of the solitary lung and the large resting volume of the solitary chest wall. This volume, where a normal tidal breath begins and ends, is the functional residual capacity (FRC) and represents the volume at which the inward recoil of the lungs is balanced by the outward recoil of the chest wall. The elastic recoil of the chest wall and lung can be altered in various disease states, leading to changes in the balance between the lung and chest wall and, as a result, changes in FRC. The thickness of the arrows represents the strength of the elastic recoil of the lung (inward arrows) and chest wall (outward arrows). In emphysema, lung recoil is decreased and the normal chest wall pulls the system up to a higher volume at FRC.In lung fibrosis, lung recoil is increased and pulls the system to a lower volume at FRC.The Pleural Space The lung and chest wall move together during the respiratory cycle by virtue of their connection the pleural surfaces. Under normal circumstances, the space between the visceral and parietal pleura is small and contains only a few millimeters of fluid whose intermolecular forces hold the pleural linings of the chest wall (parietal pleura) and lung (visceral pleural) together, much like a liquid film does between two pieces of glass. The pieces of glass slide easily relative to each other but it is difficult to pull them apart. When the chest wall expands with contraction of the breathing muscles, the lung expands to the same volume due to the connection of the pleural space. Due to this connection and the tendencies to recoil in opposite directions, the pressure in the pleural space is negative throughout the respiratory cycle during resting breathing (about -5 cm H2O at rest at end-exhalation). Pleural pressure is positive during forced exhalation but is always less than alveolar pressure. The connection of the lungs and chest wall through the pleural space is nicely illustrated through the example of a pneumothorax in which air inappropriately enters the pleural space due to a penetrating injury to the chest wall. Due to communication between the pleural space and the space outside the chest, pleural pressure increases to atmospheric pressure (i.e., 0 cm H2O). This breaks the connection between the chest wall and lungs; the chest wall expands to a higher volume and the lungs collapse to a lower volume. More formally, the transmural pressure across the chest wall becomes zero and, as a result, the chest wall expands towards its resting volume. Transpulmonary pressure decreases and the lung moves towards its small resting volume. Panel A shows the transmural pressure and volume of the lung and chest wall at end-exhalation. Panel B shows the same information with a penetrating injury that enters the pleural space, causing pleural pressure to increase to zero. The transmural pressures of the lung and chest wall change such that they move to their resting volumes. Panel C shows a pneumothorax on chest radiograph. Note the small size of the collapse right lung compared to the normal left lung (outlined by dotted lines). The change in the size of the chest is not appreciated on this film. To move to a higher volume than FRC, work must be done against the lung\\'s tendency to recoil inward. The breathing muscles contract, enlarging the chest wall and pulling the lungs to a higher volume. Under resting conditions, this work is performed primarily by the diaphragm, the main inspiratory muscle, with a minor contribution from the external intercostals. If inhalation continues to the largest volume of gas that can be inhaled (TLC), one reaches a point where the muscle have to work against the tendency of the lung to recoil to a lower volume as well as against the chest wall, which is now above its resting volume and also wants to recoil inward. The thickness of the arrows represents the relative recoil tendency. At FRC, the recoil of the lung and chest wall are balanced. At total lung capacity (TLC), the lung and chest wall both recoil inward. Muscle activity is required to attain and remain at this volume. Muscle activity is also required to move to residual volume (RV) and overcome the outward recoil of the chest wall. The breathing muscles do essentially no work during exhalation at rest, as it is an entirely passive process. Once the volume of the lung-chest wall unit is increased above FRC, the unit wants to move to a lower volume; it easily recoils inward when muscular activity ceases at the end of inhalation. The energy stored as increased recoil pressure causes air to move out of the lungs. Expiratory muscle effort is required, however, to force air out of the system more rapidly than during resting exhalation (eg exercise or cough). Similarly, expiratory muscle effort is also required to exhale to volumes below FRC, as movement to such volumes requires work against the chest wall\\'s tendency to recoil outward.\\nMoving air in and out of the respiratory system. For gas to flow into or out of the lung, a pressure gradient must be generated along which gas molecules move from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure. As noted earlier, this is the driving pressure. On inhalation, pressure is higher at the mouth than in the alveoli leading to inward movement of gas, while on exhalation alveolar pressure exceeds the pressure at the mouth, leading to flow in the opposite direction. The remainder of this section considers how the driving pressure is generated during each phase of the respiratory cycle. Inhalation The mechanism by which the pressure gradient is generated varies based on whether the individual is breathing on her own (referred to as spontaneous breathing) or breathing with the aid of mechanical ventilation. Spontaneous Breathing The diaphragm plays the key role in generating the pressure gradient for inspiratory flow. Contraction of the muscle in response to signals relayed through the C3-C5 nerve roots and the phrenic nerves cause flattening of the diaphragm and descent into the abdomen. The diaphragm has the optimal length-tension relationship and contracts most efficiently when it is in the rounded shape. In some disease processes, the diaphragms are flattened due to lung hyperinflation, which impairs their contractile efficiency. The diaphragm contracts most efficiently when it has a rounded shape. Flattening of the diaphragm as seen with hyperinflation in emphysema impairs contractile efficiency. Descent of the diaphragm causes an increase in intraabdominal pressure, which, in turn, pushes up against the lower rib cage in the \"zone of apposition\" where the diaphragm lies against the chest wall. The flattened diaphragm also directly pushes against the ribs. The net effect of these dynamics is that the ribs move upward and outward, thereby increasing both the anterior-posterior and lateral dimensions of the chest. As noted earlier, because the lungs are connected to the chest wall through the pleural space, the lungs expand to the same volume as the chest cavity. Abdominal pressure pushes against the rib cage at the zone of apposition while the diaphragm also pushes against the lower ribs. This increase in the size of the lungs alters airway pressure in accordance with the principles of Boyle\\'s Law, which tells us that the for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature, the product of the pressure (P) and the volume (V) of the gas remains constant: P1 x V1 = P2 x V2. We can see that as the volume of the alveoli increases, the pressure within the alveoli must decrease. Alveolar pressure falls below the pressure at the mouth (atmospheric pressure, treated as 0 cm H2O gauge pressure), establishing a pressure gradient such that air flows inward. For a given mass of gas at constant temperature, as the volume of the container increases, the pressure decreases. As the volume of the lung increases, alveolar pressure decreases and gas flows into the lung. At rest in normal individuals, the diaphragm is the primary muscle responsible for generating the driving pressure with a minor contribution from the external intercostals. During exercise or other periods of stress, individuals often inhale larger than normal volumes or increase their inspiratory flow rate. In these situations, other muscles assist the diaphragm including the external intercostals, which pull the ribs upward and forward, the scalenes, which raise the first two ribs and the sternocleidomastoids, which raise the sternum. Mechanical Ventilation Instead of increasing the volume of the chest as a way to lower alveolar pressure, most modern ventilators create the pressure gradient necessary for inspiratory flow by raising the pressure at the mouth. It is for this reason that this method of respiratory support is referred to as positive pressure ventilation. Positive pressure ventilation can be done invasively by inserting an endotracheal tube into the patient\\'s airway or non-invasively by applying pressure through a tight-fitting mask attached to the patient\\'s face. Exhalation Whether the patient breathes spontaneously or with the aid of mechanical ventilation, exhalation at rest occurs through the same basic mechanism. As noted earlier, when the volume of the system is expanded above its resting volume (FRC) it has a tendency to recoil back to a lower volume. This elastic recoil results from elastic fibers in the lung tissue and a phenomenon known as surface tension (discussed later in this chapter). As soon as the inspiratory muscles relax and the transmural pressure is released, the inward recoil of the system increases the pressure in the alveolar space. Alveolar pressure rises above the pressure at the mouth, creating a pressure gradient along which expiratory flow occurs. The higher the volume to which the system was expanded on inspiration, the higher the recoil pressure and the greater the expiratory flow. In some disease processes (e.g., emphysema), destruction of alveolar septae and elastic fibers decreases the elastic recoil of the lung, leading to smaller increases in alveolar pressure at the start of exhalation and decreased airflow. At the start of inhalation in spontaneous breathing alveolar pressure (Palv) falls below atmospheric pressure. At the start of inhalation in positive pressure breathing, pressure at the mouth is raised above alveolar pressure by the ventilator. In both cases, air moves down the pressure gradient into the lungs. Exhalation from any lung volume is an entirely passive process for which no muscle activity is required. Muscle activity is necessary, however, to increase the expiratory flow rate or exhale to a lower volume than functional residual capacity. Contraction of the major expiratory muscles - the internal intercostals, rectus abdomini, obliques and transversus abdominus - causes an increase in pleural pressure. This pressure is transmitted to the alveolar space and augments the alveolar pressure resulting from elastic recoil, leading to a larger driving pressure between the alveolus and mouth and, as a result, greater airflow in early exhalation. This is very important for effective cough.\\nOptimizing muscle function in inhalation and exhalation. The force generated by the respiratory muscles is related to their length at the initiation of contraction. The force the respiratory muscles generate varies over the range of lung volumes because the length of the muscles changes as the respiratory system expands and contracts. The inspiratory muscles generate their greatest pressure (about 100 to 120 cm H2O) at the lowest lung volumes (i.e., near RV) and their pressure generating ability falls to zero at the highest lung volumes. You can experience this yourself by inhaling all the way to TLC and trying to initiate another inhalation starting at that high volume. It is far harder than if you start inhalation from FRC or RV. During inhalation, alveolar pressure falls below atmospheric pressure and air flows inward. During exhalation at rest, elastic recoil leads to increased alveolar pressure and airflow outward. With forced exhalation, alveolar pressure is higher and expiratory flow in early exhalation is greater. On the other hand, the expiratory muscles generate their maximum pressure (about 150-200 cm H2O) at higher lung volumes. This has important implications for cough, one of the respiratory system\\'s key defense mechanisms. When we are stimulated to cough, the body\\'s reflex reaction is to first inspire towards higher lung volumes where the expiratory muscles are at a more effective pre- contraction length. This augments the strength of the cough.\\nFactors affecting the movement of air. There are several factors that affect the ease of moving air in and out of the respiratory system, often referred to as the work of breathing. Compliance To increase the volume of a distensible structure, you must increase the transmural pressure across the wall of that structure. How much the volume increases in response to this pressure change is a function of the stiffness of the system. If the system is very flexible, small changes in transmural pressure yield the desired change in volume, whereas when the system is stiff, that same change in volume requires a much larger change in pressure. By way of example, consider the ease of inflating a balloon with your mouth. If the rubber that comprises the balloon is thin and very flexible, little effort is required to inflate it to a larger volume. On the other hand, when the rubber is stiffer or thicker, you must blow considerably harder to inflate it to the same volume. The stiffness of the system is more formally referred to as the compliance of the system, which indicates how much volume changes for a given change in pressure. This concept can also be represented graphically by examining a plot of respiratory system volume as a function of transmural pressure, referred to as a pressure-volume curve. The slope at any point of this relationship represents the compliance of the system at that lung volume: the steeper the slope, the more compliant the system. A noteworthy feature of the relationship is that the slope is not constant. It is flat (i.e., compliance is low) at very low and very high lung volumes but steep in the middle range of lung volume and, in particular, around FRC. The slope of the volume versus pressure relationship represents the compliance of the respiratory system. Note that the slope is flat and the compliance of the system is low at the extremes of lung volume. implications in compliance have significant Why Changes In Compliance Matter Changes for patients. When compliance decreases, for example, greater changes in transmural pressure are needed in order to expand the stiffer respiratory system to the intended volume. In other words, the individual must perform more physical work to inhale the same tidal volume than they would if compliance was normal. In mild cases, patients can sustain this work of breathing, albeit with increased dyspnea and exercise limitation, while in severe cases, patients may be unable to meet these demands and develop overt respiratory failure. Factors Affecting Compliance The compliance of the entire respiratory system is affected by features of the major components of the system and can be altered by disease processes affecting these components. Processes that increase compliance increase the slope of the pressure-volume relationship while factors that decrease compliance, decrease the slope of that relationship. Each component is considered below. Factors that increase compliance steepen the pressure-volume relationship while factors that decrease compliance cause a shift in the opposite direction. The stiffness of the lung parenchyma affects the overall ease or difficulty of inflating the respiratory system. To understand some of these effects, it is important to examine the concept of surface tension. Surface Tension: The millions of alveoli that comprise the lung parenchyma are lined by a thin layer of fluid. At any gas-liquid interface, the more tightly spaced molecules in the liquid have a greater attraction to each other than the more widely spaced molecules in the gas, creating a phenomenon known as surface tension. This phenomenon occurs at the interface of a gas and a liquid because the intermolecular forces (represented by the width of the arrows) of the closely packed liquid molecules (black circles) are greater than the more widely spaced gas molecules (open circles). In a fluid-filled, roughly spherical structure, such as an alveolus, the pressure generated by surface tension is described by the Law of LaPlace. The pressure is directed inward and tends to collapse the structure unless it is opposed by a transmural pressure applied in the opposite direction. Because alveoli have such small radii (100-150 um) you would expect the inward pressure to be very high and, as a result, it would require a lot of effort to prevent their collapse and open them on inhalation. This does not occur, however, because of an important molecule, surfactant. Surfactant: Known formally as dipalmitoylphosphatidyl choline, surfactant is a detergent produced by Type II pneumocytes that greatly reduces alveolar surface tension. On inhalation, surfactant molecules are interposed between the liquid molecules, decreasing their intermolecular forces and, as a result, surface tension. This increases compliance and reduces the muscular effort required during inhalation. Surfactant also plays a role during exhalation. As alveolar surface area decreases, the surfactant concentration increases. Even though the radii of the alveoli are decreasing inward, pressure remains low, thereby preventing alveolar collapse at low lung volumes. The valuable role of surfactant in maintaining adequate lung compliance is best demonstrated by a disease known as Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). Infants born before adequate concentrations of surfactant are produced in the third trimester of pregnancy have markedly increased alveolar surface tension. The decrease in lung and respiratory system compliance that results significantly increases the work of breathing while extensive alveolar collapse (atelectasis) contributes to poor gas exchange and hypoxemia. Infants typically present within 72 hours of birth with hypoxemia and respiratory distress, manifesting as tachypnea, grunting, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions and cyanosis. Treatment of severe disease requires mechanical ventilatory support and intratracheal administration of exogenous surfactant while mild cases may resolve spontaneously after 72 hours. Parenteral corticosteroids facilitate lung maturation and can be administered to the mother prior to the delivery of a premature infant to prevent this complication. Insertion of surfactant into the fluid layer lining the alveolus decreases intermolecular forces among the liquid molecules. Surface tension falls, leading to a decrease in pressure as determined by the Law of LaPlace. The size of the arrows reflects the magnitude of the inward pressure. Other factors that affect compliance of the lung parenchyma: the compliance of the lung parenchyma can increase or decrease in various disease states. Increased parenchymal compliance: By destroying interalveolar septae and elastic fibers within the lung parenchyma, emphysema increases the compliance of the lung tissue. On the surface, this might seem like a beneficial change but in reality it causes significant problems. It can lead to lung hyperinflation their contractile efficiency and impairs exhalation by decreasing elastic recoil and contributing to airway collapse at low lung volumes. the diaphragms and decreases flattens that Decreased parenchymal compliance: This can be seen with diseases that cause fibrosis (i.e., scarring) of the lung parenchyma or fluid accumulation in the alveolar and interstitial spaces (e.g., pulmonary edema). By decreasing compliance, these problems contribute to increased work of breathing. The Chest Wall: Certain processes distort the normal anatomy and/or stiffen the chest wall, thereby impairing its ability to expand normally on inhalation. The best example of this is kyphoscoliosis in which individuals develop abnormal curvature of the spine in both the coronal and sagittal plane. The Pleural Space: As noted above, the pleural space normally contains only a few milliliters of fluid and facilitates combined movement of the lung and chest wall. Excess fluid in the space (pleural effusion), pleural-based masses (e.g., mesothelioma) or thickening of the pleural surfaces due to chronic inflammation decrease respiratory system compliance and limit expansion on inhalation. The Abdomen: Abdominal distention limits descent of the diaphragm on inhalation, thereby decreasing respiratory system compliance. This phenomenon can be seen in patients with tense ascites (fluid in the abdomen), during the very late stages of pregnancy or as a result of abdominal pathology such as a bowel obstruction or abdominal compartment syndrome. Airways Resistance The other important factor that affects the ease of moving air in and out of the respiratory system is airways resistance (Raw). In general, resistance to flow of a substance (liquid or gas) is a function of three factors: viscosity of the substance, length of the tube (Raw is directly proportional to length), caliber of the tube (Raw is inversely proportional to r4). Why Changes in Airway Resistance Matter To understand the effect of changes in airway resistance on the effort required to move air in and out of the respiratory system, it is useful to review the relationship described earlier in this chapter: This relationship can be used to examine effects of resistance changes on inhalation and exhalation. Now suppose some factor increases airway resistance. To maintain airflow, the spontaneously breathing individual must increase the driving pressure (ΔP). This requires lowering alveolar pressure further than under normal circumstances, which requires increased muscular effort. Maintaining airflow in the face of higher resistance requires a larger pressure gradient between the alveolar space and mouth. Expiratory muscles must recruited to raise alveolar pressure higher than that created by elastic recoil alone. For reasons that are beyond the scope of this course, increased effort on exhalation does not always maintain airflow and, in some cases, actually causes premature airway collapse and limitation of expiratory flow. Failure to maintain airflow on exhalation can be a problem. If the individual is unable to exhale the entire tidal volume in the time available for exhalation, a small amount of air may be left in the lungs, a phenomenon known as air-trapping. When a lot of air is trapped in this manner, it can have a significant effect on respiratory mechanics. Of the factors noted above that affect airway resistance, the one with the greatest effect on the work needed to maintain airflow is clearly the radius of the airway. Whereas a doubling of the length of the airway, doubles resistance, decreasing the caliber of the airway by 50% causes a 16-fold increase in resistance and a significant increase in the effort needed to maintain flow. This issue is particularly important in children whose airways are much smaller adult airways. As a result, even small changes in airway radius have a disproportionately high effect on Raw and the work of breathing required to maintain airflow. Factors That Affect Airways Resistance Airway resistance is affected by multiple factors. Two of these factors are related to normal airway physiology. Lung volume: The airways are surrounded and tethered open by alveoli. As lung volume increases on inhalation, the enlarging alveoli exert more radial traction on the airways, pulling them to a higher caliber. With exhalation, the opposite happens; as lung volume declines, the tethering effect diminishes and the airway caliber decreases. At higher lung volumes, the alveoli exert greater radial traction on the airways, pulling the airways open to a higher caliber and decreasing Position in the bronchial tree: With each successive airway generation, the diameter of the airways decreases. As described in Chapter 1, however, even though the resistance associated with each individual airway increases, the enormous increase in the number of small airways causes a large increase in cross-sectional area for airflow such that total resistance is actually low. The remaining factors are more generally seen as pathologic problems rather than being a function of normal airway physiology. Bronchial muscle contraction: contraction of airway smooth muscle - a hallmark of asthma - narrows airway diameter and increases resistance. Airway secretions: accumulation of mucous in the airways, as happens in asthma exacerbations, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis and pneumonia, obstructs the lumen of the airway and increases resistance. Mucosal and peribronchial edema: Patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema can accumulate fluid in the interstitial spaces surrounding the airways, (\"peribronchial cuffing\"), which leads to airway compression. Edema fluid can also accumulate in and thicken the airway mucosa, narrowing airway diameter. Airflow Patterns Flow of gas through the airways generally follows one of two patterns, laminar and turbulent flow. In the former, all molecules move in a direction parallel to the long axis of the airway while in the latter, some molecules move parallel to the airway axis while others move in a variety of directions (Figure 4-19). Figure 4-19: Laminar vsTurbulent Flow. In laminar flow, all of the molecules move parallel to the long axis of the airway while in turbulent flow, molecules move in a variety of directions. Whether laminar or turbulent flow prevails at any given point in the airways is a function of a variable known as the Reynolds number (Re). This variable is determined by the radius of the airway lumen (r) and the velocity (v), viscosity (n) and density (d) of the gas and is represented mathematically as follows. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the tendency towards turbulent flow. When Do Laminar and Turbulent Flow Occur Under normal conditions, flow is more turbulent in the trachea due to the large radius and high gas velocity in that location, whereas laminar flow prevails in the smaller, more distal airways where gas velocity is low and the airway radii are small. A combination of both patterns can be seen at airway branch points. Certain pathologic states, however, increase the amount of turbulent flow. The best example of this is a tumor or other lesion narrowing the upper airways. In such cases, gas velocity increases due to the smaller radius, thereby leading to an increase in the Reynolds number. Why the flow pattern matters? Deviation from the normal balance of turbulent and laminar flow affects the effort required to move air. When laminar conditions prevail, the driving pressure required for airflow is directly proportional to the flow rate of the gas. In turbulent conditions, however, the driving pressure is proportional to the square of the flow rate. As a result, when an individual develops pathology that increases turbulent flow, she must generate a higher driving pressure to maintain the desired flow rate. This requires greater muscular effort and is a significant reason why people with upper airway obstruction commonly present with increased work of breathing and, in many cases, respiratory distress.\\nAssessing the relative contributions of resistance and compliance to the work of breathing. From a clinical perspective, it can be helpful to determine the extent to which resistance and compliance affect the work of breathing. In spontaneously breathing patients, the relative contributions of these parameters is difficult to measure and we rely more on clinical information (e.g., what is the underlying disease process) to guide our assessment. When patients are receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, however, we can examine a graph of airway pressure versus time to help sort out this question. The peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is the highest pressure reached during the respiratory cycle. Light grey bars denote the inhalation phase (I); dark grey bars denote the exhalation phase (E). The static pressure is measured when the ventilator is paused at end-inhalation (blue). It is lower than the PIP because there is no longer any work being performed against resistance. Inhalation (I) is marked in light grey while exhalation (E) is denoted in darker grey. Note that for reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, the pressure is maintained during exhalation at 5 cm H2O rather than allowing it to fall to 0 cm H2O.This is referred to as Positive End Expiratory Pressure or PEEP.The highest pressure reached during inhalation is the Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP) and reflects how hard the ventilator works to deliver the breath. More specifically, it reflects how high the pressure must be raised above the end-expiratory pressure to create a pressure differential sufficient to deliver the intended tidal volume. It is determined by the airway resistance and the compliance of the respiratory system. The higher the resistance and/or the lower the compliance, the higher the peak inspiratory pressure. To assess the relative contributions of resistance and compliance, the system is paused with the lungs inflated after the tidal volume is delivered (denoted in blue). There is no airflow during this pause and, as a result, the ventilator is no longer doing work against resistance. The pressure measured during this pause - referred to as the \"static\" or \"plateau\" pressure - solely reflects the pressure necessary to hold the system open at that volume. It is lower than the peak inspiratory pressure because there is no flow and thus no pressure needed to overcome the resistance of the airways. The relative contributions of resistance and compliance are determined by observing the height of the static pressure relative to end-expiratory pressure. The difference between the static and end-expiratory pressures is large, indicating that the compliance is the major determinant of the work of breathing. The difference between the end-expiratory pressure and static pressures is small, indicating that compliance is high (little pressure change is needed to inflate the system). When the static pressure is high relative to the end-expiratory pressure (Panel A), this suggests that the major determinant of the work of breathing is the low compliance of the respiratory system; a large pressure change is necessary to raise the volume of the system because the system is very stiff (ie low compliance). When the difference between the static and end-expiratory pressure is small, airway resistance is the major determinant of the work of breathing. Not a lot of pressure is necessary to increase the volume of the system because the system is very compliant. Most of the work of breathing in this case is done to overcome the airway resistance.\\nThe pediatric perspective on lung mechanics. The principles of moving air in and out of the respiratory system described above apply in both children and adults. There are, however, several important lung volumes. to compensate differences in the structure and mechanical function of the respiratory system in children that place them at greater risk during periods of respiratory stress. Chest Wall The infant chest wall is more compliant than the adult chest wall. As a result, FRC, which is determined by the balance between the inward pull of the lungs and the outward pull of the chest wall, is lower than in the adult. This decreases the lung\\'s oxygen reserves during periods of stress. Infants compensate for the decreased FRC by preventing complete exhalation to FRC through higher respiratory rates (shortened exhalation time) and increasing airway resistance through grunting. The ribs are more horizontal than in adults, which limits their movement as abdominal pressure rises on descent of the diaphragm. As a result, they have less ability to increase thoracic volume on inhalation. Diaphragm and Other Respiratory Muscles Unlike the adult diaphragm whose rounded shape allows for efficient contraction, the infant diaphragm has more horizontal insertion points, which decreases contractile efficiency. In fact, during contraction, the lower rib cage may paradoxically move inward, decreasing chest volume and wasting energy. This is more pronounced during periods of respiratory distress and leads to increased work of breathing Infants, unfortunately, have less ability to tolerate such stress because their respiratory muscles have less mass and fewer fatigue-resistant fibers, which limits their ability to sustain high workloads for long periods. Airway Anatomy As noted above, airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the airway raised to the 4th power, a significant issue in children whose airways are one-third to one-half the diameter of adult airways. Most adult airways are greater than 2 mm in diameter and, as a result, the small airways contribute little to total airway resistance. In the infant lung, however, the small airways are, in fact, very small, and contribute 50% of the airway resistance. Any factor that narrows the infant airway will also have a far greater impact on airway resistance than in an adult. For example, 1 mm of circumferential edema in the airway mucosa would cause a much higher percentage change in the diameter of the infant airway than it would in the adult airway and, as a result, would cause a much larger increase in resistance.\\nChanges in lung mechanics with aging. There are several important changes in lung mechanics with aging. Compliance Although lung compliance increases with age, overall respiratory system compliance decreases due to a decrease in compliance of the chest wall resulting from a combination of (1) kyphosis due to loss of vertebral height from osteoporosis and vertebral disc space narrowing and (2) stiffening of thoracic cage cartilage due to age-related calcification. Respiratory Muscle Strength The strength of the diaphragm and other respiratory muscles decreases with aging due to atrophy of the muscles and loss of fast twitch fibers. Combined with a decrease in mitochondrial ATP, these factors limit ventilatory reserve and predispose to respiratory failure during periods of increased demand and stress. Elastic Fiber Degeneration Elastic fibers begin to degenerate at around 50 years of age, leading to a decrease in elastic recoil and enlargement of the alveolar spaces. The loss of elastic recoil also decreases the tethering effect exerted on the airways by the surrounding airways, which subsequently predisposes to premature airway closure on exhalation, air-trapping and hyperinflation, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as \"senile emphysema.\"\\nComputed tomographic (CT) imaging is discussed in brief in a Human Form and Function session during the course but is not covered in this chapter. List the items to review when interpreting a chest radiograph. Employ clear descriptors to describe opacities in the lung fields and distinguish between alveolar and interstitial opacities. Use the silhouette sign to localize lung opacities. Identify abnormalities of the trachea. Describe the overall size of the heart, chamber size and clarity of the borders. Identify flattened hemidiaphragms and blunted costophrenic angles. Identify hilar opacities suggestive of lymphadenopathy or pulmonary artery enlargement. This chapter is an introduction to this topic. You will gain further experience reading chest films and learn about the chest radiologic findings in specific diseases in the course sessions devoted to those diseases. Additional optional information on chest radiograph interpretation can be found online. Except in a few instances, images are not included in this chapter and have instead been placed in an atlas that serves as a companion to this chapter. When indicated, you will be referred to the atlas for an example of an imaging finding or important concept discussed in the text. Chest radiographs are on the examinations in this course. You do not need to consult outside resources or the website noted above to prepare for these questions. Examples of any chest radiographs that may be on the exams will be in the syllabus, course lectures and, most prominently, in small group. Copies of the radiology files used in the conference materials will accessible through the course website to facilitate your review of this material.\\nBasic principles: radiographic density. An x-ray tube produces a point source beam of diverging x-rays that are directed at the object to be radiographed (the chest in this case). The x-rays that pass through the chest are recorded on photographic film. Some x-rays are removed from the beam (i.e., the beam is attenuated) by absorption in chest structures or by scattering that changes their direction away from the film. Thus the chest film is a two dimensional display of varying photographic light density. (Purists remind us that x-rays are invisible and cannot be \"looked at\"; the film image produced is a radiograph.) The density is determined by the relative transmission or attenuation of x-rays as they pass through the chest. Regions of high x-ray transmission (low attenuation) are recorded as black (lucency). The lung is recorded as dark grey because its high content of air allows most x-rays to be transmitted through it. Regions of low x-ray transmission (high attenuation) are white. Because of its composition, bone absorbs most of the radiation; little of the x-ray beam is transmitted to the film, and the bones are recorded as white. Areas of intermediate density (e.g., soft tissue) are displayed in shades of grey. Subtle distinctions in attenuation, such as between the heart and thymus gland, cannot be resolved with the standard chest radiograph. Computed tomography (CT) resolves such subtle differences in attenuation and more clearly distinguishes different types of soft tissues from each other.\\nChest radiograph interpretation. As with electrocardiograms, it is important to utilize a systematic approach when reading a chest radiograph; review the same items in the same order every time. The primary reason for doing this is to avoid a problem called the \"Satisfaction of Search, \"the tendency to \"lock-on\" to the most obvious finding in the film, satisfied that you have identified some abnormality, and overlook other important findings. This chapter presents the items you should consider as part of your system. Over the course of your training and beyond, you will read and hear about other approaches that vary in the order in which these items are reviewed. No one approach is superior to the other. The key thing is to develop a thorough approach and adhere to it. Preliminary Information It is important to begin chest radiograph interpretation by noting certain preliminary information. Failure to recognize problems in these areas can cause misinterpretation of various findings. Is this the correct patient and the correct date of the study? Is the film oriented properly? By convention, radiographs are viewed as if the observer is looking at the patient face on, with the patient\\'s right side towards your left as you view it. A marker on the film should indicate the patient\\'s orientation. The rare case of situs inversus can be misinterpreted without proper attention to markers. How was the film taken? Note whether the film was taken: - Posterior-Anterior (PA) vs Anterior-Posterior (AP): The standard chest film is taken PA, indicating the x-ray beam entered the posterior chest and the film is against the anterior chest. Portable (bedside) and supine films are usually taken AP with the film under the patient\\'s back. - Upright vssemi-upright vssupine: This can affect the way abnormal fluid or air is distributed and the width of the mediastinal structures. These issues are important because they affect the size of structures in the mediastinum and, in particular, the heart. On the standard chest film there is little magnification because the beam originates 6 feet from the patient so the rays striking the film are nearly parallel. On the AP film in which the beam originates only 3-4 feet away from the chest there is considerable geometric magnification from the diverging rays. Structures far from the film are more magnified than structures near the film. This is one reason the heart can appear larger on an AP film than on a PA film. Are the lung volumes adequate? Films should be taken with the patient at maximal inspiration. Capturing the image at expiration affects the size and density of the lungs. One challenge in film interpretation, however, is that certain pathologic states (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) decrease lung volume so even though the patient tries to take a deep breath and the technologist shoots the film at end-inspiration, the lung volume is low. In such cases, clinical history and other aspects of the film help determine if the low lung volume represents poor technique or pathology. Is the patient rotated? Misalignment of the patient relative to the x-ray beam and film distorts the appearance of mediastinal structures on the film. In non- rotated images, the clavicles are oriented at the same angle and spinous processes can be seen through the trachea. Is the film adequately exposed? Underexposed films (too light) lack the necessary information, especially in areas of greater attenuation such as the mediastinum. Overexposed films make the lung fields look too dark and obscure the normal lung markings. With digital imaging technologies, this is less of a problem as digital radiology terminals allow you to manipulate the exposure long after the radiograph was taken. Items to Examine in the Chest Radiograph Once these preliminary issues have been addressed, review the major components of the chest radiograph. The components and the questions you should address within each area are summarized below. The questions listed for each category are not an exhaustive list of items you should check but are, instead, an abbreviated list appropriate for this stage of your training. The order in which you proceed through these categories is not important as long as you devise/adhere to a system that allows you to examine each item every time you evaluate a radiograph. The discussion is focused on interpreting PA or AP projections. Interpretation of the lateral film will not be considered. Lines and Tubes Identify all catheters (often referred to as \"lines\"), tubes and other objects in the patient and ensure they are in the correct location. This includes, but is not limited to, central venous catheters, chest tubes, feeding tubes, nasogastric tubes, pacemaker/defibrillators, PICC lines and tracheotomy tubes. You will not be responsible of identifying these objects as part of this course. You will start doing this as part of your clinical work beginning next year.\\nIdentify lines and tubes in the film. Determine if the line and or tube is in the correct position side? Are there rib fractures or other broken bones (e.g., clavicle, humerus). Is there a lot or a little soft tissue? Is there air in the soft tissue? Is the trachea on the midline or deviated to one. Is the caliber of the trachea normal? Is the width of the mediastinum normal? Are the contours of the mediastinum normal? Is the aortic knob normal or enlarged? Can you follow the border of the aorta as it descends through the chest? Are the pulmonary arteries normal in size? Is there hilar lymphadenopathy? Is the heart shadow enlarged? Are the heart borders visible? Can lung markings be seen through the heart? Is the heart in the correct position or shifted to one Category Lines and Tubes Bones and Soft Tissues Trachea Mediastinum Aorta Hilum Heart Diaphragms Pleural Space Lungs side? entire length? Can the diaphragms be visualized? Are the diaphragms round or flattened? Are the costophrenic angles sharp or blunted? Can lung markings be seen out to the chest wall along its entire border? Are there any opacities? - Focal, multifocal or diffuse? - Alveolar or interstitial? - Where are they located? Are there any masses or nodules? Are there abnormal areas of lucency? Bones and Soft Tissues Examine the visible bones (ribs, clavicles, humeri) to identify any fractures. Rib fractures can be classified as acute or old depending on their radiographic appearance. The soft tissues appear white and homogeneous under normal circumstances. The amount of soft tissue should be noted (e.g., thin, obese) and whether the amount has changed over time. For example, loss of soft-tissue over time could be a sign of pathologic or intentional weight loss depending on the clinical scenario. Scan the soft-tissue for areas of lucency. This is indicative of air in the soft-tissues (subcutaneous emphysema), which, depending on the clinical circumstances, is a sign of barotrauma such as pneumomediastinum. Unilateral absence of a breast shadow is usually indicative of a prior mastectomy and, therefore, a history of breast cancer.\\nThe trachea has central lucency because it is air-filled. It should descend into the chest along the midline and spinous processes should be visible through the structure. Note whether the trachea is deviated to one side and whether the caliber of the trachea is uniform along its entire length or whether there is an area of constriction. The remainder of the airways is normally visualized only to the level of the mainstem bronchi. Mediastinum The mediastinum refers to the middle portion of the chest and contains a significant number of structures including the aorta, esophagus, heart, lymph nodes, pulmonary vessels, and proximal airways. When examining the mediastinum, note whether the width is normal or enlarged and whether there are any irregular contours. Supine or low volume films can make the mediastinum look wider than it really is. When irregular contours are noted, the lateral film can be used to identify whether the mediastinal abnormality is located in the anterior, middle or posterior mediastinum. This is important for generating differential diagnoses for observed abnormalities but is beyond the scope of this course. Aorta The ascending aorta is only occasionally seen to the right of the spine. The aortic knob should be on the left side of the spine and you should be able to track its course as it descends through the chest close to and to the left of the vertebral bodies. When examining the aorta, note whether the knob and the remainder of the aorta are normal in size or enlarged, whether the aorta follows the expected course as it descends in the chest, and whether you can follow its border along its entire length. Lung opacities abutting the aorta, for example, may obscure the border. This is referred to as the silhouette sign, a concept discussed further below. Hilum This is the area at the superior margin of the heart shadow and includes the pulmonary arteries and, in pathologic states, hilar lymph nodes. The branching tubular structures radiating from the hila are arteries and veins, which cannot be distinguished from each other on the chest radiograph. The caliber of these structures progressively decreases towards the lung periphery, being barely detectable in the outer third of the lung. On a supine radiograph, the caliber of comparable-sized vessels supplying the upper, middle, and lower lungs is uniform. On an upright radiograph there is a normal distribution of blood volume by gravity so that vessels in the lower lungs are larger than those in the upper lungs. When examining the hilum, note the size and position of the pulmonary arteries, which can be enlarged in patients with pulmonary hypertension or pulled upwards in response to scarring (e.g., old TB). Also note whether there are enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Distinguishing between lymph nodes and vessels can be difficult and sometimes requires a chest CT scan. The Heart There are several items to note when examining the heart.\\nSize: The width of the heart should be less than one-half the width of the chest at its widest point. Be sure to note the adequacy of the film in assessing this issue, as low lung volumes and supine and AP films can distort the size of the heart. Position: The bulk of the heart should be seen to the left of the spine with only a little visible to the right of the spine. It can shift position in response to lobar or whole lung collapse or very large pleural effusions. Chamber enlargement: Left atrial enlargement causes a convexity on the upper left heart border and splaying of the carina while left ventricular enlargement can give the heart a \"boot-shaped\" appearance. Right atrial enlargement causes the right side of the heart shadow to bulge too far to the right of the spine. Right ventricular enlargement is best appreciated on the lateral film by obscuration of the retrosternal airspace. Clarity of the borders: Lingula and right middle lobe opacities can obscure the left and right heart border, respectively. This is described further below. Retrocardiac space: Lung markings and the descending aorta should be visible through the heart. Opacification of this area is suggestive of a process in the retrocardiac space, such as atelectasis or pneumonia. Diaphragms The right hemidiaphragm is usually a little higher than the left hemidiaphragm due to the liver. The diaphragms should be rounded and visible along their entire lengths from the spine to the edge of the chest wall. Flattened diaphragms are seen in patients with hyperinflation due to emphysema while obscuration of part or all of a diaphragm is suggestive of a lower lobe process or pleural effusion. You should also note whether there is abnormal lucency under the diaphragm, an important sign suggesting the presence of pneumoperitoneum (free air in the abdomen). The Pleural Space The pleural space is generally not seen on the chest radiograph and only becomes apparent in pathologic states. The lung should extend all the way to the chest wall and diaphragm and there should be a sharp, easily seen angle between the lateral aspect of each diaphragm and the chest wall (costophrenic angle). There are two situations in which this is not the case and there is a problem involving the pleural space. Pneumothorax: When air accumulates in the pleural space, the lung collapses to varying degrees. In such cases, we see lung markings out to white/grey line and then an area of lucency (black) between that line and the chest wall. These changes can be obvious or subtle. Pleural Effusions or Masses: When fluid or masses occupy the pleural space, we see lung markings out to an area of opacity between the edge of the lung and the chest wall. This phenomenon is called \"pleural separation.\" Large effusions appear as dense, homogenous opacities that obscure the diaphragm and part or all of a heart border, while smaller effusions may only be recognized as blunting of the normal costophrenic angle.\\nThe only thing you should see in the lung fields is the normal blood vessels (often called \"vascular markings\" or \"lung markings\"). As noted above, these markings progressively decrease in size as they move toward the lung periphery and are barely detectable in the outer third of the lung. The lungs should be examined for two issues: (1) abnormal areas of lucency that lack normal lung markings (seen in emphysema and/or bullous lung disease) and (2) opacities. When opacities are observed, several features should be noted: Are they diffuse, focal or multifocal? Where are they located and how are they distributed (central vsperipheral, upper vslower lung zones, bilateral vsunilateral)? Are they alveolar or interstitial? Do they have a nodular or mass-like appearance? Is there evidence of cavitation (i.e., central lucency)? Several aspects of describing lung opacities warrant further attention. Alveolar and Interstitial Opacities: When describing opacities in the lung, an important distinction is often made between alveolar and interstitial opacities. Alveolar opacities refer to the fact that something (blood, pus, water, protein or cells) is filling the alveolar space, while interstitial opacities refer to the fact that something is filling the interstitial space. Alveolar opacities tend to look fluffy and white with very little lucency, while interstitial opacities are more net-like or \"reticular\" in appearance. Because the alveoli are often uninvolved and still air-filled, these opacities often have a lot of lucency among the opacities (i.e., the holes in the net) It is not always possible to distinguish between the two types of opacities but when this distinction can be made, it is helpful for generating differential diagnoses for observed abnormalities.\\nDescribing Nodules and Masses: The identification of a discrete opacity in the lung is one of the most important functions of the chest radiograph. Rounded lesions < 3 cm in diameter are classified as \"nodules,\" while larger lesions are called \"masses.\" Finding large masses is easy, but it can be difficult to find nodules smaller than 1 cm in diameter. Lesions smaller than 5 mm are below the threshold of detection unless densely calcified or multiple as in miliary tuberculosis. When you identify a nodule or mass, you should describe several features including: Solitary or multiple? Borders: Smooth contours? Spiculated? Irregular? Calcification? When a nodule is identified, it is useful to review old films if they are available. A nodule that has not grown for two years or more is likely to be benign whereas an enlarging nodule or mass could represent malignancy or infection. Localization of Abnormalities and the Silhouette Sign: Knowledge of the anatomy of the lung is helpful in evaluating segmentally distributed pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia or a lung mass. An important clue to the location of a pulmonary opacity is the loss of a normally visible contour when a structure of similar density is juxtaposed to this contour. Normally, objects are seen as distinct from each other because of difference in density. For example, there is a clear border between the heart and lungs because these objects have very different radiographic density. If the lung adjacent to the heart is filled with pus, however, the radiographic density is similar to that of the blood-filled heart and a clear border is no longer seen. This loss of a normal profile or silhouette is called the \"silhouette sign\". A common example of this sign is the loss of the right heart border when pneumonia or atelectasis develops in the right middle lobe. Right lower lobe processes do not obscure the right heart border and, instead, obscure the right hemidiaphragm.\\nThe right heart border in this film is obscured by a large mass in the right middle lobe. Normally a clear border is seen between the lung and heart because the objects have different densities. Since the density of the mass and the heart are similar, a clear heart border is no longer seen. Because the process does not involve the lower lobe, the entire diaphragm is still visible. lung. When normal bronchi are not visible because they contain air and their walls are too thin to be resolved against the surrounding background of air-filled is visible within intrapulmonary bronchi it means they are surrounded by \"water\" density. The \"water\" density may be inflammatory exudate (e.g., pneumonia), blood (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage), edema, airless collapsed alveoli or even malignancy (e.g., lymphoma). \"Air bronchogram\" is the term used to describe the tubular, air- containing bronchus that becomes visible because it is embedded in diseased lung with abnormally high density. This is an indication of parenchymal lung disease, usually \"air space\" (i.e., alveolar) disease. If the bronchi are filled with fluid (e.g., mucus plugs) rather than air, the air bronchogram sign is absent despite the disease in surrounding alveoli. In that case, you only see an area of increased density on the radiograph. The arrows point to airways that can be seen because they are surrounded by densely consolidated lung parenchyma. The airways are visible because they are air-filled and have much lower density than the consolidated lung around them.\\nAtelectasis is loss of lung volume due to collapse of alveolar spaces. Mild areas of lung collapse may produce coarse horizontal linear densities (plate-like atelectasis), usually at the lung bases. When a larger volume, such as a lobe, collapses, certain radiographic signs suggest atelectasis. Direct signs fissures, crowded vessels, and increased density of the affected lung. Indirect signs reflect a response of the remaining aerated lung and chest to the area of collapse and include mediastinal shift towards the area of collapse, diaphragmatic elevation, and compensatory over-inflation of other lobes. You will not be responsible for identifying signs of lobar or whole lung collapse on chest radiographs in this course. These examples are included to demonstrate the principles of how the findings on plain radiographs change when large portions of the lung collapse.\\nComputed tomography (CT) scanning has several advantages over conventional radiography including: (1) having the image plane transverse to the long axis of the body, giving a \"third view\" of many pathologic processes; (2) greatly improving contrast among tissues of nearly the same density; and (3) obviating the superimposition of normal structures that may hide pathology. CT is useful in locating small tumors, especially metastatic nodules that are invisible on conventional radiographs because of small size (and corresponding faintness of shadow) or because of obscuration by overlying mediastinum, diaphragm, or vessel. CT is also the standard technique for evaluating the mediastinum for masses, lymph node enlargement, tumor infiltration or vascular abnormality. Mediastinal abnormalities stand out clearly because of their contrast against the normal mediastinal fat. For the same reason, CT is the best technique for evaluating abnormalities of the chest wall. CT is also much more sensitive at showing pleural masses and loculations of intrapleural fluid or air and for assessing the vasculature. CT interpretation is beyond the scope of this course and you will learn more about this imaging modality in the remainder of your training. CHEST ULTRASOUND Ultrasound is now widely used as part of the evaluation of patients with respiratory insufficiency and other issues such as shock of unclear etiology. With proper technique, chest ultrasound can be used to rule out pneumothorax, identify pleural effusions and guide sampling of pleural fluid (thoracentesis), identify areas of lung consolidation due to, for example, pneumonia, and identify patients with pulmonary edema as the primary source of their respiratory insufficiency. A detailed discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this course and you will not be expected to interpret chest ultrasound images on the exams in this course. You will gain further exposure to acquiring and interpreting ultrasound images later in your training.\\nThis document contains a series of images that demonstrate normal and abnormal findings regarding many of the items you need to examine as part of a system for reading chest radiographs. It is not an exhaustive list of the imaging findings and patterns you will see and is, instead, designed to provide representative examples for you to use as you start building your radiology skills. Further examples of these and other findings will be presented in conference materials and other course resources.\\nBoth of these films have a marker \"L\" in the upper left (yellow circle) noting the left side of the patient. If you did not have this, you might think the film in Panel B was flipped the wrong way. Instead, it is oriented correctly; the patient has a problem known as Situs Inversus.\\nPosterior-Anterior (PA) and Anterior-Posterior (AP). Two films taken of the same patient on the same day. The top film is a PA projection while the bottom is an AP projection Even though the lung volumes appear the same in each film indicating the depth of inspiration was similar, the size of the heart is larger in the AP film. This demonstrates why it is important to note the technique - as well as whether the patient is supine or upright - when commenting on the size of the the heart.\\nTwo films from the same patient at different phases of the respiratory cycle. Panel A shows the patient at full inspiration. Panel B shows the patient at full exhalation. Compare the difference in the size of the heart, appearance of the lower lung fields and the hilar region in the two films. Variation in lung volumes indicative of pathologic states. Panel A shows a patient with low lung volume due to pulmonary fibrosis. Panel B shows a patient with normal lung volumes. Panel C shows a patient with large lung volumes from hyperinflation due to emphysema.\\nTwo films from the same patient on the same day. In Panel A, the patient has normal alignment, while in Panel B, the patient is rotated. Note how the mediastinum and heart shadow look bigger than in Panel B.Clues to the presence of rotation are the asymmetry of the clavicles and the fact that the spinous processes are not seen within the lumen of the trachea (next page).\\nThe arrows point to the spinous processes \"within\" the trachea. (they are actually behind the trachea) This is one clue to the fact that the patient is aligned properly on the radiograph. In this patient, the spinous processes (arrows) are \"outside\" the trachea. This patient is not aligned properly (i.e., they are rotated). Adequate exposure: lung markings can be seen in the lung field. Intervertebral disc spaces are just visible between the vertebral bodies Underpenetrated: Everything looks too white. Intervertebral disc spaces cannot be seen between the vertebral bodies. Overpenetrated: The lung field looks too black and lung markings cannot be seen within it. The white arrows point to the rib fractures. Note how if you trace the upper margin of each rib you see a discrete point of discontinuity. Soft Tissue: Amount 11 Minimal soft tissue: note how little is seen outside the edge of the chest wall. Soft Tissue: Abnormal Lucency B A 12 Panel A shows a patient with normal soft tissue. Note that it is homogenous grey/white in appearance. Panel B shows a patient with lucency in the soft tissues (arrows). These are the dark areas noted by the arrows. These areas of lucency are due to air in the soft tissues, a finding referred to as subcutaneous emphysema. The normal trachea descends into the chest along the midline of the body. Spinous processes (arrows) can be seen through the lumen of the trachea in a non-rotated patient. The diameter remains relatively uniform along the length of the structure. In many normal cases, the lower portion of the trachea deviates slightly to the right side of the chest to the side of the aortic knob. These films demonstrate patients with a normal mediastinum. In the area around the trachea (paratracheal region) as well as lower down there are no abnormal bulges or contours. The only bulge seen is that of the aortic knob (arrows), which is normal. The width of the mediastinum is also normal in both films. Paratracheal mass due to a thyroid mass: Note the abnormal density to the right of the trachea (arrow) Mediastinal mass from germ cell tumor: The contour of the mediastinum is abnormal on the left and the right and the mediastinum is far wider than normal. The mediastinum is too wide, with abnormal density seen to the right and left of the trachea. The patient had lymphadenopathy from lymphoma.\\nThe aortic knob is on the patient\\'s left side and is not too large. The descending aorta follows a relatively straight course down through the chest and you can see the shadow as it travels behind the heart. The aortic knob is on the correct side in both of these films but is much larger than normal. The width of the descending aorta is also large. These findings can be seen in aortic aneurysm or aortic dissection. These two entities would be distinguished by the clinical history and further imaging with computed tomography. Note how the descending aorta can no longer be seen as it moves behind the heart. There is also an absence of lung markings in this area. These findings suggest there is an opacity behind the heart (retrocardiac opacity). The left and right pulmonary arteries (PA) extend from the hilum in the middle of the chest and divide into smaller vessels as they move away from this area. The pulmonary veins also travel through this region on their way to the left atrium. The white arrows point to the enlarged pulmonary arteries in this patient with pulmonary hypertension The same film is on the left and right. The solid line shows the normal course of a pulmonary artery. The dotted line shows the actual course of the pulmonary artery which has been pulled upward by scarring from TB. Left ventricular enlargement. Note the \"boot shaped\" appearance of the left ventricle. Left atrial enlargement. The arrow points to the abnormal convexity in the upper left part of the heart that is the enlarged atrium. This area is normally flat or somewhat depressed inward. Normal retrocardiac space: note that lung markings can still be seen through the heart. Retrocardiac opacity: note that the heart appears densely white and lung markings can no longer be seen. Flattened diaphragms can be seen in a patient with emphysema.\\nLeft lower lobe opacity obscuring the left hemidiaphragm. Note how the right diaphragm is more easily seen. Right lower lobe opacity obscuring the right hemidiaphragm. The right heart border is also obscured in this film, suggesting this process involves the right middle and lower lobes. The left diaphragm is well visualized along its entire length.\\nAlthough present on both sides, it is more prominent on the right side in each film. Unless a patient has undergone some surgical procedure in the abdomen (eg PEG placement or laparoscopic surgery, this finding is indicative of a perforated hollow viscus and therefore a surgical emergency.\\nNormally, the pleural space, is not seen on a chest radiograph due to the fact that it represents a small space between the visceral and parietal pleural. In this film, note that the lung extends all the way out to the chest wall along its entire margin. Also note the sharp angle that the diaphragm makes with the chest wall (costophrenic angle; highlighted by the circle).\\nThis film demonstrates findings commonly seen when an entire lung collapses due to, for example, a mass or as objects move to take up the space. mucous plug in the left main bronchus. There is a dense opacity on that side (the collapsed lung). Notice how the trachea and heart have shifted over to the left. This film demonstrates findings commonly seen with right upper lobe collapse. There is a dense opacity in the right upper lung field. Note how the minor fissure has shifted from the normal position (white dotted line) up to the position denoted by the black dotted line. This is expansion of the right lower lobe due to the collapse of the upper lobe. The right diaphragm is also higher than it should be due to the volume loss in the right upper lobe.\\nWhy Is This Patient Hypoxemic? One of the primary manifestations of many lung diseases and a common reason for clinical evaluation is a decrease in the arterial PO2, a problem referred to as hypoxemia. The goal of this chapter is to explore the pathophysiology of hypoxemia and the clinical approach to identifying the cause in a given patient. Describe methods to identify hypoxemia. Describe the five major causes of hypoxemia and the expected response to supplemental oxygen administration in each case. Discuss the effects of changes in ventilation-perfusion ratios on alveolar partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Use clinical data to determine the cause(s) of hypoxemia in a patient.\\nWhat constitutes hypoxemia? Hypoxemia refers to a low partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood. This is different than the term hypoxia, which refers to an inadequate level of tissue oxygenation to support cellular metabolism. A patient can have a normal PaO2 (normoxemia) but still have hypoxia if oxygen delivery to the tissues is impaired due to low cardiac output or severely reduced hemoglobin stores. Similarly, a patient can have a low PaO2 but not have tissue hypoxia if cardiac output increases and hemoglobin stores are normal. In the clinical setting, it is not uncommon for people to conflate hypoxemia and hypoxia and use the terms interchangeably but this is not technically correct. A low PaO2 should be referred to as hypoxemia. The question that then arises is what constitutes a low PaO2 and, therefore, hypoxemia. In healthy young to middle age individuals with normal alveolar ventilation at sea level, the average PAO2 breathing ambient air is 100 mm Hg (calculated from the ideal alveolar gas equation described in Chapter 2). If gas exchange is normal and, therefore, the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference ([A-a]ΔO2) is normal (10-15 mm Hg), this yields an expected PaO2 of 85-90 mm Hg. Slightly lower normal values are seen in older individuals, as the normal (A-a)ΔO2 increases slightly with age. When the PaO2 falls below these levels, the patient is deemed to have hypoxemia or be \"hypoxemic.\" In weighing whether the PaO2 is \"normal\" or \"abnormal\", however, it is important to consider several factors. First, one must consider the FIO2. A patient may have a PaO2 of 90 mm Hg, for example, but if they require supplemental oxygen with an FIO2 of 0.8 to achieve that value they have abnormal gas exchange, as breathing an FIO2 that high should yield a much higher PaO2. Second, it is important to consider the altitude at which the measurement is completed. A healthy individual on the summit of Mt. Rainier (14,410 ft.) is likely to have a PaO2 of 50- 55 mm Hg. While this low value constitutes hypoxemia, given the decreased barometric pressure at high altitude and its affect on the alveolar PO2, it is clear that a PaO2 of 50-55 mm Hg constitutes normal gas exchange at that elevation.\\nHow we identify hypoxemia. In the clinical setting, the most commonly used tool to identify if a patient has hypoxemia is the pulse oximeter. The device assesses arterial oxygenation by shining two wavelengths of light through a fingertip and detecting how much of the light is transmitted to a detector on the other side of the digit. Because hemoglobin absorbs the wavelengths of light differently depending on how saturated it is with oxygen, varying amounts of light are sensed by the detector depending on the patient\\'s clinical condition. The device then uses an internal algorithm to convert the pattern of light absorption in the finger to an estimate of the arterial oxygen saturation. The devices are called \"pulse\" oximeters because they sense the pulsatile blood flow and take measurements of the arterial blood during flow into the finger. Given that the saturation is directly related to the PO2 through the Hb-O2 dissociation curve, this information can be used to assess whether the PaO2 is normal or low. Pulse oximeters are simple and fast, but do have pitfalls such as the fact that they do not work well if the digits are hypo-perfused due to severe peripheral vascular disease or vasoconstriction following the use of vasopressors. When more definitive information is required about the PaO2, the gold standard is the arterial blood gas. This provides a direct measurement of the PaO2, as well as, which allow assessment of the information about the PaCO2, pH and HCO3 adequacy of ventilation and the patient\\'s acid-base status. The pulse oximeter provides no information about the adequacy of ventilation (i.e., the PaCO2). Finally, the accuracy of pulse oximeters may be affected by differences in skin pigmentation, which has raised issues regarding whether the widespread use of these devices in the clinical setting contributes to health disparities. This issue is discussed further in an appendix to this chapter.\\nThe causes of hypoxemia. In general, hypoxemia develops due to one of five potential reasons: low inspired partial pressure of oxygen (PIO2), hypoventilation, diffusion impairment and shunt Low VA/Q (i.e., low ventilation-perfusion ratio) To understand how each of these problems causes hypoxemia, we can separate them into two broad categories based on the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference ([A-a]ΔO2). Recall that due to the 5% physiologic shunt (venous blood returning directly to the left side of the heart through the bronchial and Thebesian veins), all normal individuals have an (A-a)ΔO2 of 10-15 mm Hg. Even with normal gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary barrier, the arterial PO2 always falls below the alveolar PO2. For the first two causes of hypoxemia noted above, the PO2 decreases but the (A-a)ΔO2 remains normal, telling us that the main problem is the process of getting oxygen to alveoli throughout the lung. Gas exchange across the alveolar-capillary barrier is normal. For the other three causes, the decrease in PaO2 is accompanied by an increase in the (A-a)ΔO2, indicating the main problem is with diffusion across the alveolar-capillary barrier or an imbalance between ventilation and perfusion of various lung units. Each of these categories is considered further below. To understand how these all of these processes cause hypoxemia, we must return to the basic model of gas exchange in the lung. For the purpose of simplicity, we will leave out the normal 5% shunt and use the idealized model. Throughout the chapter, specific numbers are included in the examples provided for illustrative purposes and should not be committed to memory. The terms CaO2, CcO2 and CvO2 refer to the oxygen content of the arterial, pulmonary capillary and mixed venous blood, respectively. Figure 6-1: Basic model of gas exchange. Units have been left off the values for simplicity. The terms starting with the letter C (e.g., CaO2) refer to oxygen content of the blood. For partial pressure, the units are mm Hg. For content, the units are ml/100 mL. Causes of hypoxemia associated with a normal (A-a)ΔO2. For each of the two causes associated with a normal (A-a)ΔO2, the fundamental problem is a decreased influx of oxygen to the alveoli throughout the lung. This figure demonstrates how this causes hypoxemia while preserving the (A-a)ΔO2. In the panel on the right, some process causes decreased oxygen influx to all alveoli in the lung. Because oxygen influx into the alveoli has fallen relative to the amount taken away by the cardiac output to satisfy oxygen consumption needs (the efflux) the PAO2 falls throughout the lung. The lung is otherwise normal. As a result, gas exchange remains normal across the alveolar-capillary barrier and the capillary PO2 fully equilibrates with the PAO2 on both sides. When mixing of blood from the two lung units occurs in the left side of the heart, the resulting PaO2 is the same as the PAO2. PaO2 is decreased relative to the normal situation, but there is still no alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (If we were to include the normal 5% physiologic shunt in this model, the PaO2 would be 10-15 mm Hg below the PAO2). This pathophysiology is seen when hypoxemia is due to either a low PIO2 or hypoventilation. Each is considered in more detail below. Low Inspired Partial Pressure of Oxygen The PIO2 is decreased at altitude, where barometric pressure declines, or by breathing a low FIO2, as might be the case in a research study. Referring back to the ideal alveolar gas equation, we see that a decrease in the PIO2 leads to a decrease in the PAO2. This slows diffusion across the alveolar-capillary barrier but as long as red blood cell transit time in the pulmonary capillary remains adequately long, complete equilibration still occurs between the alveolar and capillary PO2, albeit at a lower PO2 than would be the case when breathing a normal PIO2. In these situations, PAO2 and PaO2 decrease in tandem and the (A-a)ΔO2 remains in the normal range. Supplemental oxygen easily corrects the hypoxemia associated with a low PIO2 by raising the FIO2 and, therefore, the PAO2. When PIO2 falls, the PAO2 decreases and diffusion across the alveolar-capillary barrier is slowed. The pulmonary capillary PO2 rises to the alveolar value but equilibration occurs at a lower PO2 and subsequently leads to a decrease PaO2. Hypoventilation As discussed in Chapter 3, hypoventilation is defined as a level of alveolar ventilation insufficient to eliminate the CO2 produced in the tissues. The hallmark is an increased PaCO2 (> 45 mm Hg). Such a change may occur, for example due to an overdose of sedative medications that suppresses respiratory drive or a neuromuscular disease, like myasthenia gravis, that limits an individual\\'s ability to maintain minute ventilation. As a result of hypoventilation, there is less oxygen influx to the alveoli relative to how much is taken away to satisfy the oxygen consumption needs of the body, leading to a decrease in the PAO2. The change in the average PAO2 across the lung can be determined from the ideal alveolar gas equation shown above. The decreased PAO2 leads to a lower pulmonary capillary and arterial PO2. Note that CO2 is not replacing oxygen in the alveolus. Instead, the increased PaCO2 is a marker of hypoventilation and decreased oxygen influx to the alveolus. Because PAO2 and PaO2 decrease to the same extent, the (A-a)ΔO2 remains normal. The hypoxemia due to hypoventilation can be corrected with supplemental oxygen because the higher FIO2 increases PAO2, thereby leading to increases in both the capillary and arterial PO2. The better solution to hypoxemia in this situation, however, is to correct the source of the hypoventilation and restore adequate oxygen influx to the alveolus.\\nCauses of hypoxemia associated with an increased (A-a)ΔO2. For the other three causes of hypoxemia, there is a problem with gas exchange within the lung. In particular, there is a problem with diffusion across the alveolar- capillary barrier or matching of ventilation and perfusion that causes not only a decrease in PaO2 but also an increase in the (A-a)ΔO2. Diffusion Impairment An abnormality in diffusion, such as a thickened alveolar wall or decrease in the available surface area, slows the rate of oxygen transfer across the alveolar- capillary barrier. This rarely causes hypoxemia because there is still sufficient time for the red cell to become fully oxygenated before it leaves the capillary (full equilibration normally happens in 0.25 sec while the red cells spend 0.75 sec in the pulmonary capillaries). Thus, although abnormal diffusion is present in many diseases, diffusion impairment rarely causes hypoxemia. If the individual remains at rest, capillary transit time is slow enough to allow complete equilibration between the alveolar and capillary PO2 even though diffusion is slower. If a patient with impaired diffusion engages in exercise, however, increased cardiac output shortens capillary transit time enough that full equilibration between the alveolar and capillary PO2 may not occur, thereby leading to a fall in the arterial PO2. In the rare cases where diffusion impairment causes hypoxemia, the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased above normal because the capillary PO2 does not equilibrate with the alveolar PO2. Supplemental oxygen administration corrects the hypoxemia due to diffusion impairment by raising the PAO2 and increasing the pressure gradient for diffusion. This increases the likelihood that the capillary PO2 equilibrates with the PAO2 before the red blood cell leaves the pulmonary capillary. Imbalances in Ventilation-Perfusion Matching Perhaps the most important causes of hypoxemia involve imbalances between ventilation and perfusion throughout the lung. Normal Ventilation-Perfusion Matching The lung has structural and feedback mechanisms to ensure that lung units receive an adequate balance of ventilation and perfusion. Well-ventilated areas should receive good blood flow while poorly ventilated regions should receive less blood flow. Note that units that receive low ventilation receive low perfusion while areas that receive high ventilation receive high perfusion. The net result is that the majority of lung units have a ratio of ventilation to perfusion (VA/Q ratio) approaching 1.0. This principle is vital for maintaining normal gas exchange and a normal PaO2. Each circle represents data from a single piece of lung. The dotted lines indicate particular VA/Q ratios. Note that the VA/Q ratio for the majority of lung pieces fall along or near the line for VA/Q = 1. Despite the fact that most lung units have VA/Q ratios near unity, at any given time there are lung units with VA/Q ratios near \"zero\" (virtually unventilated), lung units with ratios of infinity (virtually un-perfused) and a host of lung units with ratios somewhere in between those extremes. One important cause of differences across the lung is gravity. Due to the vertical height of the normal upright lung, blood flow and ventilation are greatest at the bottom of the lung and less at the top of the lung. However, because the differences in perfusion from bottom to top of the lung are greater than the differences in ventilation, average VA/Q ratios change as you move up the lung. At the bottom of the lung, the average VA/Q ratios tend to be lower because perfusion is relatively higher than ventilation, whereas at the top, the average VA/Q ratios tend to be higher because ventilation is greater than perfusion. Other causes of normal variability in VA/Q ratios across the lung include anatomical factors from lung development and active regulation of bronchial and vascular flows. In certain diseases, the scatter of VA/Q ratios around the mean is greater than normal, a phenomenon with major consequences for gas exchange. VA/Q Ratios and Alveolar Gas Partial Pressures (Tensions) Due to variation in VA/Q ratios throughout the lung, the PO2 and PCO2 also vary between lung regions. To understand why, recall that alveolar gas tensions are determined by the balance of influx and efflux of the gas from the alveolus. This principle can be applied to individual alveoli, groups of alveoli or regions of lung. Now consider a lung unit where ventilation decreases and/or perfusion increases, causing the VA/Q ratio to decrease. Because the influx of oxygen is decreased relative to efflux, PAO2 decreases. Similarly, because less CO2 is removed relative to what is delivered to the alveolus by blood flow, PACO2 increases. We can also consider a lung unit where ventilation increases and/or perfusion decreases. This causes the VA/Q ratio to increase. Because more oxygen is brought to the alveolus relative to that taken away, PAO2 increases. Similarly, because more CO2 is taken away relative to what is delivered to the alveolus, PACO2 decreases. We can see from these relationships that those units with a low VA/Q ratio have a low PAO2 and a high PACO2, while units with high VA/Q ratios tend to have an increased PAO2 and decreased PACO2. Alveolar gas partial pressures in dead space units are the same as the inspired values, while in shunt units they are the same as the mixed venous values. Note that low VA/Q units have high PACO2 and low PAO2 while high VA/Q units have low PACO2 and high PAO2. This concept of VA/Q ratios is important, as various diseases cause ventilation- perfusion imbalances (i.e., alterations in VA/Q ratios) that cause hypoxemia. Shunt Shunt, or more appropriately right-to-left shunt is an extreme form of ventilation- perfusion imbalance that causes hypoxemia. The term refers to blood that passes from the systemic venous system to the systemic arterial system without going through gas exchange areas of the lung (in essence, a VA/Q ratio of zero). Why We See Shunt: Aside from the normal shunt, abnormal shunt occur through two general mechanisms: (1) anatomic shunts in which blood bypasses the alveolar-capillary interface of the lung through abnormal pathways for blood flow (e.g., certain forms of congenital heart disease) or abnormal blood vessel collections in the lungs called arteriovenous malformations and (2) processes in which the alveoli are collapsed (atelectasis) or filled with blood, pus, water, protein or cellular material, as might be seen in pneumonia, pulmonary edema or inflammatory lung diseases. Physiologic Effects of Shunt: To understand the effect of shunt on gas exchange, consider Figure 6-8 in which one lung unit is filled with pus but continues to receive half the cardiac output. 50% of the total blood flow (right side) is not exposed to alveolar gas. This results in a large (A-a)ΔO2. In the lung unit on the left, there is full equilibration between the alveolar and capillary PO2. In the lung unit on the right, however, no fresh gas enters the unit and the partial pressure in this unit equilibrates with the mixed venous gas pressure. Therefore, the oxygen content and partial pressure do not change from the mixed venous values as blood moves through that capillary. When the vessels from the two units merge, oxygenated blood from the left side mixes with deoxygenated blood from the right side resulting in a lower PO2 and oxygen content in the systemic circulation. Note that the arterial oxygen content in this figure represents the average of the contents from the left and right lung unit assuming equal blood flow to both units. (The capillary and arterial PO2 values are obtained from the Hb-O2 dissociation curve and do not represent an average). As a result of the pathology on the right side, the patient has a larger (A-a)ΔO2 than normal. Note that the PAO2 used to determine the (A-a)ΔO2 is an idealized number calculated for the entire lung from the ideal alveolar gas equation. How far PaO2 and CaO2 fall when shunt is present depends on how much mixed venous blood travels through shunt regions such as those on the right. In this example, 50% of the blood traveled to the unit on the right. If a smaller percentage (e.g., 30%) traveled to that unit, the PaO2 and CaO2 would be higher than in this example, whereas if a greater percentage traveled to that unit, PaO2 and CaO2 would be lower. The percentage of blood flow that returns to the left side of the heart without traversing a gas-exchanging surface of the lung is referred to as the \"Shunt Fraction.\" It can be calculated using the shunt equation: Hb-O2 dissociation curve to identify the oxygen content that results from the where QQ+ represents flow through shunt regions, QQ, is total blood flow (cardiac output) and QQ+/QQ, denotes the shunt fraction. CcO2 is determined by using the average PAO2 calculated from the ideal alveolar gas equation. QQ+/QQ, is about 5% lower grey channel labeled QQ+ increases, the shunt fraction increases and PaO2 in individuals with normal gas exchange due to blood return to the left side of the heart from the bronchial and Thebesian veins and increases with diseases that cause shunt physiology, such as pneumonia. The concept of the shunt fraction can also be represented graphically (Figure 6-9). Note that as flow through the and CaO2 decrease. The smaller the flow through the lower grey channel, the smaller the shunt fraction and the higher the PaO2 and CaO2. Figure 6-9: Graphical representation of the shunt fraction (A). The bottom grey bar labeled QQ+ represents flow through shunt regions. The thicker the bottom bar (B), the greater the shunt fraction and the lower the PaO2 and CaO2. The thinner the bottom bar (C), the lower the shunt fraction and the higher the PaO2 and CaO2.\\nUnlike in the other causes of hypoxemia described above, hypoxemia due to shunt does not fully resolve with supplemental oxygen. To demonstrate why, consider what happens if the individual breathes an FIO2 of 1.0. The PAO2 increases to ~ 673 in the left lung unit (calculated from the ideal alveolar gas equation). The alveolus on the right is still filled with pus, however, so none of the extra oxygen enters that alveolus. The capillary PO2 on the left equilibrates to the higher value, but the capillary oxygen content of that unit does not increase much because these high PO2 values lie on the flat portion of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve. Hemoglobin is already fully saturated with oxygen and you only add a little dissolved oxygen. The capillary blood on right side continues to have the mixed venous PO2 and oxygen content. When blood from the two sides mix together, the downstream PaO2 and CaO2 remain low (remember to average content, not PO2). PaO2 and CaO2 have increased a little compared to the values breathing air but the (A-a)ΔO2 remains high. This illustrates one of the hallmarks of shunt. In addition to the fact that the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased, administration of supplemental oxygen does not fully correct the PaO2 and CaO2. Note that the PaO2 improves to only a limited extent and the (A-a)ΔO2 remains large. When shunt physiology is present, the magnitude of increase in PaO2 and CaO2 with supplemental oxygen varies based on the shunt fraction. The bigger the shunt fraction, the smaller the response to supplemental oxygen. The greater the shunt fraction, the smaller the change in PaO2 with supplemental oxygen.\\nVentilation-Perfusion Mismatch. Hypoxemia can also develop due to less extreme forms of ventilation-perfusion imbalance than shunt. To understand how this occurs, we must consider two forms of VA/Q mismatch with different effects on gas exchange. Low Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio Units: Lung units where ventilation is low relative to perfusion, referred to as a low VA/Q ratio, are a major cause of hypoxemia. Why We See Low VA/Q Units: Low VA/Q develops any time there is a decrease in ventilation and/or an increase in perfusion. This can occur for one of several reasons. Airway narrowing due to secretions (grey bars) or smooth muscle contraction decreases ventilation of the distal air spaces. The thick black wall of the alveolus represents decreased compliance due to fibrosis. Note that despite a similar transmural pressure at end-inhalation in both lung units, the lung unit on the right is inflated to a lesser degree than the unit on the left. Panel D: Increased perfusion in the absence of a change in ventilation. The black circles represent pulmonary embolus occluding the vessel on top, leading to redistribution of blood flow to the vessel and lung unit on the bottom.\\nNarrowing of the airways due to increased secretions, bronchial smooth muscle contraction. This is commonly seen in asthma and COPD, loss of elastic recoil and decreased tethering of the airways. This is commonly seen in COPD related to emphysema. Regional differences in ventilation due to regional variation in lung compliance. Due to differences in compliance, a given change in pressure yields different changes in volume and, therefore, ventilation between lung units. This can be seen in pulmonary fibrosis. Increased perfusion of a lung unit without a change in ventilation This is the primary mechanism of hypoxemia in pulmonary embolism, whereby occlusion of vessels in a region of lung by the embolus causes diversion of blood flow to other lung units. Physiologic Effects of Low VA/Q: The physiologic effects of low VA/Q are the same whether the problem develops as a result of decreased ventilation, increased perfusion or both. As the VA/Q ratio falls toward 0, the PAO2 and PACO2 progressively approach the mixed venous values (~ 40 mm Hg and 46 mm Hg, respectively). Thus with VA/Q ratios below normal, PAO2 can range from 40 to 100, while the alveolar PACO2 ranges from 40-46. To understand this better, consider Figure 6-13. The lung unit on the right has abnormal ventilation but the alveolus remains open. Perfusion remains normal in this example so this unit has a low VA/Q ratio. Because more oxygen is removed from this alveolus by perfusion than is replaced by ventilation, PAO2 decreases. If diffusion is intact, the capillary PO2 rises to the reduced alveolar level by the time the blood leaves the alveolus. When blood from the capillaries on the left and right mix, PaO2 and CaO2 of the resulting arterial blood is decreased and the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased. How much the (A-a)ΔO2 increases is a function of the VA/Q ratio and the amount of lung involved. The lower the ratio, the larger the (A-a)ΔO2. The VA/Q ratio has been arbitrarily chosen to result in a PAO2 of 50 mm Hg. Blood flow to the two alveoli is the same. The FIO2 is 0.21 Low VA/Q units respond differently to supplemental oxygen administration than shunt units, a phenomenon with important implications for patient care. This is demonstrated in Figure 6-14, where the patient has been put on supplemental oxygen sufficient to raise the PIO2 to 285 mm Hg.\\nNote the larger increase in PaO2 and CaO2 when compared to supplemental oxygen administration in a patient with shunt. The PAO2 in the unit on the left rises, as does the capillary PO2 and oxygen content. In the abnormal unit on the right, the PAO2 rises but not as much as on the other side. Full equilibration occurs and the capillary PO2 rises to this lower alveolar value. When the capillary blood from the two sides mix together, the resultant arterial blood has a lower PaO2 and CaO2 than if both sides were normal and we will still calculate an increased (A-a)ΔO2. However, because the capillary blood in the low VA/Q units can acquire extra oxygen, PaO2 and CaO2 are higher following supplemental oxygen administration than they would be if the abnormal unit was a shunt unit. This is one reason we can readily improve oxygenation when patients present with COPD exacerbations, characterized mainly by low VA/Q, as opposed to patients with pneumonia, where shunt physiology plays the larger role in causing hypoxemia. High Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio Units: High VA/Q units develop if an alveolus is under-perfused relative to the ventilation it receives. If there is no perfusion the ratio is infinity and we refer to it as \"dead-space\" because no O2 can be removed or CO2 added. Why We See High VA/Q Units: High VA/Q develops any time there is an increase in ventilation and/or a decrease in perfusion. A classic example of this is a pulmonary embolism which occludes a pulmonary artery or arteriole, thereby preventing perfusion of the downstream alveolar units. This can also be seen as a result of processes that destroy or thrombose the pulmonary capillary bed or regional differences in ventilation due to differences in compliance across the lung. Physiologic Effects of High VA/Q Units: The physiologic effects of high VA/Q are the same whether the problem develops as a result of increased ventilation, decreased perfusion or both. In dead space units, the PO2 in that alveolus is the same as the inspired PO2 (150 mm Hg) while the PCO2 is nearly zero. With less severe under-perfusion or over-ventilation the VA/Q ratio rises toward infinity and the alveolar gas values approach inspired gas (PO2 = 150, PCO2 = 0). High VA/Q units do not actually cause hypoxemia and even tend to increase PaO2. To see why this is the case, consider. Notice that the alveolus in the abnormal unit on the right has less perfusion but the same ventilation as the unit on the left. This leads to a PO2 higher than the 100 mm Hg in the unit on the right because less oxygen is removed per unit time due to the decrease in perfusion.\\nThe capillary PO2 on the abnormal side rises to a higher level but the capillary oxygen content does not increase much because hemoglobin is completely saturated (the PO2 falls on the flat portion of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve). The impact of high VA/Q units on arterial oxygenation is also limited because the reduced blood flow from these alveoli is greatly outweighed by the higher blood flow from an equal number of normal alveoli. Blood flow is reduced on the right. In the high VA/Q alveolus, PAO2 is increased and PACO2 is decreased. Even though CcO2 is increased on the right, CaO2 does not rise significantly because of the differences in blood flow from the two sides when mixing occurs. The Impact of Ventilation Perfusion Heterogeneity While high VA/Q units alone do not cause hypoxemia, any disease that causes a mixture of high and low VA/Q areas leads to hypoxemia. On the surface this would seem unlikely, as one might expect high VA/Q units to compensate for problems caused by low VA/Q units. In fact, this is not the case; high VA/Q units cannot make up for hypoxemia caused by low VA/Q units and any increase in VA/Q heterogeneity leads to hypoxemia. Why is this the case? Even though high VA/Q regions are associated with a higher PO2, the shape of the Hb-O2 curve means that little O2 content is added as the PO2 increases above 100 because the hemoglobin is already fully saturated with oxygen. As a result, the blood from these high VA/Q units cannot compensate for the drop in oxygen content caused by low VA/Q areas. In addition there is often less blood coming from high VA/Q units than from an equal number of low VA/Q units. As a result, when mixing occurs in the left atrium, the low VA/Q units make a greater contribution to the total oxygen content of the blood. Thus any process that results in both high and low VA/Q areas results in inefficient oxygen exchange and an increased (A-a)ΔO2. An example of this phenomenon is the hypoxemia that develops following pulmonary embolism, blockage of a pulmonary artery by a thrombus that formed in an extremity vein and traveled to the pulmonary vasculature. The lung unit where the thrombus lodges has a high VA/Q ratio because the thrombus decreases blood flow to that unit. In and of itself, this should not cause hypoxemia but because all of the cardiac output must go through the lung, blood that cannot get through the area blocked by the embolus is diverted to other areas of the lung, thereby lowering their VA/Q ratios. Now there are areas of both high and low VA/Q ratios. This VA/Q heterogeneity causes hypoxemia. While abnormal VA/Q interfere with CO2 elimination, hypercarbia is not commonly seen in such patients. This is because the normal response to a rising PaCO2 is to increase minute ventilation. Due to the shape of the CO2 content vsPCO2 relationship, increased ventilation efficiently removes CO2 from both high and low VA/Q areas bringing PaCO2 back to normal. Because the slope of this relationship is steep in the physiologic range over which the PCO2 varies in health and disease, small changes in the PCO2 with increasing ventilation lead to large decreases in CO2 content. In addition, because the relationship between the PCO2 and CO2 content is linear in the physiologic range, high VA/Q units can compensate for problems caused by low VA/Q units. Any decrease in the PCO2 is accompanied by a decrease on CO2 content. This is in contrast to the situation with oxygen where high VA/Q units are unable to compensate for the hypoxemia caused by low VA/Q units. Even though the increase in ventilation raises PAO2, because the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve flattens when the PO2 is above 90-100 mm Hg, further increases in the PO2 in high VA/Q units fail to increase the oxygen content of the blood coming out of those units. Note: It is incorrect to say that the PaO2 \"does not increase\" with supplemental oxygen in shunt. The bigger the shunt fraction, the smaller the response to supplemental oxygen.\\nThe physiologic response to hypoxemia. Hypoxemia triggers a series of physiologic responses that may improve the alveolar and arterial PO2 as well as oxygen content, thereby helping to preserve oxygen delivery to the tissues. One of these responses (hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction) is particularly important in light of the role that ventilation-perfusion matching plays in gas exchange. Decreases in the alveolar PO2 cause the pulmonary vasculature in the area to constrict, thereby decreasing blood flow to that lung unit. By decreasing blood flow to the unit, HPV ensures adequate ventilation-perfusion matching, which helps preserve blood oxygenation.\\nDetermining the cause of hypoxemia. It is helpful to determine which of the five mechanisms is causing hypoxemia in a given patient as, along with other clinical information, this can be used to generate a differential diagnosis and guide management. The following simple algorithm, which requires arterial blood gas data, can be used for this purpose.\\nAlgorithm for determining the cause of hypoxemia. Step 1: Is the Patient at High Altitude or Breathing a Low FIO2? If yes, then low PIO2 is at least one contributing cause. Information about altitude will be provided in cases during this course when relevant. Step 2: Is the Patient Hypoventilating? If the PaCO2 is > 45 mm Hg, then hypoventilation is at least one contributing cause. Step 3: Is the (A-a)ΔO2 Increased or Normal? To determine this, subtract the PaO2 from the PAO2, which is calculated from the ideal alveolar gas equation. An increased (A-a)ΔO2 indicates that shunt or VA/Q mismatch is contributing to hypoxemia. Diffusion impairment can also increase the (A-a)ΔO2, but it is such an uncommon cause of hypoxemia that it is generally not considered on the differential diagnosis in this algorithm. If a patient has hypoventilation and a normal (A-a)ΔO2, then hypoventilation is the only cause of their hypoxemia. If, hypoventilation is present and the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased, then there is another process - either shunt or VA/Q mismatch - contributing to their hypoxemia. Step 4: What Is the Response to Supplemental Oxygen? The goal of this step is to differentiate between shunt and VA/Q mismatch as the cause of hypoxemia. Technically, one needs examine the response to breathing an FIO2 of 1.0 to make this distinction as the (A-a)ΔO2 completely normalizes when a patient with VA/Q mismatch breathes this oxygen concentration but remains elevated in the setting of shunt. This is rarely done in clinical practice and one will, instead, make an estimate based on the response to lesser amounts of oxygen. If the response to supplemental oxygen is large, then VA/Q mismatch is playing the larger role but if the response is small then we attribute more of the problem to shunt. In many clinical situations, patients have a mix of VA/Q mismatch and shunt and it can be hard to identify the primary process. An Example of the How to Use the Algorithm The Case: A 6 year-old boy is found floating face down in a swimming pool. After being removed from the pool and resuscitated, he is transported to the emergency department of a hospital at sea level where an arterial blood gas shows a PaCO2 of 51 mm Hg and a PaO2 of 48 mm Hg. He is intubated and placed on a ventilator with an FIO2 of 1.0. A repeat arterial blood gas shows a PaO2 of 66 mm Hg. What is the cause of his hypoxemia? The Solution: Using the steps outlined above, we see the following: Step 1: The patient is not at high altitude. Low PIO2 is not a contributing factor. Step 2: The increased PaCO2 indicates that hypoventilation is contributing to his hypoxemia. Step 3: The initial (A-a)ΔO2 (calculated from the alveolar gas equation) is 38 mm Hg, indicating that there is an additional cause of hypoxemia beyond hypoventilation (shunt and/or low VA/Q). Step 4: When he is breathing an FIO2 of 1.0, the PaO2 did not rise much and there is still a large (A-a)ΔO2. As a result, he has a large shunt contributing to the hypoxemia. This was due to the alveolar edema from drowning.\\nThe pediatric perspective on hypoxemia. The pathophysiology described in this chapter is the same in pediatric patients as in adults. Infants, however, are more prone than adults to rapid development of hypoxemia in the setting of respiratory compromise. Because of their higher metabolic activity and oxygen consumption requirements, oxygen efflux from the alveoli is increased relative to that seen in adults. As a result, with any impairment in ventilation of a given alveolar unit, the PAO2 will quickly decrease, thereby setting the stage for a rapid decrease in the PaO2. Appendix: The Pulse Oximeter and Health Disparities Pulse oximetry is one of the key tools for identifying hypoxemia when individuals first present for evaluation and is the primary means of monitoring oxygen saturation on an ongoing basis in various clinical settings (emergency department, operating room, acute care wards, intensive care unit). As noted earlier in this chapter, the pulse oximeter uses an internal algorithm to convert a measured pattern of light absorption into an estimate of the arterial oxygen saturation. These algorithms were developed on the basis of studies done in healthy volunteers, the majority of whom were light-skinned. Despite this, the devices have been used on a widespread basis in all patient populations. After concerns were raised about the accuracy of these devices in Black patients, a group of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco conducted a systematic study of this question and determined that when the estimated oxygen saturation obtained by pulse oximetry was compared to the true saturation measured by co-oximetry in Black individuals, the pulse oximeter tended to overestimate the true oxygen saturation. The errors were greatest at lower oxygen saturation values, although the accuracy of all pulse oximeters declines as the true oxygen saturation falls in all patients. Such errors are thought to occur with non-Black populations with increased skin pigmentation, although the magnitude of error is less in lightly pigmented individuals. Further strong evidence for systematic problems with pulse oximetry was provided in a research letter recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine from investigators at the University of Michigan. They compared estimates of oxygen saturation obtained by pulse oximetry with the true oxygen saturation as measured by co-oximetry on an arterial blood gas sample in two large cohorts of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and found that Black patients had nearly three times the frequency of occult hypoxemia not detected by pulse oximetry as White patients. In other words, the pulse oximeter was more likely to overestimate the true saturation in Black patients than in White Patients. Because pulse oximetry is a key part of home monitoring programs and triage decisions during the pandemic and guides decisions about adjusting supplemental oxygen administration in COVID-19 and a myriad of other clinical situations, these problems with pulse oximetry may place Black patients and other individuals with increased skin pigmentation at increased risk for severe hypoxemia and its associated consequences. Despite this concern about pulse oximeters, device manufacturers have not done sufficient work to address the effect of skin pigmentation as they continue to develop and refine subsequent generations of these systems. Until such changes are made, one way to monitor for this problem in the hospital is to obtain a blood gas sample on patients with increased skin pigmentation who present with COVID-19 or other causes of hypoxemia and perform co-oximetry to determine the true arterial oxygen saturation. This information can then be used to identify cases where the pulse oximeter is overestimating the true saturation and thereby alter monitoring practices accordingly.\\nPulmonary Function Testing (PFT) is one of the core diagnostic tools in respiratory medicine. Several tests are used to provide a reproducible and highly accurate assessment of the functional status of the respiratory system that is helpful for a variety of purposes, the most important of which is identification of the cause of chronic dyspnea. This chapter describes the indications for pulmonary function testing and the available tests and outlines an approach to test interpretation. List the indications for performing pulmonary function testing. Describe the information derived from the basic pulmonary function tests. Describe the manner in which test results are labeled as normal or abnormal. Outline an approach to interpreting a set of pulmonary function tests. Characterize the pattern of abnormality in a set of pulmonary function tests. You will gain experience in pulmonary function test interpretation during the inclass session that serves as a companion to this chapter and during coverage of various clinical diseases in the small group sessions throughout the pulmonary component of the course.\\nThe history of pulmonary function testing. As discussed further below, the most commonly used and most important pulmonary function test is the forced expiratory volume maneuver, which is performed using a device known as a spirometer. Credit for the development of the spirometer in the 1840s is usually given to John Hutchinson, an English surgeon, although others including the Czech experimentalist Johannes Purkinje and another English physician Charles Turner Thackrah developed and used different versions of the spirometer for various studies before Hutchinson. The spirometer was introduced in the United States in the mid-19th century but it was not until the middle of the 20th century, when two critical parameters, the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the ratio of the FEV1 to the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) were first described, that pulmonary function testing played an increasing role in diagnosis and monitoring of individuals with pulmonary diseases. In subsequent years, lung volume and diffusion capacity measurements entered clinical practice, further expanding the utility of pulmonary function testing. Despite its current valuable role in pulmonary medicine, the early history of the spirometer is quite problematic, as the spirometer played a role in propagating systemic racism. The first person to use the spirometer in the U.S was a plantation physician and slaveholder named Samuel Cartwright who built his own device to study lung capacity differences between the Whites and slaves. He defined the lower values observed in slaves as \"deficiencies\" and used this and other information he gathered to suggest that the physical and mental \"deficiencies\" of Black people made them ill-suited for liberty. Of note, these claims were similar to those made earlier by former president Thomas Jefferson who claimed that differences in the structure of the respiratory system between the whites and Black people were one of several differences in physical development that justified the position of the Black people in society. Following the Civil War, a large anthropometric survey of Black and White soldiers led by Benjamin Apthorp Gould reported that Black soldiers had lower lung capacity than White counterparts. Importantly it failed to adjust for factors such as age, height and, importantly, the living and working conditions of the recently emancipated slaves. It was also limited by major logistical problems including the fact that it was conducted amidst the civil war by overworked examiners often using faulty equipment. Despite these problems, the data from this and other studies became the basis for long-held beliefs that lung capacity differed between Black and White people, with often detrimental consequences. Drawing on the results of this and other studies, individuals including the historian Charles Gayaree and prominent insurance statistician Frederick Hoffman argued that deficiencies in lung function might lead to the extinction of Black people. Hoffman, in particular, argued that by living under artificial conditions, Black people were protected from the \"struggles for existence\" during slavery. With emancipation, they were now destined for extinction, in part due to their purported inferior lung function, and no amount of philanthropy, education or favorable treatment could reverse that trend. While there were voices, such as the War Department\\'s chief medical officer Jedediah Baxter or Black intellectuals such as Kelly Miller and W.E.B Dubois, who provided statistical evidence and other arguments to counter these claims, the notion of racial and ethnic differences in pulmonary function took hold with subsequent influence on efforts to limit political, economic and social equality. Additional resources on this sordid history are provided at the end of the chapter.\\nIndications for pulmonary function testing. Pulmonary function tests are used for a variety of purposes. Evaluation of Chronic Dyspnea When patients present with chronic dyspnea, PFTs can be used to identify the primary functional abnormality, such as whether they have problems with obstruction to airflow or problems expanding their respiratory system (referred to as \"restriction.\") This information is then used to generate a differential diagnosis for the patient\\'s problem and guide further evaluation and management. In addition to characterizing the functional abnormality, PFTs can also accurately characterize the severity of the problem and provide information to assess disability. It should be noted that PFTs are used for the evaluation of chronic dyspnea (weeks to years of symptoms) and have no role in the evaluation of acute dyspnea (symptoms that develop suddenly or over several hours). Monitor Disease Progression and Response to Therapy Because PFTs are accurate and highly reproducible, they are used to follow disease progression. For example, when patients are started on therapy for diffuse parenchymal lung disease, PFTs can be monitored to assess the response to therapy. Similarly, patients who have undergone lung transplantation undergo PFTs at specified intervals, as changes in pulmonary function are one of the first indications of transplant rejection or new infection. Patients undergoing lung resection as part of lung cancer management undergo pre-operative testing to determine the degree of lung resection they can tolerate, including resection of an entire lung (pneumonectomy), resection of a single lobe (lobectomy) or resection of a smaller portion of a lobe (wedge resection). Patients with poor pre-operative tolerate a pneumonectomy or lobectomy because they would be left with insufficient pulmonary function post-operatively. PFTs were formerly used extensively to help predict the risk of post-operative pulmonary complications for a variety of surgeries (eg coronary artery bypass surgery) but use for this purpose has declined due to lack of data demonstrating a benefit from this practice. Utility in Children PFTs require careful coaching on the part of the pulmonary function technician and an ability to follow directions on the part of the patient, and, as a result, can be challenging to perform in young children. Although pediatric pulmonary physicians may start getting PFTs in children for the purposes described above around 5-6 years of age, reliable results can generally only be obtained once children reach 8-9 years of age.\\nTests of pulmonary function. There are several core pulmonary function tests that provide information about airflow, lung volumes and the surface area for gas exchange. Spirometry Spirometry is the most commonly performed pulmonary function test. Unlike many of the other tests that must be performed in a specialized pulmonary function laboratory, spirometry can be performed in outpatient primary care clinics. The test is more formally known as a forced expiratory volume maneuver and is the primary tool for assessing the adequacy of airflow. How the Test Is Performed In this maneuver, an individual seals their lips around a mouthpiece while wearing nose clips to ensure that all expiratory and inspiratory airflow goes through the mouthpiece. They then perform normal \"tidal (i.e., resting) breathing\" in and out through the mouthpiece. The volume of air they bring in and out with each breath during tidal breathing is referred to as the tidal volume (TV or VT) and the amount of air left in their lungs after exhalation during tidal breathing is referred to as functional residual capacity (FRC). The individual is then asked to take as deep a breath as they can, inflating their lungs to total lung capacity (TLC) and then exhale until no more air can be pushed out. The lungs are not devoid of air at this point as a volume of air, the residual volume (RV), is left in the lungs following the complete exhalation. In normal individuals, the forced exhalation typically lasts 6 seconds but in patients with airflow obstruction exhalation can last much longer. The full exhalation from TLC to RV can be done slowly, but to measure maximal airflow capability, the maneuver is done with a forceful exhalation. The various components of this breathing maneuver and the other subdivisions of lung volume are depicted in what known as a spirogram. Note that even though FRC, RV and TLC are represented on this spirogram, they cannot be measured by spirometry and, instead, can only be measured using other tests (discussed below). The data from spirometry are typically presented in two formats: (1) exhaled volume as a function of time and; (2) flow as a function of exhaled volume, referred to as a flow-volume loop. The data in these figures are obtained from the same expiratory maneuver but emphasize different aspects of the same information. There are several things to note about the data in these figures. In the volume versus time curve it is apparent that in normal individuals, the bulk of the exhaled volume comes out in the first second of the forced exhalation. In the flow versus volume curve, it should be apparent that expiratory flow quickly rises to a peak value (peak expiratory flow) before declining over the rest of exhalation. Data Obtained from Spirometry Several data points are obtained from spirometry: Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1): The volume exhaled in the first second of exhalation. Vital Capacity (VC): This is the total volume exhaled and represents the difference between TLC and RV.When this value is obtained from a forced exhalation maneuver it is called the Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). It can also be measured during slow exhalation in which case is it called the Slow Vital Capacity (SVC). FEV1/VC Ratio: The ratio is expressed either as a percentage (e.g., 78%) or a decimal (e.g., 0.78). In normal individuals, because most volume comes out in the first second, this value is typically above 70% or 0.7. When patients have problems with airflow obstruction, less volume comes out in the first second relative to the total exhaled volume and the ratio decreases. Peak Expiratory Flow Rate: The maximum flow rate obtained on exhalation. This is displayed on the flow-volume loop. This data point can also be measured using simple hand-held devices, as is often done in patients with asthma who monitor their own disease activity, but these readings are less accurate than spirometry. Lung Volumes Spirometry primarily provides information about airflow. Lung volume measurements allow more complete characterization of the patient\\'s functional abnormality. How Lung Volumes Are Measured Lung volumes can be measured using one of three different methods including body plethysmography, helium dilution and nitrogen washout techniques. The details of how each test is performed are beyond the scope of what you need to know at this stage of your training. In most patients, the different methods yield similar values for each measured parameter. In patients with severe obstructive lung disease, however, discrepancies can emerge between the different tests. Data Obtained from Lung Volume Measurements Several data points are obtained from lung volume measurements: Total Lung Capacity (TLC): the maximum volume to which an individual can inhale. Residual Volume (RV): the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of a maximal exhalation. When this value is increased above normal, it indicates that the individual is trapping air behind prematurely closing airways. Functional Residual Capacity (FRC): the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of a tidal exhalation. This, as noted earlier in the course, is the point at which the tendency of the lungs to recoil to a lower volume is balanced by the tendency of the chest to recoil out to a higher volume. Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) The Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) provides information about the capacity to transfer gas across the alveolar-capillary barrier, which, as noted earlier in the course, occurs by passive diffusion. How the Test is Performed An individual begins with resting breathing and then exhales to residual volume. At this point, they take a maximum inhalation to total lung capacity with a test gas containing a trace amount of carbon monoxide. They then hold their breath for 10 seconds during which time carbon monoxide rapidly diffuses across the alveolar- capillary barrier and is taken up by circulating red blood cells in the pulmonary capillaries. The individual then exhales quickly. The initial exhaled gas, representing the gas from anatomic dead space, is discarded and a sample of the subsequent exhaled gas, representing alveolar gas, is collected. The change in carbon monoxide concentration between the inhaled gas and the collected exhaled gas is then used to determine how much carbon monoxide was transferred from the alveoli into the blood. Carbon monoxide is used for this test because it has such high affinity for hemoglobin that it does not accumulate on the capillary side of the barrier (i.e., there is no back pressure to diffusion). The amount of carbon monoxide taken up by the blood reflects how much surface area is available for gas exchange. Information Obtained from The Diffusion Capacity Measurement The DLCO maneuver (units are mL/min/mm Hg) provides information about the surface area available for gas exchange. Any disease that impairs the surface area for gas exchange causes a decrease in this parameter. This can happen in emphysema, for example, where enlargement of the alveolar spaces decreases the alveolar capillary surface area or in pulmonary fibrosis when the alveolar- capillary barrier is abnormally thickened. Although diffusion is often thought of as being a function of alveolar membrane surface area and thickness, the dominant factor is usually the capillary blood volume, which influences both the surface area available for exchange and the volume of blood available to accept carbon monoxide. A decrease in the hemoglobin concentration (anemia) decreases uptake of carbon monoxide across the barrier during the test, leading to a low measured value that is not truly reflective of the alveolar-capillary surface area or thickness. For this reason, the measured value the measured hemoglobin concentration. Diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension that lead to a decrease in the number of pulmonary capillaries (referred to as \"pruning of the vascular tree\") can also decrease the measured value. Additional Testing Maneuvers Depending on the clinical circumstances, additional testing maneuvers can be performed to further characterize the patient\\'s functional abnormality. Spirometry can be following administration of a short-acting bronchodilator, such as albuterol. The change in the FEV1 and FVC from the pre- bronchodilator values are noted both in terms of the absolute and percent change. An adult patient is deemed to have a positive bronchodilator response if either the FEV1 or FVC improves by 200 mL and 12% from the pre- bronchodilator value. In children, a bronchodilator response is deemed to be present if there is a 12% change in the FEV1 only. FVC is not considered, nor is there an absolute volume cut-off. Such a response is sometimes seen in patients with obstruction to airflow on exhalation and indicates that they have an element of \"reversibility\" to their obstruction (i.e., the defect is not fixed). Upright and Supine Spirometry When concern is raised for diaphragmatic paralysis, spirometry is performed in the upright and supine position. When the patient is supine, the abdominal contents move up towards the chest and press on the diaphragm. In healthy individuals, the functional diaphragm can push against these contents and descend into the abdomen even when supine. The individual can take as deep a breath as normal and has a relatively unchanged vital capacity. In individuals with diaphragmatic paralysis, however, the weakened diaphragm cannot push against the abdominal contents when the effect of gravity has been removed. Inhalation is limited and vital capacity is reduced. A reduction of vital capacity of > 20% in the supine position compared to the upright value is consistent with diaphragmatic weakness. Maximum Inspiratory and Expiratory Pressures When concern is raised for a neuromuscular problem, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP) can be measured to assess muscle strength. The precise technique for this measurement is beyond the scope of what you need to know for this course. Decrements in either MIP or MEP suggest that a neuromuscular problem is contributing to the patient\\'s functional abnormality.\\nInterpreting pulmonary function tests. Once tests have been performed and deemed satisfactory, the next goal is to interpret the results and determine the functional abnormality and the severity of the problem. What Constitutes Normal? The FEV1/FVC ratio is categorized as normal or abnormal based on the absolute ratio. There is debate about how to properly define the lower limit of normal for this ratio that is beyond the scope of this course. For the purposes of this class, we will define the lower limit of normal for the ratio in adults as 0.7. In children up to 12 years of age, the lower limit of normal is 0.85, while in children 13 and up, a lower limit of normal of 0.8 is often used. For most of the other parameters in pulmonary function testing, a measurement is not designated as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\" based on the absolute measured value. Instead, this designation is made based on how the measured value compares to the predicted value for that patient. Measured values less than or greater than a certain percentage of the predicted value are labeled as abnormal. The normal values for a patient are obtained from prediction equations derived large, healthy populations and are based largely on the individual\\'s age, sex and height. For individuals who are not cis-gender, it is standard practice to use the sex designated at birth. When interpreting tests, it is important to ask how the predicted values were determined and consider whether the data set from which that prediction equation was derived applies to your patient. Based on the historical studies described earlier and a large number of subsequent studies reporting differences in lung capacity between White and other racial and ethnic groups, race and ethnicity have long been considered variables that warrant attention when determining the predicted values. This notion has persisted despite the fact that race is a social construct which should not predict physiologic measures, as well as the fact that many of these studies failed to define race and/or ethnicity adequately. Genetic factors undoubtedly influence lung function but this should not be confused with race. Up until about 2005, there were two approaches to determining the predicted values for different racial and ethnic groups in pulmonary function laboratories The first was to simply adjust the predicted values from data sets derived from studies of white individuals by a fixed correction factor. The second was to use race- and ethnic-specific reference standards derived from population studies of those groups. The first approach was clearly inappropriate and has since been abandoned. Current guidelines continue to recommend use of race- and ethnicity-specific standards with self-identification used to determine race or ethnicity. With increasing global migration and the increasing diversity of the population, however, it can be challenging to find data sets and prediction equations suitable for all patients who may be undergo testing in a particular pulmonary function laboratory. The data sets also fail to account for the issues of mixed race and/or ethnicity. The Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) is a recent effort to collect respiratory function information from around the world in an effort to generate prediction equations that appropriately account for the diversity of the people being tested. There is, however, growing interest in discarding race in establishing predicted values. By way of example, in September of 2020, the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means in the U.S.House of Representatives sent a letter to the leadership of the American Thoracic Society specifically inquiring about the Society\\'s efforts to reevaluate the use of race in pulmonary function testing. At the time this chapter was written, the leadership had yet to respond to the Chairman\\'s letter. The issue of correcting for race and ethnicity has had implications outside the clinical setting and the usual efforts to diagnose and monitor lung disease. When faced with lawsuits regarding its production of asbestos, the chemical company Owens Corning drew on long-standing and disputed beliefs regarding decreased pulmonary function in Black people and argued that Black people would need to demonstrate lower scores on pulmonary function tests than whites to prove that asbestos caused their lung disease. Reversing an earlier ruling he had made allowing for race and ethnicity-based adjustments of pulmonary function results, in 1999 a Baltimore circuit court judge denied the company\\'s claim and invalidated the use of race correction in these lawsuits. The Primary Functional Abnormalities The main goal of PFT interpretation is to determine the patient\\'s primary functional abnormality, as this guides further evaluation and management. There are three major functional abnormalities that can be identified on pulmonary function testing. Obstructive Diseases The primary functional abnormality in this category is obstruction to airflow, most typically on exhalation. In other words, there is some problem affecting airway function that decreases expiratory airflow. The diagnostic hallmark of diseases in this category is a low FEV1/FVC ratio. Diseases with Restrictive Pathophysiology The primary functional abnormality in this category is limitation in the ability of the respiratory system to expand adequately on inhalation. The diagnostic hallmark of these diseases is a decreased TLC. Two broad sets of problems cause restrictive pathophysiology: Intrapulmonary disease: A disease affects the lung parenchyma, making it difficult to expand the lung on inhalation. An example is pulmonary fibrosis. Extrapulmonary disease: Some problem outside the lungs, such as a deformed chest wall cavity or neuromuscular disease, limits the ability to expand the lung on inhalation. The underlying lung parenchyma is normal. Examples include diaphragmatic paralysis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Pulmonary Vascular Diseases The primary functional abnormality in this category is a problem with the pulmonary vasculature that decreases blood flow through the pulmonary capillary network. Airflow and lung volumes are usually normal and the main abnormality observed on pulmonary function testing is a low DLCO. An example is pulmonary arterial hypertension. The remainder of this chapter is focused on test interpretation and determining the category in which a patient falls. Further information on the specific diseases that cause each functional abnormality is covered later in the course. Algorithm for Pulmonary Function Test Interpretation As with interpretation of electrocardiograms and chest radiographs, a systematic approach is important when interpreting pulmonary function tests. An algorithm for test interpretation is outlined below. Before you interpret any numerical data, it is important to ensure the tests yielded valid data. You should check the comments from the pulmonary function technologist who performed the test to ensure the patient gave a good effort, was able to follow instructions properly and the test maneuvers met official criteria for what is referred to as \"acceptability.\" All conclusions must be tempered significantly when the test data do not meet acceptability criteria.\\nStep-wise Algorithm for Interpreting Pulmonary Function Tests. Step 1: Check Spirometry The first variable to assess is the FEV1/FVC ratio, which provides information about airflow on exhalation. If the value is below the lower limit of normal, the patient is deemed to have to have an obstructive ventilatory impairment (i.e., an obstructive pattern). While this is often due to asthma or COPD, other diseases can cause airflow obstruction as well. If the ratio is normal, the patient could have normal lung function or another functional abnormality, such as a restrictive or pulmonary vascular pattern. The FVC provides further information about this, as will subsequent tests you assess. Step 2: Check Lung Volumes (TLC) If the total lung capacity is low, the patient is deemed to have a restrictive ventilatory impairment (i.e., a restrictive pattern). In patients with obstructive lung diseases, lung volumes provide further information to characterize their respiratory mechanics. An increased TLC indicates they have \"hyperinflation\" (i.e., very large lung volumes) while a high RV indicates they have \"air-trapping,\" due to premature airway closure on exhalation that prevents complete emptying of their lungs. This is discussed further in Chapter 9 on obstructive lung diseases. Step 3: Check the Diffusion Capacity for Carbon Monoxide (DLCO) The DLCO provides information about the ability to transfer gases across the alveolar-capillary barrier and is reflective of the adequacy of the surface area available for gas exchange. The utility of the measurement in test interpretation varies based on the pattern of results seen in other components of the pulmonary function testing. Restrictive Pattern with Low DLCO: As noted above, restrictive pathophysiology can be seen with intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary problems. Because it indicates an abnormal surface area for gas exchange, the low DLCO suggests the restrictive pathophysiology is due to an intrapulmonary process, such as pulmonary fibrosis. Obstructive Pattern with Low DLCO: This pattern suggests that airflow obstruction is related to emphysema, which causes destruction of normal alveolar architecture, leading to enlarged airspaces and decreased surface area for gas exchange. A low DLCO should not be seen in asthma as that disease affects the airways alone and does not affect the alveolar space. Normal Spirometry and Lung Volumes with Low DLCO: This pattern is suggestive of a pulmonary vascular problem such as pulmonary arterial hypertension or an arteriovenous malformation (Chapter 13). The low DLCO occurs because such disorders can decrease the volume of blood flowing by the alveolar-capillary barrier throughout the lung, which impairs the ability to transfer gases across that barrier. identifying the flow-volume the primary function and Step 4: Check the Flow-Volume Loops In the majority of cases, the numerical data alone are sufficient for evaluating pulmonary functional abnormality. Occasionally, however, loop provides additional useful information beyond that seen in the numerical data. The flow-volume loop often takes on a characteristic appearance depending on the primary functional abnormality (Figure 7-4). Such patterns are not present in all patients with these functional abnormalities but tend to be more prominent with severe functional defects. There can also be variations in appearance between individuals with a particular functional defect. In rare circumstances, an obstructive functional defect is due to a lesion or structural problem causing obstruction in the upper airways (trachea, proximal mainstem bronchi) rather than the more common causes of such functional defects, asthma or COPD, where the obstruction to airflow is in the more distal airways. In these cases, the flow-volume loop provides the key information that facilitates diagnosis of the problem. In obstructive processes, peak expiratory flow is decreased and the expiratory limb of the curve has a \"scooped out\" appearance due to different rates emptying across lung units. In restrictive processes, peak expiratory flow is normal while the total volume exhaled (vital capacity, represented as movement along the x-axis) is low. Variable intrathoracic obstruction causes flattening of the expiratory portion of the loop while variable extrathoracic obstruction causes flattening of the inspiratory portion. In fixed upper airway obstruction, the lumen of the airway does not vary in size during the respiratory cycle and both limbs of the flow volume loop are flattened. Variable Intrathoracic Obstruction: A lesion is located in the airways inside the thoracic cavity and the extent of obstruction varies with airway pressure changes during the respiratory cycle. Airway collapse occurs on exhalation as pleural pressure rises above airway pressure and decreases transmural pressure at the point of obstruction. Airflow on inhalation is normal because the decrease in pleural pressure on inhalation pulls the airways open. The expiratory limb of the flow volume loop is flat. An example of this problem is tracheomalacia, which involves destruction of the cartilaginous rings that support the airway walls and normally prevent collapse on exhalation.\\nAre lesion is located in the airways outside the thoracic cavity and the extent of obstruction varies with airway pressure changes during the respiratory cycle. Airway collapse occurs on inhalation as airway pressure falls below atmospheric pressure surrounding the extrathoracic trachea. Airflow on exhalation is normal because airway pressure is positive and greater than the atmospheric pressure. The inspiratory limb of the flow volume loop is flat. An example is a thyroid mass. Fixed Upper Airway Obstruction: The lesion can be in the airways inside or outside the thoracic cavity and the effect on cross sectional area of the airway does not vary during the respiratory cycle due to the severity of the obstruction. The expiratory and inspiratory limbs of the flow volume loops are both flattened. An example is compression of the trachea by surrounding lymphadenopathy. Grading Severity of Observed Abnormalities In addition to identifying the primary functional abnormality, another goal of test interpretation is to grade the severity of the observed defect. The severity of obstructive and restrictive ventilatory defects are graded from mild to very severe based on the decrement in the FEV1. The specific thresholds used to label defects as mild, moderate, severe or very severe are beyond the scope of this course. FOLLOWING UP TEST RESULTS Pulmonary function test results provide a guide for further evaluation and management. The appropriate follow-up steps vary based on the pattern seen on the tests and the original indications for testing. Airway inspection may be done by laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy.\\nDefect When the diagnosis of asthma or COPD is suspected and pulmonary function tests demonstrates airflow obstruction, further diagnostic testing is usually not necessary, and management can be initiated toward their particular diagnosis and its associated clinical features. When a diagnosis of asthma is suspected but the initial pulmonary function tests do not provide clear support for the diagnosis, patients are referred for additional diagnostic tests, such as methacholine challenge testing. If the flow volume loop demonstrates a pattern consistent with an upper airway obstruction, the patient should be referred for a CT scan of the head and neck and, depending on the results, flexible laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy for upper airway inspection. Restrictive Ventilatory Defect The appropriate follow-up for this group of problems is based on whether the restrictive defect is due to an intra- or extrapulmonary process. When suspicion is raised for an intrapulmonary process, the next diagnostic step is a high resolution Chest CT scan to obtain detailed images of the lung parenchyma. When pulmonary function testing suggests the patient has an extrapulmonary problem, patients typically undergo supine and upright spirometry to evaluate diaphragm function and measurement of maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures to evaluate for muscle weakness. Additional testing beyond that performed in the pulmonary function laboratory may also be necessary. Isolated Decrease in Diffusion Capacity A decreased DLCO in conjunction with normal spirometry and lung volumes raises suspicion for a pulmonary vascular process such as pulmonary hypertension. The most appropriate next step is an echocardiogram to estimate pulmonary artery pressure. Normal Pulmonary Function Tests Normal pulmonary function test results in a patient with chronic dyspnea do not mean the patient does not have a problem. Instead, that patient may have a disorder, such as heart failure, whose functional problems are not reflected in pulmonary function testing. In such cases, it is information gleaned from the history, physical exam and other diagnostic tests, such as chest radiography, that guide decisions regarding appropriate further evaluation and management.\\nAge-related changes in pulmonary function. Lung growth and maturation continue until maximal function is reached around 20-25 years of age. Function is generally maintained until age 35 after which age-related changes occur in various parameters. Some of the changes in respiratory system mechanics (e.g., loss of elastic fibers) responsible for these observed patterns are described in Chapter 4. The age-related decrease in FEV1/FVC is one reason why an absolute cut-off of 0.7 may be inappropriate for diagnosing obstructive lung disease as it may lead to misclassification of normal age-related. In addition to these observed patterns, there is significantly more interindividual variability in measured values in the elderly than in younger patient groups.\\nCases in pulmonary function test interpretation. To further your understanding of the concepts in this chapter, we can consider the following cases. For each case, review the numerical data and flow-volume loop, characterize the functional abnormality and devise an appropriate general approach to further work-up and management. You may assume the patients gave a good effort and all tests meet acceptability criteria.\\nA 59 year-old patient with a 60 pack-year history of smoking presents for evaluation of increasing dyspnea on exertion over a 9-month period. They note increasing difficulty with walking up hills and chores around the yard and a need to purchase a riding lawn mower because they were requiring too many rest breaks with their old walking mower. The patient denies chest pain with exertion and reports a stable weight and appetite. Using the stepwise approach outlined above, the interpretation is as follows: Step 1: Check Spirometry: The FEV1/FVC is reduced. Therefore, the patient has an obstructive ventilatory defect. Step 2: Check Lung Volumes: The TLC is within the normal range, indicating the patient does not have hyperinflation. The RV is increased indicating there is air-trapping (premature airway closure on exhalation causing an inability to fully exhale all of the air taken in at the start of the maneuver). Step 3: Check DLCO: The DLCO is markedly reduced, indicating that the surface area for gas exchange is impaired. This suggests that emphysema is a contributor to the patient\\'s airflow obstruction. Step 4: Check the Flow Volume Loop: The flow volume loop shows a decreased peak expiratory flow and a scooped out appearance of the expiratory limb, consistent with an obstructive pattern due to distal airway disease. Summary Severe obstructive ventilatory abnormality with air-trapping and a reduced surface area available for gas exchange. Appropriate Follow-Up The finding of an obstructive ventilatory defect in an individual with chronic dyspnea and a long history of smoking is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of COPD.No further diagnostic testing is necessary and this patient can be started on a medication regimen and other interventions appropriate for the severity of his disease and other aspects of the clinical picture.\\nA 63 year-old patient presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion over an 8-month period. The patient notes a dry cough but denies wheezing, chest pain on exertion, fevers or hemoptysis. The patient is a life-long non-smoker and worked as a teacher before retiring 2 years ago. There are no pets in the home and aside from some occasional gardening in the yard, there is no other significant exposure history. Using the stepwise approach outlined above, the interpretation is as follows. Step 1: Check Spirometry: Even though FEV1 and FVC are both markedly reduced, the FEV1/FVC is normal, indicating the patient does not have obstructive ventilatory defect. Step 2: Check Lung Volumes: The TLC is reduced, indicating the patient has a restrictive ventilatory impairment. The residual volume is low indicating the patient can exhale to a very low volume. Step 3: Check DLCO: The DLCO is markedly reduced, indicating that the surface area for gas exchange is impaired. This suggests that the cause of the restrictive defect is a process involving the lung parenchyma. Step 4: Check the Flow Volume Loop: The flow volume loop shows a normal peak expiratory flow and small vital capacity (distance moved along the x-axis). Severe restrictive ventilatory defect due to an intrapulmonary process. In addition to the low DLCO, the low RV also suggests the patient has an intraparenchymal problem. As discussed in Chapter 11, some intraparenchymal processes, such as pulmonary fibrosis, can tether open the airways on exhalation, thereby preventing their collapse and allowing forced exhalation to a lower volume than would otherwise be possible. A patient with a neuromuscular disease as the source of restrictive physiology would be unable to exhale to such a low volume because they lack the neuromuscular competence to forcibly exhale to this extent. Because the pulmonary function tests suggest the patient\\'s restrictive ventilatory defect is the result of an intrapulmonary process, the patient should undergo a high resolution Chest CT to assess the lung parenchyma. Further diagnostic testing such as bronchoscopy or surgical biopsy may be indicated based on the results of the CT scan.\\nVentilatory Control Disorders. Ventilation is regulated by a complicated feedback control system in which the basic breathing rhythm is generated in the brainstem and adjusted in response to mechanical and chemical stimuli and higher central nervous system inputs. The normal patterns of ventilation can be altered during exercise, sleep or with various disease processes. This chapter describes the ventilatory control system and the ways in which control of ventilation is altered. At the end of the chapter you should be able to: Describe the central control of breathing Review the major \"inputs\" to the central controllers including the central and peripheral chemoreceptors and airway and lung receptors Predict the ventilatory responses to changes in PCO2 and PO2. Describe the clinical presentation and outline a diagnostic and treatment approach for patients with the obesity hypoventilation syndrome Describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach and treatment for patients with the two main forms of sleep disordered breathing. Outline changes in control of breathing that occur in chronic lung diseases CONTROL OF BREATHING The Respiratory Pump and the Feedback Control Loop The respiratory \"pump\" is an integrated system consisting of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord, motor nerves, respiratory muscles and feedback control receptors that matches ventilation to metabolic needs. For example, at rest, minute ventilation is typically 4-6 L/min, whereas at maximum exercise it may be 150 L/min or more in highly fit individuals. These adjustments are made by the ventilatory control apparatus, which consists of sensors and central controllers that integrate inputs and regulate signals to the respiratory muscles. The central control of breathing is comprised of two major components.\\nAutomatic Breathing Control. This component stimulates breathing in a consistent, rhythmic way without conscious input (e.g., during sleep). The complicated system includes respiratory centers in the pons and medulla, nerve tracts in the lower brainstem and the feedback mechanisms that are both chemical and mechanical in nature. There are thought to be three major centers that generate rhythm and the \"drive\" to breathe, collectively referred to as the \"central pattern generator\". The cerebral cortex contains centers for voluntary control of breathing that allow us to modulate the rhythmic breathing pattern generated in automatic centers of the brainstem (eg during singing or talking). The voluntary and automatic control centers are connected by a variety of neural pathways that result in highly coordinated function during a wide variety of conscious and unconscious activities. Sensors Providing Input to the Controllers A variety of sensors within and outside the central nervous system respond to chemical and mechanical stimuli and provide input to the central controllers. Chemoreceptors The ventilatory control system alters ventilation in response to multiple chemical stimuli including changes in PO2, PCO2, pH and the concentrations of hydrogen ion and bicarbonate. Two primary centers are these chemoresponses: Peripheral Chemoreceptors: These include the carotid and aortic bodies, which are located at the carotid bifurcation on either side of the neck and the aortic arch, respectively. Each chemoreceptor receives an extremely high blood flow relative to its size and metabolism. PaO2, rather than oxygen content, is the principal chemical stimulus to these peripheral receptors, with receptor output and ventilation increasing as PaO2 declines. When blood oxygen content is lowered by anemia, there is little change in peripheral chemoreceptor output if PaO2 is not also reduced. Receptor neural output is minimal above a PaO2 of 200 mm Hg, increases gradually with lower levels, and increases much more rapidly below a PaO2 of 60 mm Hg. The peripheral chemoreceptors are also sensitive to responsible for arterial pH. A decrease in pH (acidemia) increases the firing rate and stimulates ventilation, whereas an increase in pH has the opposite effect. PaCO2 also directly stimulates the peripheral receptors, although the peripheral responses to CO2 are not as strong as the central chemoreceptor responses. The carotid bodies play a far greater role mediating these responses in humans than the aortic bodies. Central Chemoreceptors: The central chemoreceptors are located in the medulla. CO2 is a primary stimulant for changes in ventilation mediated by the central chemoreceptors. CO2 rapidly diffuses into/out of the CSF from the arterial blood, leading to changes in CSF pH that, in turn, alter chemoreceptor output. While it has long been thought that CO2 only acts on the central chemoreceptor via such changes in pH, more recent research suggests that CO2 may exert a direct effect independent of pH.Central chemoreceptor output also - concentrations but because the changes directly in response to H+ and HCO3 blood-brain barrier is much more permeable to CO2 than H+ or HCO3-, these responses are slower to develop. Clinically, this is why ventilation changes faster in response to respiratory acid-base changes (i.e., changes in PaCO2) than metabolic acid-base disturbances. There are interactions between the peripheral and central chemoreceptor responses that affect the overall ventilatory responses to changes in PaO2 or acid-base status. For example, following ascent to high altitude, a decrease in increase triggers an in ventilation mediated by PaO2 the peripheral chemoreceptors. This response decreases PaCO2, which causes an increase in CNS pH that, in turn, decreases central chemoreceptor stimulation to ventilation. With persistent hypoxemia, metabolic compensation for the hypocapnia occurs and the resultant changes in CSF H+ concentration lead to further increases in ventilation. Mechanico-Neural Receptors: Minute ventilation is also modified by mechanico-neural receptors that respond to stretch and other mechanical stimuli. Pulmonary stretch receptors located in the airways that are stimulated by increases in lung volume. For example, when the lung is held open at end- inspiration, respiratory rate decreases due to an increase in expiratory time (Hering-Breuer Reflex). Irritant receptors near the carina and central bronchi are stimulated by noxious gases, smoke, inhaled dust and cold air to generate the cough reflex, bronchoconstriction and hyperpnea (increased rate and depth of breathing). Juxtacapillary (J) receptors (non-myelinated C-fibers) found in the alveolar walls close to the pulmonary capillaries and in the bronchi close to the bronchial circulation that are stimulated by both circulating chemicals, such as histamine and bradykinin, and mechanical factors such as engorgement of the pulmonary capillaries, as seen in pulmonary edema from left heart failure. Musculoskeletal afferents stimulated by the stretching of skeletal muscle increase ventilation and may contribute to the initial hyperpnea of exercise. Ventilatory Responses to Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Tensions Most of the ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide are mediated by the central chemoreceptors with a small contribution from the peripheral chemoreceptors while the peripheral chemoreceptors. A term often employed when considering ventilatory responses to either gas is \"ventilatory drive.\" The stronger the ventilatory response to a given change in partial pressure, the stronger the \"drive.\" There are several key features about ventilatory drives to oxygen and carbon dioxide: is driven entirely by to hypoxemia the response Ventilatory drives to both gases vary between individuals. Ventilatory drives to both gases are largely determined genetically. For a given individual, the ventilatory drives to oxygen and carbon dioxide do not correlate well with one another. Ventilatory responses to hypercarbia and hypoxemia decrease with age. Ventilatory responses are depressed by sedatives, opiates and anesthetics. Responses to Changes in the Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide As PaCO2 increases, ventilation increases in a linear manner (Figure 8-3). The slope of this line represents the sensitivity of the system to PaCO2. The sensitivity can be augmented by hypoxemia (as the PO2 falls, the level of ventilation at any PCO2 is higher) and in certain disease states. In COPD patients with chronic hypercarbia, for example, the slope is decreased such that increases in PaCO2 lead to less vigorous changes in ventilation.\\n\\n\\nResponses to Changes in the Partial Pressure of Oxygen. As PaO2 decreases, ventilation increases, with the greatest increase seen when PaO2 falls below 60 mm Hg. There is also an interaction with the partial pressure of carbon dioxide. If PaCO2 decreases as ventilation rises, the hypoxic ventilatory response is diminished. Minute ventilation increases as PACO2 is elevated. Note ventilatory sensitivity to PACO2 (slope) increases with reductions in PaO2 (Although the signal is PaCO2, it is more convenient to monitor PACO2 in exhaled end- tidal gas). Figure 8-4: Hypoxemia response curve. Minute ventilation increases as PAO2 is decreased. (Although the signal is PaO2, it is more convenient to monitor PAO2 in exhaled end-tidal gas.) The response is diminished if PACO2 is permitted to fall due to hypoxic hyperventilation compared with the case if PACO2 is held constant by elevating inspired CO2 as hyperventilation occurs. The term \"not isocapnic\" means PCO2 is not held constant. Ventilatory Control During Common Activities Exercise Ventilation increases during exercise, but the precise mechanism remains unknown. Because ventilation increases almost immediately upon starting exercise, non-metabolic factors such as joint and muscle receptor input may play a role. As exercise continues, increased ventilation is likely driven by the need to supply oxygen to and eliminate carbon dioxide from exercising muscles. How the controller monitors O2 consumption and CO2 production is unknown. At very high levels of exercise intensity, individuals develop lactic acidosis, as oxygen delivery is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the exercising muscle. This leads to a sharp rise in ventilation and subsequent decrease in PaCO2 to compensate for the lactic acidosis and maintain an adequate pH (Chapter 14).  8 5 \\nSleep Three important changes in ventilatory control occur during sleep: (1) Voluntary control and other factors that override automatic control of breathing during wakefulness are lost at sleep onset; (2) The wakefulness drive to breathe mediated by excitatory inputs to the respiratory control center from the reticular formation, brainstem and hypothalamus is lost; and (3) hypercapnic and hypoxemic ventilatory responses are decreased. Other aspects of respiratory system function are also altered in sleep. The tone of the upper airway dilating muscles (genioglossus and palatal) and accessory muscles of respiration decrease during sleep, particularly during REM sleep. The former predisposes to upper airway narrowing while the latter increases the risk of nocturnal hypoventilation in patients with ineffective respiratory mechanics (severe COPD, neuromuscular diseases, obesity hypoventilation). Together with the alterations in ventilatory control noted above, these factors contribute to ventilatory abnormalities during sleep in certain individuals. THE PEDIATRIC PERSPECTIVE ON VENTILATORY CONTROL While the fetus is exposed to and tolerates very low PaO2 in utero, the ventilatory response to hypoxemia matures during late gestation. Infants have variable responsiveness to hypercapnia and hypoxemia compared to adults. Premature infants often have immature responses at all levels of respiratory control, which predisposes to a phenomenon known as \"apnea of prematurity,\" marked by periods of apnea (cessation of airflow) with associated hypoxemia and/or bradycardia. Almost all infants less than 28 weeks gestational age manifest apnea of prematurity. The problem resolves after 37 weeks of gestation. DISORDERS OF VENTILATORY CONTROL There are several general categories of disorders that involve alterations in ventilatory control including: (1) primary disorders of the central nervous system that affect ventilatory control and either increase or decrease the drive to breathe; (2) secondary disorders of ventilatory control in which the control system is altered in response to another problem, as seen in individuals with severe COPD or markedly increased body mass index (BMI); (3) sleep disordered breathing. Each category is considered below. Primary Disorders of Ventilatory Control A variety of central nervous system disorders cause increased or decreased ventilation by affecting regions of the brain involved in ventilatory control. Disorders Associated with Hypoventilation Patients with a history of significant central nervous system injury due to, for example, encephalitis, can develop decreased respiratory drive as sequelae of their injury if there was involvement of the ventilatory control centers. In rare cases, patients have decreased respiratory drive but no inciting cause is identified, referred to as Idiopathic Congenital Hypoventilation Syndrome. On lab evaluation, patients demonstrate a chronically elevated PaCO2 and hypoxemia. In particular, the arterial blood gas demonstrates a compensated 6  8 \\nlow PaCO2 (respiratory alkalosis). respiratory acidosis, a concept discussed further in the renal component of the course. The (A-a)ΔO2 is typically normal indicating that hypoventilation is the sole cause of the hypoxemia. These patients also manifest decreased ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and oxygen compared to normal individuals. Disorders Associated with Hyperventilation For reasons that are not entirely clear, certain acute disorders, including meningitis, encephalitis, stroke and traumatic brain injury, affect the central respiratory control centers and cause hyperventilation. On lab evaluation the arterial blood gas demonstrates a If hyperventilation persists long enough, the patient will have a compensated respiratory alkalosis. PAO2 is increased but whether the PaO2 is increased as well depends on the adequacy of ventilation-perfusion matching. Secondary Disorders of Ventilatory Control Several lung diseases are associated with alterations in ventilatory control. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Some, but not all, patients with severe COPD (Chapter 9) develop chronic hypercarbia because respiratory mechanics are impaired to the point that they cannot maintain enough alveolar ventilation to account for increased dead space and eliminate all of the carbon dioxide produced in the tissues. Typically, a patient\\'s FEV1 needs to be < 1L before they are at risk for this phenomenon. Hypoventilation causes hypoxemia but is not the only cause of hypoxemia as there is often significant VA/Q mismatch due to their airflow obstruction. These patients also have blunted ventilatory responses to increasing CO2 when compared to healthy individuals. This trait is likely acquired as their disease progresses but some evidence also suggests there is a genetic component as well. It is often mistakenly said that these patients \"no longer respond to CO2\" but the more accurate characterization of their responses to changes in PCO2 is that they are diminished relative to healthy individuals (Figure 8-5). Figure 8-5. Blunted ventilatory response to changes in CO2 tensions in a patient with severe COPD.A similar phenomenon is seen in patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome.  8 7 \\nDiffuse Parenchymal Lung Diseases Many patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other diffuse parenchymal diseases (Chapter 11) manifest chronic hyperventilation (chronic respiratory alkalosis). This is likely due to increased peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation due to hypoxemia but may also reflect stimulation of airway and other intrathoracic receptors. When diseases like pulmonary fibrosis become very severe, however, significant alterations in lung mechanics may, instead, cause chronic hypoventilation. Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS) Some, but not all patients with markedly increased BMI develop OHS, defined as the presence of daytime hypercarbia (PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg) in an individual with BMI > 30 kg/m2 and no other identified causes of hypoventilation. Pathogenesis: There are several mechanisms for the observed hypoventilation: Impaired chest wall mechanics: Due to excessive chest wall soft tissue, respiratory system compliance is decreased, causing lower tidal volumes. Because the anatomic dead-space is fixed, the lower tidal volume increases the dead space fraction and the individual must generate higher minute ventilation to sustain adequate alveolar ventilation. Affected individuals cannot maintain the higher minute ventilation due to the increased work of breathing that results from the lower compliance. Impaired muscle function: Biochemical disturbances related the increased BMI and hypoventilation may impair inspiratory muscle function and the ability to maintain the required work of breathing. Displacement of the diaphragm: Central fat distribution causes upward displacement of the diaphragm. This impairs the ability of the diaphragm to descend on inhalation, particularly when is in the supine position. Upward displacement of the diaphragm also causes increased airway resistance and premature airway closure on exhalation, leading to decreased ventilation of basilar lung regions and worsening VA/Q ratios. Increased airway resistance also contributes to the increased work of breathing. Altered ventilatory responses: Patients with OHS have blunted ventilatory responses to CO2 and hypoxemia (Figure 8-5) and often lack the drive to breathe necessary to maintain adequate minute and alveolar ventilation in the setting of the higher dead space fraction and work of breathing noted above. The impaired ventilatory responses to CO2 can be acquired in adulthood or represent a heritable trait. to Upper airway obstruction: Most patients with OHS have upper airway obstruction during sleep that contributes to daytime hypercapnia due to mechanisms beyond the scope of this course. Upper airway obstruction related to obstructive sleep apnea is discussed later in this chapter. For reasons that are not entirely clear, hypoventilation does not develop in all individuals with markedly increased BMI.8  8 \\nClinical Manifestations: Due to chronic alveolar hypoventilation, patients have decreased PAO2 and PaO2. Hypoventilation is not always the only cause of hypoxemia, as many patients also develop areas of low VA/Q as noted above. The low PAO2 triggers hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, which can lead to pulmonary hypertension. The low PaO2 causes increased erythropoietin secretion from the kidney, which can lead to increased hemoglobin concentration (polycythemia). Due to the high incidence of upper airway obstruction during sleep, patients develop problems related to obstructive sleep apnea (described below). Finally rates of systemic hypertension, congestive heart failure and angina are higher in patients with compared to individuals with an increased BMI who maintain normal CO2 levels. Pulmonary Function Testing: Individuals with markedly increased BMI have decreased expiratory reserve volume and a low FRC.The latter is due to the fact that the chest wall\\'s tendency to recoil outward is decreased by the weight of excessive soft tissue, shifting the balance between the lung and chest wall to lower volumes. TLC and VC are typically reduced in obesity hypoventilation syndrome but may be normal in normocarbic individuals with a high BMI.FEV1/FVC is usually normal while the DLCO is normal or mildly reduced. Arterial Blood Gases: Affected individuals have a chronic respiratory acidosis. Treatment: There are two primary management strategies: (1) treat nocturnal upper airway obstruction with positive airway pressure therapy (discussed below) and (2) weight loss, with bariatric surgery playing an important role given difficulties with dietary, activity and behavioral modifications alone. About half of individuals also require augmentation of ventilation at night using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. This intervention also addresses the upper airway obstruction issue. Exacerbations: Patients with OHS occasionally present with worsening hypercarbia, which manifests as altered mental status (discussed in Chapter 3). Because PaCO2 is determined by the balance between alveolar ventilation and carbon dioxide production, these episodes can be provoked (1) increased CO2 production due to, for example, infection and/or (2) decreased ventilation due to, for example, use of opiate pain medications or another process that alters mental status. Arterial blood gases show an acute on chronic respiratory acidosis. Management involves ventilatory support (either invasive or non-invasive ventilation) to decrease PaCO2 and a search for the inciting factor. Sleep Disordered Breathing Abnormal breathing patterns during sleep, referred to as Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB), are an increasingly recognized problem associated with significant health implications. Three disorders are considered here. Obstructive Sleep Apnea is characterized by repeated reduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) (hypopnea) or complete cessation (apnea) of inspiratory airflow due to partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. These events may result in hypoxemia and are usually terminated by brief arousals from sleep. The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is defined as the co-occurrence of OSA and  8 9 \\nto it (ie sleepiness, disrupted sleep, symptoms attributable impaired concentration). While OSA is not categorized as a ventilatory control disorder, it is included in this section of the course because ventilatory control abnormalities play a role in pathogenesis and it warrants consideration in conjunction with central sleep apnea, a disorder with important ventilatory control abnormalities. Pathogenesis: The key pathophysiologic feature of OSA is partial or complete collapse of the airway during sleep. Whether the airway remains open enough to maintain ventilation during sleep is determined by the balance between two factors: (2) extraluminal forces pushing in on the airway. Factors that tip the system towards more negative inspiratory pressure and/or greater extraluminal pressure pushing inward on the airway promote airway collapse (Figure 8-6). These factors include: inspiratory pressure) and intraluminal forces (negative (1) Figure 8-6: Key Factors in the Pathophysiology of OSA.The soft tissue is represented in grey. The black circles represent pharyngeal dilators with the dotted circle representing loss of tone. Pharyngeal dilator muscle (genioglossus and palatal) activity: These muscles are activated in the awake state and during inspiration, maintaining upper airway tone and counteracting extraluminal forces. The activity of these muscles and upper airway tone decrease during sleep (particularly REM sleep) increasing the tendency towards collapse. Pharyngeal dilators are also activated by negative airway pressure and increases in PCO2. Arousal from sleep can terminate apneas by activating these muscles. Soft tissue volume: excess soft tissue surrounding the airway increases extraluminal pressure and the tendency towards collapse. Lung volume: affects the compliance of the upper airway, as lung inflation applies caudal traction to the trachea and upper airway thereby stiffening it. Conversely, low lung volumes, which occur when individuals with increased BMI assume the supine position, decrease compliance and contribute to airway collapse. 10  8 \\n  Airway size: Because a narrow airway is more prone to collapse than a large airway, anatomic factors (e.g., large tongue, uvula, and tonsils) that narrow the airway increase the tendency towards obstructive events during sleep. Fluid shifts: In the supine position, fluid shifts from the legs towards the neck increasing neck circumference and extraluminal forces. Unstable ventilatory control: Instability in the feedback control system contributes to upper airway obstruction by altering signaling through the phrenic and hypoglossal nerves, which affects diaphragm and pharyngeal dilator tone, respectively. The mechanism behind this process is beyond the scope of this class. that result increases in sympathetic activity Acute Pathophysiology: OSA causes repetitive alterations in normal sleep physiology. Apneas can last from 10 to over 60 seconds. Arousals that terminate respiratory events cause sleep fragmentation that contributes to daytime sleepiness. Transient hypoxemia and hypercarbia caused by decreased ventilation mediate in vasoconstriction. Inspiratory efforts against a closed airway result in dramatic swings in intrathoracic pressure that can affect cardiac function by increasing afterload and impairing left ventricular relaxation. Chronic Pathophysiology: Chronic effects of OSA include sympathetic nervous system activation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, which lead to adverse cardiovascular outcomes including systemic hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure. OSA can also cause excessive sleepiness and diminished cognitive function, with associated problems such as motor vehicle collisions. Clinical Features: Patients with OSA or, commonly, their bed partners typically report loud habitual snoring. The partner may report frequent pauses, snorting and grunting during the patient\\'s sleep and/or the patient may report awakening with choking or gasping. Daytime sleepiness or fatigue is common but not always present. Patients report nocturnal symptoms (dyspnea, restlessness, nocturia, diaphoresis, reflux, dry mouth) and daytime symptoms (nasal congestion, morning headaches, impaired concentration, impotence, depression). Neck circumference and body mass index are often but not always increased. A neck circumference of 16 inches or more in females and 17 inches or more in males corresponds to at least an intermediate probability of having OSA.Physical exam findings that increase the likelihood of OSA include narrowing of the posterior oropharynx, enlarged tonsils, enlarged tongue, and enlarged uvula. Diagnosis: The diagnostic gold standard for OSA is polysomnography, an overnight sleep study during which sleep and indicators of cardio-respiratory physiology are monitored. Respiratory measurements include abdominal and chest excursion, nasal/oral airflow and pulse oximetry (Figure 8-7). The key finding that supports a diagnosis of OSA is episodic cessation or diminution in airflow with ongoing thoracic and abdominal breathing movements. Complete (apnea) and partial (hypopnea) breathing pauses are counted and divided by the total sleep time to calculate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), a  8 11 \\nmeasure that is used to establish whether OSA is present and its severity. A cut- off for the diagnosis of OSA is AHI >5. The higher the AHI, the more severe the OSA.Figure 8-7: Obstructive sleep apnea on polysomnography. Note that there is a period of no airflow (apnea) with continued thoracic movement. Treatment: There are several treatment modalities for OSA.  Conservative: Alcohol and sedatives exacerbate OSA and should be avoided close to bedtime. Avoiding the supine position reduces the severity of OSA in some patients, as the supine position promotes upper airway collapse via the effects of gravity on soft tissue and causes the tongue to fall back into and occlude the posterior oropharynx. Weight loss improves OSA but is hard to achieve and maintain. CPAP: Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP is the most efficacious therapy for OSA.Positive pressure is applied to the upper airway through a tight-fitting mask or nasal prongs. This creates a pneumatic splint (i.e., increases transmural pressure across the upper airway walls), which maintains patency of the upper airway (Figure 8-8). Figure 8-8: Mechanism of Action of CPAP.The soft tissues are shown in grey while the airway is the white circle. Application of positive airway pressure raises intraluminal pressure (PAW) during inhalation. This increases the transmural pressure (PIn - POut), which helps resist the inward pressure of soft-tissue surrounding the airway (extraluminal forces). This stents the airway open. 12  8 \\n Mandibular Advancement Devices: Mandibular advancement devices hold the mandible forward during sleep, thereby pulling the tongue forward and opening the posterior oropharynx. These devices are reasonably effective in up to 60% of patients and are typically used in patients with milder OSA or patients who do not tolerate CPAP.  Surgery: Several types of surgery directed at the nasal passages, palate, tongue and mandible have been used to treat OSA.They have variable effectiveness depending on individual anatomy and are usually not first-line therapy for OSA.Multiple surgeries are often needed for a reasonable chance of improvement. Predicting who will benefit from surgery is difficult. issues (anxiety, emotion The Pediatric Perspective on OSA: OSA is increasingly being recognized as a problem in the pediatric patient population. Many of the pathophysiologic and clinical features and treatment principles are the same as in adults with a few key differences that are worth highlighting. From a pathophysiology standpoint, one of the most common anatomic causes of OSA in children is airway narrowing due to hypertrophy of the tonsils and adenoids (adenotonsillar hypertrophy). Because adenotonsillar hypertrophy peaks between the ages of 2 and 8, the highest prevalence of pediatric OSA is seen in this age range. The big role played by adenotonsillar hypertrophy has relevance for the approach to treatment. Rather than being started on CPAP, children with OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy are typically first referred for resection of their tonsils and adenoids. CPAP is reserved for those in whom OSA persists after surgery or those without adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Inadequate treatment is associated with multiple problems in children including behavioral problems (aggression, impulsivity, hyperactivity), psychiatric regulation problems, depression) and decreased performance in school. The risk of cardiovascular complications is not as well established as in adults, but some data suggest children with OSA may develop hypertension as well as left ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular dysfunction. Central Sleep Apnea In contrast to OSA where inspiratory effort is maintained or increased, central sleep apnea (CSA) is characterized by apneas and/or hypopneas resulting from diminished or absent respiratory effort. There are several types of CSA including idiopathic CSA, high altitude periodic breathing, CSA secondary to opioid medication use and Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB). The remainder of this section on CSA will specifically cover CSB.Cheyne Stokes Breathing: is an important clinical entity seen in patients with severe heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction and some forms of neurologic injury (e.g., strokes intracranial hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury) and is characterized by recurrent apneas and/or hypopneas alternating with prolonged hyperpneas during which tidal volume gradually waxes and wanes in a crescendo-decrescendo pattern (Figure 8-9). These respiratory events can be associated with hypoxemia and fragmented sleep. Pathogenesis: There are several factors that interact to cause CSB including high baseline ventilation, increased chemoresponsiveness to changes in PCO2 and prolongation of circulatory time due to heart failure.  8 13 \\n Figure 8-9: Cheyne-Stokes Breathing. Periods of no airflow are accompanied by absence of thoracic and abdominal movement. All individuals have what is referred to as the \"apnea threshold,\" a level of PaCO2 below which respiratory effort ceases. This threshold is inactive in the awake state but active during sleep. Patients with chronic heart failure tend to hyperventilate due to stimulation of pulmonary vagal irritant receptors by pulmonary vascular congestion. As a result, PaCO2 is lower than normal. If PaCO2 falls below the apnea threshold, breathing ceases. Because there is no ventilation during an apneic period, PaCO2 rises and eventually crosses the threshold. The signal of the rising PaCO2 is received by the chemoreceptors but because the chemoresponsiveness of the central and peripheral receptors is increased in chronic heart failure, there is an overly large response to the rising PaCO2. Ventilation goes up significantly, driving the PaCO2 down and, importantly, back below the apnea threshold. The cycle repeats itself. This process is exacerbated by the prolonged circulation time that occurs due to poor pump function in heart failure. Increased circulatory time destabilizes control of breathing by delaying the time it takes blood leaving the lungs to reach chemoreceptors. As a result, the chemoreceptors lag in responding to PCO2 levels, resulting in overshoot and undershoot of ventilatory drive. Pathophysiology: CSB is associated with periodic breathing, arousals from sleep and episodic hypoxemia. These factors interact to cause disrupted sleep, oscillations in heart rate and blood pressure and increased sympathetic nervous system activity, which are likely responsible for the reduced survival seen in patients with heart failure who have CSB relative to those who do not. Clinical Features: Presenting features of CSA typically include daytime sleepiness, nocturnal awakenings or episodic nocturnal dyspnea, although some are asymptomatic. CSB may occur during wakefulness or exercise in patients with severe CHF, both of which are very poor prognostic signs. Diagnosis: The diagnosis of CSB should be considered in patients with severe heart failure, particularly those with atrial fibrillation, disrupted sleep or complaints of daytime sleepiness. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the characteristic crescendo-decrescendo pattern of respiratory rate and tidal volume accompanied by frequent arousals on polysomnography (Figure 8-9). Unlike in OSA, chest wall and abdominal movements are absent during apneic periods in CSA.14  8 \\nTreatment: varies based on the underlying cause of central sleep apnea. There are three general strategies for treating Cheyne-Stokes breathing: Optimize heart failure therapy: While this may reduce or abolish CSB, CSB can persist in some patients despite optimal management. improves left ventricular CPAP: By increasing intrathoracic pressure, CPAP decreases both preload and afterload. This function and decreases sympathetic nervous system activity, which often stabilizes breathing and leads to a decrease in the amount of central apnea. Oxygen: Short-term trials have shown improvement in CSB and reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity with use of low-flow nocturnal oxygen, possibly due to the removal of the destabilizing effect of episodic hypoxemia and its effect on ventilation. In addition, improved oxygenation may reduce the increased CO2 responsiveness that contributes to CSB.Sleep-Related Hypoventilation (SRHV) A number of physiologic changes predispose to hypoventilation during sleep, including increased upper airway resistance, a loss of the wakefulness drive to breath, decreased hypercapnic and hypoxemic ventilatory responses, and decreased voluntary muscle tone during REM sleep. Upon this background, conditions associated with decreased ventilatory drive, impaired respiratory muscle function or increased work of breathing, are more likely to result in inadequate ventilation and increased PaCO2 during sleep. This phenomenon, known as sleep related hypoventilation, can be seen in patients with chronic opioid or benzodiazepine use, markedly increased BMI, severe COPD and neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or diaphragmatic paralysis. Pathophysiology: SRHV results in periods of hypercapnia and hypoxemia, which can result in hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction causing pulmonary arterial hypertension and, possibly, right heart failure. Severe prolonged hypoxemia can cause polycythemia via elevation of erythropoietin. Disturbances in breathing cause sleep fragmentation resulting in daytime sleepiness or fatigue. Untreated SRHV may progress to worsening chronic daytime respiratory failure. Diagnosis: Polysomnography is often used to document SRHV and evaluate contributing causes such as OSA.Since PaCO2 is not typically measured during polysomnography, continuously low oxygen saturations occurring in the absence of OSA are considered to be suggestive, though not diagnostic, of SRHV.Daytime PaCO2 measurement can provide supporting evidence for the diagnosis. Treatment: Nocturnal oxygen therapy can relieve hypoxemia and is appropriate in some milder forms of SRHV but it does not relieve hypercarbia. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation applied via nasal or full facemask augments ventilation by providing a higher pressure on inspiration than exhalation and is an effective means of increasing nocturnal ventilation.  8 15 \\n 16  8 \\nChapter 9 Obstructive Lung Diseases: Asthma, COPD and CF INTRODUCTION Obstructive diseases are those conditions marked by the presence of reduced airflow on exhalation. This chapter provides an overview of the most common disorders, asthma and COPD, and also considers the pulmonary manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis (CF), a disease with elements of obstructive pathophysiology. After reading this chapter you should be able to: Outline the diagnostic approaches to asthma and COPD Describe the triggers and pathophysiology of acute asthma Identify the distinct pathological processes that contribute to COPD Identify features of emphysema on chest imaging Outline non-pharmacologic management strategies for asthma and COPD Describe the clinical features, diagnosis and management of CF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES Obstructive lung diseases demonstrate several characteristic derangements in pulmonary function, although there is some variability between patients with asthma and COPD, as well as between patients within each disease category due to differences in underlying pathophysiology and individual characteristics. Airflow Obstructive diseases are marked by decreased airflow on exhalation as a result of two problems: (1) increased airway resistance and (2) decreased driving pressure on exhalation, usually due to loss of lung elastic recoil from destruction of the lung parenchyma. On pulmonary function testing, the hallmark of this disease category is a low FEV1/FVC ratio. The flow volume loop often has a characteristic \"scooped out\" appearance due to differential rates of emptying across the lung during exhalation (Figure 9-1). In some cases, patients demonstrate a bronchodilator response in which the FEV1 and/or FVC improve(s) by 200 mL and 12% following administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. Figure 9-1: Flow volume loops in obstructive diseases. The loops typically show decreased peak expiratory flow and a \"scooped out\" appearance over most of exhalation due to different rates of emptying across lung units. Compliance In obstructive lung disease due to emphysema, compliance of the lung is increased due to loss of elastic recoil from destruction of lung parenchyma. Because the  9 1 \\nparenchyma is normal in asthma, lung compliance is typically unchanged, although it can acutely decrease in severe asthma exacerbations when air trapping and hyperinflation bring the individual to higher lung volumes and the flatter portion of the volume-pressure relationship (described in Chapter 4). Lung Volumes Functional residual capacity, the amount of gas left in the chest at the end of a tidal exhalation, is often increased (Figure 9-2) due to changes in the static recoil properties of the lung-chest wall system. This is more common in COPD than asthma. When obstruction is severe, gas can be trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Referred to as \"air-trapping,\" this problem manifests as an increase in residual volume (RV), the volume of air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. In emphysema, total lung capacity (TLC) often increases due to loss of lung elastic recoil (the chest pulls the system up to a higher volume). Depending on the how much RV increases relative to TLC, the vital capacity (VC) may be preserved or decreased. Figure 9-2: Changes in lung volumes in obstructive disease. RV, FRC, and TLC all tend to be increased in obstructive disease. When the volume of air trapped at RV is large, as it is in severe disease, the VC is decreased. Gas Exchange Hypoxemia is not present in all patients with obstructive lung disease but, when present, develops because impaired ventilation leads to areas with low VA/Q ratios. Patients with very severe airflow obstruction (usually FEV1 < 1 liter) can develop alveolar hypoventilation (high PaCO2) due to increased physiologic deadspace and difficulty maintaining minute ventilation due to mechanical limitations. In emphysema, the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is reduced due to the destruction of alveolar walls and the loss of the pulmonary capillary bed, which reduce the surface area available for gas exchange. The DLCO should be normal in asthma, because unlike in emphysema, the underlying lung parenchyma is normal and there is no destruction of the alveolar walls. ASTHMA Definition Asthma is a disorder primarily of the conducting airways, characterized by variable and recurring symptoms of dyspnea, airflow obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness, with the latter term referring to the tendency of airways to narrow in response to triggers such as allergens, exercise and airborne particles. 2  9 \\nThe widespread airway obstruction is generally reversible, either spontaneously or with treatment, although in some patients this reversibility may be incomplete. Etiology and Pathogenesis Asthma has both genetic and environmental components. Some individuals are more strongly predisposed to its development, and the most common clinical indicator of this is atopy (Type I hypersensitivity to environmental allergens). In such individuals, asthma symptoms are triggered by less intense environmental stimulation than in non-atopic individuals. However, the situation is highly complex and variable, and some people with asthma lack atopic features. Childhood infection may also play an important role in the genesis of atopy. According to the \"hygiene hypothesis\" (Figure 9-3), early exposure to infection - for example, via daycare, household pets, and farm environments - results in the development of predominately T-helper Th1-mediated immune response, and down-regulation of Th2-mediated response. Lack of exposure to microbes early in including development of allergic rhinitis, atopy, and predisposition to asthma. to an overactive Th2-mediated response, life predisposes Figure 9-3: The \"hygiene hypothesis\" of the pathogenesis of asthma. Adapted from Lugogo et al. Asthma in. Murray & Nadel\\'s Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. Mason et al. eds). Other factors may influence the development of asthma. For example, the prevalence is higher and manifestations more severe in children and adults with increased BMI.Maternal smoking during pregnancy and exposure to smoke in childhood increase the likelihood of wheezing and abnormal lung function among children. Disease prevalence is also inversely related to household income, as multiple factors including exposure to poor air quality, mold, cockroaches and others that trigger or worsen asthma symptoms, disproportionately affect lower income individuals. Pathology and Pathophysiology Asthma is a complex inflammatory process in which many cell types including neutrophils, T-lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, and macrophages elaborate mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, histamine, leukotrienes, reactive oxygen species, and thromboxane that, in turn, trigger exaggerated  9 3 \\nnarrowing of the airways due to smooth muscle constriction, mucosal edema, and mucus secretion into the lumen (Figure 9-4). Figure 9-4: Schematic diagrams of normal airways (left) and an airway wall showing the major features of asthma. Over time, airway remodeling occurs and is marked by goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial collagen deposition, smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, submucosal gland enlargement, and bronchial microvascular enlargement and proliferation. The inflammatory responses lead to airway hyperresponsiveness. These inflammatory responses and the clinical features of asthma can be triggered by a variety of stimuli (Table 9-1). You do not need to memorize this table for the course but must understand the role of triggers in disease control. Table 9-1: Common Triggers of Inflammatory Responses in Asthma Allergens Pollens Molds Dust mites Cockroaches Dander Irritants Tobacco smoke Wood smoke Air pollution Airway Drying and Cooling Exercise Cold air Occupational Exposures Isocyanates Paint spray Plicatic Acid Infections URIs The physiologic hallmark of asthma is airflow obstruction that varies over time or in response to bronchodilators. The majority of patients have normal spirometry much of the time. During symptomatic periods, the FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio are typically reduced. This may resolve spontaneously or following bronchodilator inhalation. Individuals with asthma often demonstrate more variability in expiratory flow (PEF) measurements compared to those without asthma (Figure 9-5). Airway obstruction is variable across all of the airways, and thus the distribution of ventilation is non-uniform. Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs in response to differences in ventilation across the lung but usually cannot restore normal VA/Q matching. While some degree of increased (A-a)DO2 is usually present, studies of acute severe asthma show little evidence of significant hypoxemia. As a result, the presence of hypoxemia is strongly suggestive of overt mucous plugging, pneumothorax or hypercapnia. 4  9 \\n Figure 9-5: Peak flow rates measured morning and evening over 10 days by a normal subject and one with asthma. Despite the airflow obstruction, PaCO2 is typically low in mild to moderate attacks for reasons that are not well understood. A normal PaCO2 is potentially worrisome in acute asthma, while an elevated PaCO2 with decreased arterial pH (referred to as acute respiratory acidosis) suggests severe obstruction and impending respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilatory support. The Role of Social Determinants of Health in Asthma Pathophysiology There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in both the prevalence of asthma and disease outcomes. For example, prevalence is highest among those of Puerto Rican or African American ancestry, while under-represented minorities are less likely to receive inhaled corticosteroids and more likely to receive asthma care in the emergency department rather than in the primary care setting. The important question that follows is why such disparities exist. While there are genetic factors that contribute to these differential outcomes, they are only part of the story. Importantly, the broad categories of race used in such studies to classify individuals do not adequately account for the significant differences in genetic ancestry that may exist within a particular category of race. Beyond potential genetic links, it is the social determinants of health that are major contributors to the differences in observed outcomes. For example, residence in urban areas contributes to worse asthma control, as the urban environment is associated with multiple factors including poor air quality, tobacco, ozone and particulate matter exposure and indoor allergens (dust mites, cockroaches, mold) that precipitate or aggravate asthma symptoms. Housing type (private family vspublic) has similarly been shown to affect outcomes, as residence in public housing is associated with many of the same factors noted with urban residency and is also accompanied by stressors including personal safety concerns, financial insecurity and unstable housing that also contribute to worse disease control. Nutrition, a variable that often reflects socioeconomic status may also play a role. For example, low vitamin D levels have been demonstrated in African American children and adolescents and linked to higher risk of hospitalization or emergency department visits for asthma. Beyond these factors, other issues such as health beliefs and attitudes, health literacy and challenges in cross-cultural communication also contribute to outcomes. While research in asthma outcomes has not explicitly looked at this issue, it is likely that structural racism also contributes to the observed disparities. To the extent that inherently biased policies (e.g., red lining) determine where people live, as  9 5 \\nwell as their access to insurance, adequate housing, medical care and other factors, they contribute to inadequacy of asthma control in many individuals. Clinical Features The cardinal symptoms of asthma are chest tightness, dyspnea, cough, and wheezing. Many patients experience all of these symptoms, particularly during acute episodes, but there is great individual variability. Some patients, for example, only have cough. Patients with significant atopy may predictably develop wheezing and dyspnea during pollen season, whereas others may have no seasonal variability and develop symptoms only in association with upper respiratory infections. Symptoms are often exacerbated by exertion, particularly in cold weather, and commonly occur at night or in the early morning hours. \"Acute severe asthma\" or an \"asthma exacerbation\" is as an attack of sufficient acuity and severity to bring the patient to the emergency department or other health care facility. \"Status asthmaticus\" refers to an episode of acute severe asthma in which several hours of intensive treatment fail to produce marked improvement. While exacerbations often occur due to viral or other respiratory infections, or exposure to inhaled allergens or irritants, they can also occur without clear inciting events. Natural History Asthma is more common in children than adults, implying that it resolves clinically in many individuals. Asthma can develop at any age, even without a family history or prior symptoms of the disease. Unlike COPD, which is a progressive disease, asthma usually does not progress in severity over time or become less responsive to treatment. Diagnosis Asthma is diagnosed by careful history, observation over time and demonstration of reversible airflow obstruction by one of several means: Airflow obstruction with a bronchodilator response on spirometry Temporal changes in spirometry relative to changes in symptoms Significant peak expiratory flow variability over time Because the clinical manifestations of asthma are often episodic, physical examination and spirometry may be normal at the time of evaluation. In patients with occasional mild symptoms fully relieved by inhaled bronchodilator, further diagnostic testing may be unnecessary. When the diagnosis is not clear and the patient has normal spirometry, additional testing, such as a methacholine challenge or exercise test protocols can be used to rule out the diagnosis. The methacholine challenge involves administering methacholine, causing bronchoconstriction, to an individual in steadily increasing doses followed by spirometry measurements (Figure 9-6). Healthy individuals require higher doses before airway narrowing occurs, while those with asthma experience bronchoconstriction at lower doses. The dose 6  9 bronchoprovocatory of a agent capable \\nrequired to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 from baseline is referred to as the PD20 (provocative dose for a 20% decrease). In an individual with an appropriate clinical history, a PD20 ≤ 4 mg/ml is consistent with the diagnosis of asthma. Figure 9-6: Methacholine challenge to determine bronchial hyper- responsiveness. Spirometry is measured after inhalation of increasing concentrations of methacholine. FEV1 measured at each concentration is plotted as percent of the control value. Classifying Disease Severity The management of chronic stable asthma begins with an assessment of two key factors including: (1) the adequacy of asthma control and (2) the risk for exacerbations. The adequacy of control is assessed by asking four basic questions about how the patient has fared in the preceding four weeks (Table 9-2). Based on the answers to these questions, patients are classified as having well-controlled, partly-controlled or uncontrolled disease. Table 9-2: Categorization Scheme for Adequacy of Asthma Control In the past 4 weeks has the Well- Partly- Controlled Uncontrolled patient had: controlled Daytime symptoms more than twice per week Any nighttime awakening due to Reliever needed more than twice asthma per week Answer \"No\" to all questions Answer \"Yes\" to 1-2 questions Answer \"Yes\" to 3-4 questions Any activity limitation due to asthma The factors used in the assessment of the risk for exacerbations are outlined in Table 9-3. It is worth noting that, in contrast to prior guidelines, this table incorporates socioeconomic factors as one of the risk factors for severe exacerbations Treatment Asthma management is based on an assessment of disease severity and risk for exacerbations as outlined above and relies on a combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches. The former are discussed in detail in Chapter 10 while the latter are discussed below. Non-Pharmacologic Measures Non-pharmacologic measures can be as important as choosing the proper medication regimen. A careful attempt should be made to identify and eliminate  9 7 \\ntriggers for the patient\\'s disease, including exposure to allergens, tobacco smoke, and factors in the workplace. Failure to address such issues can lead to ongoing poor disease control even if the patient is receiving an appropriate medication regimen. Table 9-3: Risk Factors for Asthma Exacerbations Uncontrolled asthma Medications: Not on ICS, frequent SABA use Poor adherence to medication regimen or inhaler technique Comorbidities: obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinosinusitis Exposures: smoking, allergens, air pollution Major socioeconomic problems Low FEV1, especially if less than 60% predicted Labs: sputum/blood eosinophilia Prior history of intubation or intensive care for asthma 1 or more severe exacerbations in last 12 months A growing body of work has also shown that interventions targeting the socioeconomic determinants of health can also have a significant effect on patient outcomes. For example, King County Public Health\\'s Community Healthy Worker program, in which frontline health workers with ties to the local community make home visits to low-income individuals with asthma to assess the home environment and self-management skills, educate the patients and help them navigate the health system, has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life and decrease urgent care use. Through the Healthy Homes Initiative, King Country Public Health has guided construction of several units in a recently built public housing complex with a variety of interventions (Figure 9-7) to improve indoor air quality and eliminate common triggers, including mold, moisture, roaches and rodents, for low-income patients with asthma. Figure 9-7: Schematic layout of a breathe easy home. Each of the items shown in the figure is designed to decrease exposure to a variety of triggers that contribute to poor asthma control and are often found in poor quality housing.

Pharmacologic management of asthma exacerbations is described further in Chapter 10. Noninvasive ventilation is often used in the emergency department but the evidence supporting its effectiveness is weak. Emergent hospitalization is often required. Those patients with respiratory distress, hypercarbia, altered consciousness, or important co-morbidities should be admitted to an intensive care unit. Asthma in Children The presentation of asthma in children is similar to that of adults. However, because children have much smaller airways than adults, children with asthma can develop respiratory distress very quickly during an exacerbation. Recall from the Chapter 4 that airway resistance is inversely related to the 4th power of the airway radius. As a result, 1mm of airway mucosal edema has a far greater impact on airway resistance in children with small airways than in an adult with larger airways. Optimal management is similar to that employed in adults and includes environmental control, pharmacologic therapy, patient/family education and attention to social determinants of health. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) Definitions COPD is a chronic condition characterized by respiratory symptoms and the presence of incompletely reversible airflow obstruction. It is a syndrome - a collection of history, physical exam, and laboratory findings that occur together and can be identified in patients - rather than a distinct disease entity. The syndrome of COPD develops as a result of two distinct diseases: Chronic Bronchitis This is diagnosed purely by history, based on the presence of a productive cough on most days for at least 3 months a year for 2 consecutive years or more. Most people who smoke > 1 pack of cigarettes per day have chronic bronchitis, although only a minority of them have airflow obstruction and are diagnosed with COPD.It is typically partly reversible if exposure to the offending agent is eliminated. Emphysema This is diagnosed anatomically, as a destructive process with dissolution of alveolar walls with enlargement of the alveolar spaces and loss of the pulmonary capillaries surrounding alveoli. Emphysema cannot be diagnosed without examination of lung tissue by histology or Chest CT scan. Emphysema is, by definition, irreversible. Some patients have predominantly one of these entities while many have a combination of the two. Some patients have \"asthmatic features\" in which an element of airflow obstruction varies spontaneously or to bronchodilators or corticosteroids. The airflow obstruction is not completely reversible, however.  9 in response 9 \\nEtiology and Pathogenesis In high-income countries, the main cause of COPD is cigarette smoking. Because many long-time smokers do not get COPD, host factors undoubtedly affect who develops the disease. In low-income countries, workplace and environmental exposures are important risk factors for COPD.In particular, prolonged exposure to smoke from cooking indoors with wood and animal fuels is a major cause of COPD in women in many regions of the world. Pathophysiology Airflow Obstruction Emphysema causes airflow obstruction by decreasing lung elastic recoil, a primary determinant of expiratory flow. It also reduces airway caliber, as alveolar destruction reduces the tethering effect on airways of adjacent lung parenchyma, and allows airway collapse especially on forced expiration. Chronic bronchitis contributes to airflow obstruction by causing bronchial wall edema, submucosal tissue thickening, glandular hypertrophy, and increased airway secretions. After about the age of 30, FEV1 declines by an average of 20-30 mL/yr in healthy individuals. Patients with COPD lose airway function at variable rates ranging from those seen in healthy individuals to accelerated rates as high as 50-90 mL/yr. Smoking cessation reduces the rate of functional decline to approximately that of nonsmokers (Figure 9-8). As a result, smoking cessation remains the single most important intervention in the management of any stage of COPD.Figure 9-8: Relative rates of decline in lung function. The rate of decline is fastest in those individuals with COPD who continue to smoke. Smoking cessation slows the rate of FEV1 loss to approximately that of a never-smoker. Air Trapping and Hyperinflation Many patients are prone to air trapping and hyperinflation, particularly during periods of exercise or anxiety when their respiratory rate increases and expiratory time decreases or during disease exacerbations when airflow obstruction worsens (Figure 9-9). Air trapping and hyperinflation contribute to dyspnea as hyperinflation flattens the diaphragm, thereby decreasing contractile efficiency and increasing the difficulty breathing. Hypoxemia Hypoxemia results from hypoventilation and/or VA/Q mismatching. Although derangements in gas exchange are more likely and more marked as disease 10  9 \\nseverity increases, there is considerable variability. Due to variation in VA/Q matching, some patients experience clinically important hypoxemia with modest obstruction, while others maintain normoxemia and normocapnia despite a very low FEV1 (Figure 9-10). Figure 9-9: Dynamic air trapping in COPD.(A) Normal: The inspired volume is completely exhaled well before the next inspiration. (B) Airflow obstruction. Expiration is slower but complete after each inspiration. (C) In the presence of more severe obstruction or more rapid respiratory rate, exhalation is incomplete and end-expiratory lung volume (FRC) increases. Figure 9-10: VA/Q Matching in COPD.Left panel: Areas of low VA/Q beyond obstructed airways lead to hypoxemia due to continued perfusion of poorly ventilated areas. Right panel: hypoxemia may not occur if ventilation and perfusion are reduced in parallel, as in emphysema. Increased Dead Space Although we typically think of low VA/Q as the primary problem of ventilation- perfusion matching in COPD, there is actually significant heterogeneity in VA/Q relationships and, as a result, a considerable amount of high VA/Q and dead space units as well. The mechanism for increased deadspace in emphysema is illustrated in Figure 9-11. The air in the center of enlarged airspaces is too far from the capillaries in the wall of the air spaces to participate in gas exchange, as diffusion cannot occur efficiently across such distances. Because they receive ventilation but are not effectively perfused, these zones function as dead space. Hypercarbia As airflow obstruction worsens, patients with COPD maintain near normal PaCO2 until reaching a very severe stage (FEV1 < 1 L or < 25% of predicted) when PaCO2 rises in some individuals. This variability is due in part to the interindividual differences in lung mechanics and respiratory drive. Those with high drive maintain alveolar ventilation (higher than normal total ventilation to compensate for increased deadspace ventilation) but experience more dyspnea as they try to meet this demand. Those with lower drive tolerate hypoventilation and increased PaCO2 but have more hypoxemia due to the lower average alveolar PO2.  9 11 \\n Figure 9-11: Mechanism for Increased Dead Space in COPD Pulmonary Hypertension Severe COPD can cause pulmonary hypertension and, if untreated, right heart failure. This is due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance due to: (1) hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction due to chronically low PAO2; (2) capillary destruction and loss of cross sectional area for blood flow; and (3) respiratory acidosis. Clinical Features Symptoms The most common symptoms of COPD are chronic cough, sputum production, and dyspnea with exertion. Symptoms vary in severity between individuals based on: Severity of airflow obstruction (decrement in FEV1) Degree of hyperinflation Reversibility of airflow obstruction Strength of respiratory drives in response to oxygen and carbon dioxide Severity of hypoxemia A COPD exacerbation is an acute, sustained worsening of the patient\\'s symptoms from the usual stable state. Exacerbations are commonly triggered by a respiratory infection, but can occur due to inappropriate medication use and other problems. Exacerbations usually develop over one to several days and are marked by the presence of increased dyspnea, increased sputum production and/or a change in sputum color. Physical Findings During quiet breathing, patients with mild or moderate COPD typically have a normal physical exam. Inspiratory crackles may be heard at the lung bases, and scattered wheezes may be present on forced exhalation. The physical finding that most correlates with the presence of airflow obstruction is a prolonged forced expiratory time. In more severe disease, patients have signs of hyperinflation including an increased antero-posterior diameter (\"barrel chest\"), inferiorly displaced diaphragms with little detectable movement, and hyper-resonance to percussion. Breath sounds may be diminished in all areas, and there may be scattered wheezes and pops. Pursed-lips breathing and use of the accessory muscles of respiration may be noted. Finger clubbing (See Figure 9-19) is not 12  9 \\nusually seen in COPD and, when present in a long-time smoker, should raise suspicion for lung cancer. During exacerbations, patients typically are more hypoxemic than usual and may have acute ventilatory failure with acute- or acute-on-chronic hypercarbia due to ventilatory muscle fatigue from the acutely increased work of breathing. Patients typically demonstrate increased work of breathing and accessory muscle use as well as extensive wheezing on exam. The absence of wheezing in a patient with increased work of breathing is a concerning sign, as it implies the airflow obstruction is so severe that there is insufficient flow to even cause wheezing. Natural History The clinical features of COPD are not linearly related to the rate of decline in lung function (Figure 9-12). Although a productive cough may be present for years, dyspnea on exertion and other symptoms typically do not appear until there is a substantial reduction in FEV1. Because routine activities use only a small fraction of our ventilatory capacity, patients don\\'t experience limitation until 50% or more of lung function is lost, and may not seek medical attention until airflow obstruction is moderate to severe. In the later stages of the disease, however, additional decrements in lung function have more and more clinical impact. Figure 9-12: General relationship between decline in lung function and symptoms in COPD.Diagnosis and Classification of Severity Pulmonary Function Testing While many people with COPD have not been diagnosed, many people who smoke are labeled as having COPD despite never having formal diagnostic testing because they have dyspnea or chronic bronchitis. While certain elements of the history and physical exam are suggestive of COPD, diagnosis requires spirometry and demonstration of airflow obstruction (low FEV1/FVC ratio). For practical use, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) uses an FEV1/FVC threshold of < 0.70 for identifying the presence of obstruction. This is a fair approximation of the lower limit of normal in the 40-60 age range but, due to the normal age-related trend of this ratio, it leads to over-diagnosis in the older population and misses true obstruction in younger people with asthma Table 9-4 shows the standard classification of the severity of abnormalities seen on pulmonary function testing. The decrement in FEV1 alone is a poor indicator of overall disease severity: some people with a severely decreased FEV1 are not very  9 13 \\nStage I II III IV Severity Mild > 80% 50-79% 30-49% < 30% * Based on best post-bronchodilator measurements Moderate Severe Very Severe impaired while others with milder changes in FEV1 are quite symptomatic with frequent exacerbations. Measurements of lung volume and diffusion capacity can identify whether the patient has hyperinflation (increased TLC), air-trapping (elevated RV) and capillary loss (low DLCO). Arterial blood gases are used to identify patients with chronic hypoventilation (increased PaCO2) due to severe disease. Table 9-4: Classifying Severity of Airflow Obstruction on Spirometry * FEV1 (% predicted) Chest Imaging On the plain chest radiograph, signs of emphysema include generalized hyperlucency, flattened diaphragms, attenuation of the pulmonary vascular markings in the periphery of the lung fields, and an increase in the retrosternal air space seen on the lateral view (Figure 9-13). Chest CT is also very sensitive for identifying emphysema. Some patients have severe air-space enlargement in one or more localized areas, producing very large air spaces referred to as \"bullae\" (Figure 9-14). Although all of the signs mentioned are typical, they may be absent in patients with severe obstruction, and it is a (common) mistake to make the diagnosis of COPD on chest imaging alone (Use spirometry!). Figure 9-13: Chest radiograph findings in emphysema. Panel A: the patient has hyperinflation, flat hemidiaphragms and a paucity of lung markings in the upper lung zones. Panel B: the lateral film shows the flattened diaphragms (black arrows) and an enlarged retrosternal airspace (white arrow). Treatment Once COPD is diagnosed by spirometry, management is focused on three areas: risk reduction, control of stable disease and treatment of exacerbations. 14  9 \\nFigure 9-14: Emphysema on Chest CT.Panel A: The black areas represent enlarged airspaces due to destruction of alveolar walls. Grayer areas are normal lung tissue. Panel B: The large black spaces marked \"B\" are giant bullae that formed due to exaggerated airspace enlargement. Risk Reduction All patients diagnosed with COPD should undergo smoking cessation counseling and receive pneumonia vaccination and yearly influenza vaccination. Smoking cessation is the only way to slow the rate of decline in FEV1 over time. Management of Stable Disease Management of stable disease involves pharmacologic therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation and, in some cases, supplemental oxygen. The approach to pharmacologic management is described in Chapter 10. The other important non-pharmacologic measures are discussed below. Pulmonary Rehabilitation: All patients of at least moderate-severity COPD should be referred for pulmonary rehabilitation, a multidisciplinary program shown to improve functional capacity and quality of life. Oxygen: Long-term continuous oxygen therapy (LTOT) is one of the few treatments shown to improve life expectancy in COPD - and only in those with documented, chronic hypoxemia while clinically stable (resting PaO2 < 55 mm Hg or SpO2 < 88%). A survival benefit has not been demonstrated in patients with milder degrees of chronic hypoxemia. LTOT can also improve pulmonary hypertension by relieving alveolar hypoxia. Surgical Management: Two options are considered with severe disease: Lung-Volume Reduction Surgery (LVRS): involves removing markedly emphysematous upper lobe tissue to reduce hyperinflation and improve airflow and diaphragm function. The surgery has substantial mortality and morbidity, and is an option for relatively few, well-selected patients. Lung Transplantation: Least successful to date among solid-organ transplants with respect to both short- and long-term outcomes (median survival is now 6.7 years), it is mainly performed in patients with very severe COPD and absence of other serious illness.  9 15 \\nManagement of Exacerbations Management of exacerbations consists of excluding other specific causes for clinical worsening (e.g., pneumonia or pulmonary embolism), pharmacologic interventions, supplemental oxygen administration and, in severe cases, mechanical ventilatory support. In patients with overt respiratory failure, a trial of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation is used as the first line of ventilatory support instead of intubating the patient. The key aspects of pharmacologic management are discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Disparities in COPD Prevalence and Outcomes The prevalence of COPD in the United States is highest among Caucasians and African Americans and lower among Asian and Hispanic populations, although there is significant heterogeneity among the latter group based on whether they are of Caribbean or Mexican origin. The precise mechanism for the observed differences has not been established but is likely multifactorial with contributions from socioeconomic, environmental and biologic/genetic factors. Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (measured by income, education and occupation) are more likely to develop COPD and have higher rates of hospitalization and increased mortality. These differences likely reflect the fact that lower socioeconomic status is associated with multiple factors, including smoking, occupational exposures, prenatal and childhood exposures, air pollution and adverse housing conditions that predispose to development of disease and challenges in management. Outcomes also vary as a function of race, as African Americans are less likely to receive advice regarding smoking cessation, less likely to receive ambulatory oxygen (as opposed to in-home systems) and, despite having a lower prevalence of COPD than Caucasians, have experienced a faster increase in COPD-related death rates. Electronic Cigarettes Electronic cigarettes have been marketed as a safer way to deliver nicotine as well as method to help people quit using combustible tobacco products. Despite their increasing use, however, the long-term safety of these products remains unclear as there has been insufficient time since their entry into the market to conduct adequate longitudinal studies of their risks, including those of emphysema and lung cancer. Evidence from bronchoalveolar lavage studies in users of electronic and combustible cigarettes have shown that electronic cigarettes lead to similar disruptions of the protease-antiprotease balance in the lung as seen with combustible tobacco, suggesting that electronic cigarettes may not, in fact, decrease the risk of emphysema. The increasing use of electronic cigarettes has become a significant public health issue, as increasing use among adolescents and teenagers raises the risk that many of these users will become addicted to nicotine and eventually convert to combustible tobacco use. ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is a circulating glycoprotein whose primary function is inhibition of the proteolytic enzyme elastase. Its severe deficiency, an inherited condition, results in development of emphysema due to increased destruction of elastin, a protein critical for maintenance of the normal elastic recoil of the lung. Emphysema due to AAT deficiency occurs at an earlier age or with less smoking than usually seen in COPD and is distributed more evenly through the lobule 16  9 \\n(panlobular emphysema) and typically is more severe in the lung bases than in the apices - the reverse of the pattern seen in \"usual\" COPD (Figure 9-15) . Figure 9-15: Chest Radiograph in Alpha-one Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency. Note the characteristic radiographic features of emphysema including hyperinflation, flat diaphragms and a narrow mediastinum. The key feature of AAT in this film is that the hyperlucency (absence of lung markings) is predominantly in the lung bases as opposed to the apices, as is seen in patients with centrilobular emphysema due to smoking. There are over 150 AAT alleles, with the normal phenotype designated PI-MM.These individuals have normal levels of AAT and normal function. Among the abnormal variants, deficient alleles cause decreased plasma AAT levels, while null alleles lead to absent AAT in plasma and dysfunctional alleles produce normal levels of an improperly functioning AAT.When serum AAT levels fall below a protective threshold as a result of a given genotype, the individual is at increased risk for emphysema and COPD.Cigarette smoking markedly accelerates development of these problems. Because pulmonary disease in AAT deficiency is linked directly to the amount of functional AAT in the serum and presumably the alveoli, treatment involves replacement therapy with pooled human AAT.The remaining aspects of pharmacologic management (e.g., inhalers) and other aspects of supportive care, (supplemental oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation and vaccination) are the same as for patients with COPD not related to AAT deficiency. CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multi-system disease caused by the loss of function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), a transmembrane protein present in a variety of cell types and tissues. While CF also affects other organs such as the liver and pancreas, the focus in this discussion is on the pulmonary manifestations, the major source of morbidity and mortality in this disease. Genetics As discussed MCBD, the gene coding for CFTR is on the long arm of chromosome 7. CF follows an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The most common variant (called Phe508del) results from the deletion of three base pairs and accounts for approximately 70% of all CF alleles. There are, however, over 1500 other mutant alleles associated with the disease, but aside from Phe508del, none of these is found on more than 4% of CF chromosomes. Updated features for  9 17 \\ndisease-causing or potential disease-causing variants within the CFTR gene are publicly available for reference (https://www.cftr2.org). Pathophysiology The CF gene encodes for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a membrane glycoprotein whose functions includes being a chloride channel and regulator of sodium and other ion transport pathways. Normally, CFTR is found in the apical surface of epithelial cells of the lung and other organs. The various genetic variants have different functional implications for the CFTR, with some variants affecting its synthesis, maturation or regulation and others affecting chloride channel conductance or the quantity of channels in the cell membrane (Figure 9-16). Figure 9-16: Functional classes of variants in the CFTR.Variants affecting synthesis, maturation and regulation of CFTR tend to yield more severe disease while variants affecting the quantity of CFTR in the cell membrane or chloride conductance yield less severe disease. In the lung, decreased chloride efflux from the respiratory epithelium causes poor hydration of the periciliary fluid layer and increased mucous viscosity. This impairs mucociliary clearance and predisposes to airway infection and inflammation (Figure 9-17). Figure 9-17: The Pathophysiology of Cystic Fibrosis 18  9 \\nPulmonary Manifestations Histologically, the lung is normal at birth, but disease can progress rapidly causing air-trapping with some degree of bronchiectasis by 6-24 months. Bronchiectasis - thickening and distortion of the airway walls due to chronic inflammation - causes worsening of the already abnormal airway clearance and is associated with chronic cough productive of abundant purulent sputum. Clinical Pulmonary Problems Patients with CF have multiple clinical pulmonary issues: Airflow Obstruction: this results from accumulation of mucous in the airways due to impaired mucociliary clearance. Infection: Although most aspects of immune function are normal in CF, chronic airway infection occurs almost universally due to impaired mucociliary function and poor secretion clearance. Infection is predominantly caused by S.aureus, H.influenza and P.aeruginosa. Some patients develop growth with non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Aspergillus often colonizes airway secretions in severe CF but rarely causes invasive disease. Patients colonized with aspergillus are at risk for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, a disorder marked by abnormal immune system responses to aspergillus antigens. Hemoptysis: Blood streaking of the sputum is common while massive hemoptysis occurs in up to 10% of adults. This is due to bleeding from the bronchial circulation, which hypertrophies due to chronic airway infection. Pneumothorax: Pneumothorax occurs in CF patients with severe pulmonary disease due to rupture of cysts near the lung surface. Clubbing: Clubbing of the fingers (Figure 9-18) and the toes is eventually a universal finding in patients with CF-related pulmonary disease. Figure 9-18: Nail clubbing. The image on the left shows normal fingernails while the image on the right demonstrates a patient with clubbing. Acute exacerbations: Many patients develop acute pulmonary exacerbations, marked by combination of increased cough, shortness of breath, work of breathing and chest congestion as well as a change in sputum, decreased exercise tolerance, hemoptysis, and weight loss. Diagnostic testing often reveals a decrease in FEV1, and leukocytosis, while changes in chest radiography are uncommon. Hypoxemia occurs in those with severe underlying disease. Frequent  9 19 \\n or severe exacerbations are related to a more precipitous decline in lung function and trigger evaluation for lung transplantation to prevent death. Findings on Diagnostic Testing Pulmonary Function Testing: Patients initially have air trapping (increased RV) before later developing airflow obstruction and, in severe disease, mixed obstructive and restrictive defects (low FEV1/FVC and TLC). Arterial Blood Gases: With disease progression, the (A-a)ΔO2 increases due to areas of low VA/Q and some patients develop hypercarbia, an ominous sign associated with increased mortality risk. Chest Imaging: Hyperinflation, peribronchial cuffing, and mucus plugging in the upper lobes are early chest imaging findings. With progression, bronchiectasis and fibrosis with scarring and upward retraction of the hila occur (Figure 9-19). Figure 9-19: Imaging in Cystic Fibrosis. Panel A: plain chest radiograph. Diffuse opacities represent fibrotic changes while the arrows point to abnormal dilated airways. Panel B: Chest CT.The arrows point to abnormally dilated airways. Extrapulmonary Manifestations Patients are at risk for a variety of extrapulmonary manifestations (Table 9-5). Table 9-5: Extrapulmonary Manifestations of Cystic Fibrosis System Manifestation Opacified sinuses Nasal polyps Recurrent sinus infections 20  9 Gastrointestinal tract Hepatobiliary Pancreas Reproductive tract Sinuses Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome Intussusception / Rectal prolapse Meconium ileus at birth Increased risk of colon cancer Hepatomegaly / Splenomegaly Cirrhosis / Portal hypertension Exocrine insufficiency with fat malabsorption Endocrine insufficiency with CF-related diabetes Obstructive azospermia with infertility in males \\nDiagnosis Neonatal Screening All babies born in the United States are screened for CF with either serum immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT), +/- DNA testing to identify common disease- causing variants. Sweat chloride testing is then used to confirm a positive IRT test with a value > 60 mmol/L considered abnormal and consistent with a diagnosis of CF.The specific practice varies from state-to-state within the U.S.Identification through screening is now the most common means of diagnosis. Disease Manifestations and Confirmatory Testing CF can also be diagnosed in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with CF (e.g., meconium ileus, failure to thrive, recurrent sinopulmonary infections) and either elevated sweat chloride or two disease-causing variants. Treatment of CF-Related Lung Disease Principles of chronic disease management and exacerbation management are described below Chronic Disease Management The mainstay of chronic therapy for pulmonary disease in CF is airway clearance, aimed at removing inflammatory secretions and slowing development of bronchiectasis. Postural drainage and percussion, deep breathing exercises, various coughing techniques, breathing devices and exercise have all been used to enhance airway clearance. With no \"optimal\" method, airway clearance is tailored to the individual patient based on perceived effectiveness and adherence. Additional anti-inflammatory and airway clearance strategies either improve pulmonary function and/or decrease the rate of exacerbation, including: Azithromycin: Although typically used as an antibiotic, this agent also has anti- inflammatory properties. Recombinant (human) DNase: Much of the viscosity of airway secretions in CF relates to the high concentration of free DNA released by lysed neutrophils. Delivery of rhDNase via nebulizer thins airway secretions. Hypertonic Saline: Inhalation of hypertonic saline via nebulizer pulls water into the airway and restores the depth of the periciliary mucus layer. This improves ciliary function and, as a result, innate airway clearance. Inhaled Antibiotics: Inhaled tobramycin, aztreonam and other antibiotics are used to suppress bacterial levels and inflammation. CFTR Modulators: These medications are used to treat the functional CFTR protein defect rather than just the downstream consequences. This includes, for example, \"corrector\" therapies that improve the folding and cell-surface transport of the proteins when CFTR levels are reduced and \"potentiator\" therapies that enhance sodium and chloride channel function in patients with normal numbers but reduced function of CFTR.The indications for eligibility of a particular CFTR modulator depends on an individual\\'s CFTR genotype, topics that are beyond the scope of this course.  9 21 \\nTreatment of Exacerbations Pulmonary exacerbations are treated with antibiotics and increasing the frequency of airway clearance maneuvers. Antibiotics are chosen based upon sputum culture sensitivities. Because Pseudomonas aeruginosa is often resistant to several antibiotics and resistance increases over time, patients typically require a long duration of at least two anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics. Prognosis Improvements in care have led to in dramatic improvements in survival and quality of life for CF patients such that many of them are living into adulthood; currently in the U.S., predicted median survival for CF is 47 years and over 50% of individuals with CF are over the age of 18. Long-term prognosis is most closely related to the degree of pulmonary dysfunction, though nutritional status and other organ involvement also contribute to the morbidity and mortality risk of the disease. Ultimately, over 95% of CF patients die from respiratory failure. 22  9 \\nChapter 10 Pharmacology of Obstructive Lung Diseases INTRODUCTION While medications, and in particular inhalers, are just one component of successful management of asthma and COPD, they nevertheless play a key role in the treatment of chronic, stable disease as well as exacerbations. The purpose of this chapter is to review this component of disease management in greater detail with a focus on the general approach to choosing and altering medication regimens, key clinical questions that arise in the management of these patients and important pharmacologic principles for each of the major classes of medications. After reading this chapter you should be able to: Assess the severity of asthma and COPD and choose appropriate initial medication regimens Describe the principles guiding escalation of therapy for individuals whose symptoms are not well controlled on their current medication regimen Compare the pharmacologic approach to management of asthma and COPD exacerbations Describe the pharmacokinetics, mechanism of action and major side effects of the primary classes of medications used to treat asthma and COPD GENERAL CONCEPTS Before describing the specific pharmacologic management principles for asthma and COPD, it is useful to consider some general concepts. Reliever Versus Scheduled Medications There are two general classes of medications used in the management of asthma and COPD.  Scheduled Medications: This term refers to medications - typically long- acting inhalers but on occasion pills - that are used on a scheduled (typically daily) basis for ongoing control of symptoms. Patients use these medications daily regardless of the state of their symptoms. They are often referred to as \"controller\" medications Reliever Medications: This term refers to medications used for immediate relief of symptoms. They are used on an \"as needed\" or \"prn\" basis at the patient\\'s discretion in response to increases in symptoms. In COPD, this is typically short-acting b2-adrenergic receptor agonists (\"beta-agonists\") or muscarinic receptor antagonists (\"anti-muscarinics\") inhalers; in asthma, the standard reliever is now a combination of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol (a long acting b2-adrenergic receptor agonist with rapid onset). Previously, the primary rescue inhaler in asthma was the short-acting b2- adrenergic receptor agonist albuterol. Inhalers and Nebulizers The primary medications used in the management of asthma and COPD are administered via the inhalational route with direct delivery to the sites of action in  10 1 \\nthe airways. Deposition of the inhaled particles in the target location is largely determined by the size of the particle, which affects the distance traveled along the airway and the mechanism for impacting the airway mucosa (described in Chapter 15). Most controller medications are administered using one of a variety of different inhaler devices, of which there are two general types: Metered-dose inhalers (MDI): Upon actuation, a chemical propellant creates a puff or spray of medication that is subsequently inhaled, carrying the measured dose of the medication into the airways. These devices require the patient to coordinate actuation of the inhaler with inhalation of the spray, something that is challenging to do for some patients. Dry powder inhalers (DPI): The medication is delivered in powder form rather than as a spray. These inhalers are less reliant on coordinating the timing of inhalation relative to actuation and, as a result, are theoretically easier for patients to use. The precise mechanisms by which these inhalers function vary from product-to-product and are beyond the scope of this course. In addition to delivery via inhalers, the short-acting b2-adrenergic receptor agonist albuterol and anti-muscarinic ipratropium can be given via nebulized solution. A nebulizer uses compressed air or oxygen to break up solutions or suspensions into fine droplet aerosols which the individual then inhales with the aid of a mouthpiece. These are commonly used in children or other patients who cannot properly coordinate MDI use and are a mainstay of therapy in the hospital. With proper inhaler technique, however, MDI are equally effective means of drug delivery as nebulizers. Stable Disease Versus Exacerbations As noted in Chapter 9, patients with asthma or COPD are at risk for disease exacerbations in which they experience marked increases in symptoms that prompt visits to clinic or the emergency department and, in many cases, admission to the hospital. For COPD, exacerbation management relies on frequent use of the short-acting b2-receptor agonists and anti-muscarinic agents (administered via either inhalers or nebulized solution), systemically delivered corticosteroids and other interventions depending on the severity of the exacerbation. For asthma, exacerbations are primarily managed with systemically delivered corticosteroids, frequent use of the short-acting b2- receptor agonists (administered via either inhalers or nebulized solution), antibiotics (e.g., respiratory fluoroquinolone or a macrolide). Antimuscarinics are added in severe exacerbations while subcutaneous epinephrine and intravenous magnesium are employed in patients not responding to the above measures. ASTHMA Chronic Disease Management The management of chronic stable asthma begins with an assessment of two key factors including: (1) the adequacy of asthma control and (2) the risk for exacerbations. The adequacy of control is assessed by asking four basic questions about how the patient has fared in the preceding four weeks (Table 10- 2  10 \\n1). Based on the answers to these questions, patients are classified as having well-controlled, partly-controlled or uncontrolled disease. Table 10-1: Categorization Scheme for Adequacy of Asthma Control In the past 4 weeks has the patient had: Daytime symptoms more than twice per week Any nighttime awakening due to Reliever needed more than twice asthma per week Well- controlled Partly- Controlled Uncontrolled Answer \"No\" to all questions Answer \"Yes\" to 1-2 questions Answer \"Yes\" to 3-4 questions Any activity limitation due to asthma The factors used in the assessment of the risk for exacerbations are outlined in Table 10-2. Table 10-2: Risk Factors for Asthma Exacerbations Uncontrolled asthma Medications: Not on ICS, frequent SABA use Poor adherence to medication regimen or inhaler technique Comorbidities: obesity, gastroesophageal reflux, rhinosinusitis Exposures: smoking, allergens, air pollution Major socioeconomic problems Low FEV1, especially if less than 60% predicted Labs: sputum/blood eosinophilia Prior history of intubation or intensive care for asthma 1 or more severe exacerbations in last 12 months Once assessment of disease severity and risk for exacerbations is completed, patients are managed using a step-wise approach to care based on the 2019 GINA guidelines (Figure 10-1). You do not need to know the specific agents at each step but should understand several key aspects of the approach. Step 1 is only suitable for patients with symptoms less than twice per month and no risk factors for exacerbations. Other patients start at Step 2 and higher As severity worsens, the regimen is adjusted by either increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and/or by adding one of several different agents, including long-acting b2-adrenergic receptor agonists (LABAs), leukotriene receptor antagonists, or a biologic agent. Use of methylxanthines such as aminophylline or theophylline is now highly uncommon due to the narrow therapeutic window of these agents.  10 3 \\nFigure 10-1: Stepwise Approach to the Management of Asthma. Issues in Chronic Disease Management Important clinical issues in the management of chronic, stable asthma include the following: Change in the Approach to Reliever Medications For many years, short-acting b2-receptor agonists (SABA, typically albuterol) were the primary reliever medication for immediate relief of increased symptoms. With increasing appreciation of the role that inflammation plays in the pathogenesis of asthma, it was felt that as needed SABA use was insufficient for this purpose, as it only addressed bronchoconstriction and did not target the underlying inflammation driving the increased symptoms. The issue was subsequently studied in several large randomized controlled trials in which the combination of a low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and the long-acting b2- receptor agonist formoterol was found to be more effective than a SABA alone at preventing exacerbations. For this reason, the primary reliever medication is now the low-dose ICS-formoterol combination. Formoterol is suitable for this purpose because, unlike the other major LABA, salmeterol, it has a fast onset of action. If a combination inhaler is not available, the patient can use their low-dose inhaled corticosteroid at the time they use their SABA.Long-acting b2-Receptor Agonist (LABA) Use Based on data suggesting an increased risk of worsening disease control and more frequent exacerbations, LABAs should not be used as monotherapy (i.e., the only controller medication) in patients with asthma. They should only be used in conjunction with an inhaled corticosteroid. Anti-muscarinics in Asthma Unlike in COPD, long-acting anti-muscarinics (LAMAs) have traditionally not played a significant role in chronic, stable asthma management. Recent data, however, suggest that when added to ICS, LAMAs may decrease the risk of exacerbations. However, they do not offer increased therapeutic benefit over LABAs, nor is there additive benefit to triple therapy with ICS, LABA and LAMA.4  10 \\nBiologic Agents When asthma remains suboptimally controlled despite high dose ICS and one or more non-steroid controller medications, consideration is given to adding one of several biologic agents that target inflammatory pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Patients who meet specific criteria are eligible for treatment with these medications. For example, patients with elevated IgE levels may qualify for omalizumab, a selective monoclonal antibody targeted for IgE.Biologics targeting IL-5 (mepolizumab, resolizumab), or the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor (dupilumab) are also available for patients with elevated eosinophils on their white blood cell differential. New agents continue to enter the market and use will likely increase as these medications become more cost effective and clinical efficacy is documented. The process of adding and choosing between such medications is beyond the scope of this course. Exacerbation Management (Acute Severe Asthma) The primary goal is relief of airflow obstruction and acute hyperinflation. Frequent administration of inhaled SABAs, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., oral prednisone or intravenous methylprednisolone), and supplemental oxygen are the cornerstones of treatment. Inhaled anti-muscarinics, intravenous magnesium sulfate and subcutaneous epinephrine are used as adjuncts in severe cases when patients do not respond to corticosteroids and SABA alone. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there are signs of bacterial infection. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) Chronic Disease Management As with asthma, pharmacologic management of stable COPD begins with an assessment of disease control, which takes into account two variables: assessment of symptom severity (based on scoring systems beyond the scope of this class) and the number of exacerbations leading to hospitalization per year. Based on these two variables, a patient is classified as falling in one of 4 categories in the scheme shown in Figure 10-2. Figure 10-2: Assessment of Disease Control in COPD Designation of the appropriate category is then used to select the initial medication regimen (Table 10-2). Once this regimen is selected, the intensity of treatment can be escalated (e.g., adding a second long-acting bronchodilator) depending on symptom control and exacerbation frequency. Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) are recommended for all patients on an as-needed basis, regardless of disease severity. Ipratropium, a short-acting  10 5 \\nanti-muscarinic, is avoided for prn use in patients already on a long-acting anti- muscarinic such as tiotropium. Table 10-2: Medication Selection in Management of Chronic, Stable COPD A B C D Group Initial Treatment Regimen A short or long-acting anti- muscarinic or b2-agonist Long-acting anti-muscarinic or long acting b2-agonist Long-acting anti-muscarinic Long-acting anti-muscarinic or Long-acting anti-muscarinic plus long acting b2-agonist or long acting b2-agonist plus ICS The decision about whether to begin therapy with a LAMA or LABA is beyond the scope of this course. You also do not need to memorize the escalation strategies for the purpose of this course. Issues in Chronic Disease Management Important clinical issues in the management of chronic, stable COPD include the following: First-Line Controller Therapy Bronchodilators - either LABA or LAMA - are the primary controller medications in COPD.Unlike in asthma, where inhaled corticosteroids are the primary controller medication, they are only used in the more severe stages of COPD.Safety of Long-acting b2-Receptor Agonist (LABA) Use While concern has been raised about the safety of LABA use in patients with asthma, LABA monotherapy has been studied and found to be safe in patients with COPD.Beta-blocker Use in Patients with COPD Due to the shared risk factor of tobacco use, many patients with COPD also have ischemic heart disease and require beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol) as part of therapy for that problem. Concurrent use of beta-blockers and inhaled b2- receptor agonists has been studied in COPD and been found to be both safe and associated with decreased mortality, likely due to the positive effects with regard to heart disease. Biologic Agents Monoclonal antibodies targeting IgE, IL-5 or the IL-4-receptor are not currently recommended for COPD treatment. Escalation of Therapy In patients with frequent exacerbations requiring hospitalization, consideration is given to adding the macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, or the phosphodiesterase- 6  10 \\n4 inhibitor, roflumilast to the patient\\'s other medications. Research studies indicate both agents can decrease the risk of exacerbations. Generalizability of Data In the studies that shaped current pharmacologic approaches to COPD management, enrollment of females and under-represented minorities was low. As a result, whether the management guidelines apply equally across all sexes and ethnic groups is unclear. Exacerbation Management Pharmacologic management of exacerbations requires frequent administration of both short acting b2-receptor agonists and anti-muscarinics, systemically delivered corticosteroids and, that cover Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella species (typically azithromycin or a respiratory fluoroquinolone). A comparison with management of asthma exacerbations is provided in Table 10-3. Table 10-3: Comparison of Asthma and COPD Exacerbation Management in severe cases, antibiotics Asthma Exacerbation Systemically delivered COPD Exacerbation Systemically delivered Treatment Corticosteroids b2-receptor agonists Anti-muscarinics Antibiotics Adjuncts In severe cases Yes No Magnesium, subcutaneous epinephrine Yes Yes Yes None intravenous * Systemically delivered corticosteroids: oral prednisone or methylprednisolone MEDICATION CLAssES Each of the major medication classes are reviewed in greater detail below with an emphasis on important pharmacologic principles including nomenclature, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, metabolism and toxicity. b2-adrenergic Receptor Agonists Nomenclature b2-adrenergic receptor agonists (referred to commonly as \"b-agonists\" or \"b2- receptor agonists\" and not to be confused with b1-adrenergic receptor agonists used in heart failure) are categorized by duration of action. The main categories and agents within them are as follows: Short-acting (SABAs): albuterol, levalbuterol. Typical duration: 4-6 h. Long-acting (LABAs): salmeterol, formoterol. Typical duration: ~ 12 h. Ultra-long acting: indacterol. Typical duration: ~24 h. Mechanism of Action b2-receptor agonists were chemically designed via modifications of the structure of epinephrine. This produced small molecules with favorable pharmacokinetic  10 7 \\nprofiles and a high degree of selectivity for the b2-receptor, compared to the b1- and b3-subtypes. For example, the SABA albuterol binds with >1000-fold higher affinity to the b2-subtype than the other subtypes. Once bound, albuterol and levalbuterol produce a structural rearrangement in the b2-receptor, resulting in the dissociation of the cytosolic heterotrimeric Gas protein complex. Gas activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which rapidly produces cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from ATP.cAMP activates protein kinase A, leading to phosphorylation of a variety of substrates, resulting in a number of cellular events including: increased activity of myosin light chain phosphatase, opening of K+ channels, decreased intracellular Ca2+ levels, inhibition of myosin-actin to bronchodilation (Figure 10-3). filament contraction, which, together, lead Figure 10-3: Mechanism of action of b2-receptor agonists Pharmacokinetics The SABAs and one LABA - formoterol - have a rapid onset of action (minutes), while another LABA, salmeterol, requires more time to onset. Unlike the SABAs, LABAs, such as formoterol and salmeterol, have a much longer duration of action because they contain long, lipophilic side chains that are thought to attach to the plasma membrane, thus maintaining them in close proximity to b2-receptors for an extended period. This permits LABAs to dissociate and re-associate repeatedly from the b2-receptor to induce consecutive bronchodilatory Gas signaling events in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Routes of delivery of each drug also affect therapeutic efficacy, although in most cases b2-agonists are administered via inhalation (discussed previously). Metabolism b2-agonists are primarily metabolized by sulfate conjugation in the intestines and liver, although this varies depending on the specific drug and route of delivery, which are beyond the scope of this chapter. Significant concentrations can be excreted unchanged. Metabolism can differ significantly between individuals depending on genetic background, age, sex, BMI, drug interactions, and other medical conditions. 8  10 \\ntissues, in non-bronchial Toxicity The primary toxicities associated with b2-receptor agonists are due to chronic, repeated use, resulting in high plasma concentration and activation of b- receptors the most prominent being cardiac (tachycardia) and skeletal muscle (tremor). However, because b2-receptors are fairly ubiquitously expressed and, as a result, found on the vast majority of cell types in the body, it is difficult to predict all the potential side effects of overzealous b2-receptor agonist use. Tremor occurs in ~5-14% of patients and can be induced by both SABAs and LABAs. Tremor occurs more frequently with oral administration than inhalation. Although the precise molecular mechanism by which b2-receptor agonists induce tremor remains unclear, substantial clinical evidence indicates this may be related to skeletal muscle expression of b2-adrenergic receptors. The tremor is reversible with beta-receptor antagonists such as propanolol. The mechanism for mild tachycardia, which is often experienced with 1st time users of SABAs and LABAs is also unclear. Potential explanations include reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system in response to b2-receptor stimulated vasodilation (recall that b2-receptors dilate vascular smooth muscle, but this effect is masked endogenously as norepinephrine also activates vasoconstrictor a1-adrenergic receptors); or direct activation of beta-receptors on cardiac myocytes. Rarely, b2-receptor agonist use has resulted in myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. Patients at high risk for cardiovascular events (ie heart failure, smoking, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes) should be carefully monitored and warned of potential dangers of excessive SABA/LABA use. Tolerance/Tachyphylaxis Repeated administration of b2-receptor agonists can receptor \"desensitization\", characterized by a progressive decrease in agonist efficacy and blunting of intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. However, clinical trials comparing the efficacy of b2-receptor agonists in chronic vsacute users suggest b2-receptor-agonist tolerance may not develop as rapidly as laboratory models predict, and in fact, may only affect duration of action, rather than agonist efficacy. Desensitization should be considered in patients experiencing reduced therapeutic efficacy with chronic b2-receptor-agonist use. induce The cellular and molecular mechanisms dictating b2-receptor agonist desensitization and drug tolerance have been an area of active basic science research for several years. The accepted model by which b2-receptor agonist tolerance develops is as follows (Figure 10-4): Phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues located on the intracellular loops and C-terminus of the b2-receptor by G protein-coupled Receptor Kinases (GRKs) Docking of the protein beta-arrestin to the phosphorylated residues on the b2- receptor. Beta-arrestin blocks the ability of the heterotrimeric Gas-protein  10 9 \\ncomplex to re-associate with the b2-receptor, thus preventing downstream signaling. Figure 10-4: Molecular mechanism of Beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist induced tolerance in airway smooth muscle cells Prolonged binding of beta-arrestin the b2-receptor produces \"downregulation\". This lysosomes, receptor degradation, and complete loss of receptor function, requiring new receptor synthesis to occur. involves receptor endocytosis into to Conversely, removal of agonist from the b2-receptor can result in a \"re- sensitization\" of the receptor, whereby beta-arrestin decouples from the receptor, the G-alphas complex re-associates with the receptor, and b2- agonist activity is restored. Muscarinic Receptor Antagonists Nomenclature Similar to the b2-receptor-agonist, muscarinic receptor antagonists are also classified by duration of action. The main categories and agents within them are as follows: Short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs): ipratropium Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs): tiotropium, umeclidinium Mechanism of Action The human genome encodes 5 distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5). In the lungs, the M1, M2 and M3 subtypes are expressed and functional. Stimulation of the M1 and M3 subtypes by the parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine induces mucous secretion by the tracheobronchial glands and contraction of airway smooth muscle. 10  10 \\nThe M1 and M3 subtypes are both G protein-coupled receptors that signal through the Gaq/11 pathway (Figure 10-5). Activation of phospholipase-C and production of intracellular signaling effectors inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), increases intracellular Ca2+ levels, thereby inducing mucous secretion from glandular cells and smooth muscle contraction. antagonists in airway smooth muscle cells. Figure 10-5: Mechanism of action of M1/M3 muscarinic receptor Muscarinic receptor antagonists are selective for the M1 and M3 subtypes. These drugs are competitive, and thus prevent endogenous acetylcholine from activating both M1 and M3, thereby reducing mucus secretion and inhibiting bronchoconstriction. Pharmacokinetics Naturally occurring muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine and scopolamine have been used for centuries to treat dyspnea. The tertiary structure of these compounds ensures substantial lipid solubility and enhanced volume of distribution, and thus increases the probability of blocking muscarinic receptors in non-bronchial tissues. Common side effects of tertiary muscarinic antagonists include dry mouth, tachycardia, skin flushing, blurred vision and mood changes, which can reduce therapeutic efficacy and patient adherence. Synthetic muscarinic receptor antagonists (ipratropium, tiotropium umeclidinium) are quaternary ammonium compounds, making them freely soluble in water and insoluble in lipids. Thus, when administered at the appropriate dosage, quaternary muscarinic antagonists produce very minor off-target effects due to their inability to cross lipid membranes and be absorbed from bronchial passages or the gastrointestinal lining. The duration of action of muscarinic antagonists directly correlate with their dissociation rates from the M1 and M3 subtypes. For example, the LAMA tiotropium has been estimated to remain bound to the M3 subtype for up to 62 h. However, with appropriate dosing, LAMAs are clinically effective for about 24 h. Metabolism  10 11 \\nMuscarinic receptor antagonists are mostly excreted unchanged in the urine (~70%). Metabolism does occur in the liver via Phase I CYP450 oxidation, followed by Phase II glutathione conjugation. The products of metabolism are inactive. Toxicity Administration of quaternary muscarinic antagonists produces very few toxic effects, due to their poor lipid solubility and minimal absorption across epithelial linings. The most commonly reported adverse effect is xerostomia (dry mouth) which affects <10% of patients. Although the risk of cardiovascular events is low for muscarinic antagonists, patients with COPD should be monitored for such complications. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids (or glucocorticoids) are used as a \"controller therapy\" to treat underlying two general categories: inflammation, particularly in asthma. There are Inhaled: beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone, triamcinolone Systemically administered: prednisone, methylprednisolone The primary benefit of the inhalational route of administration is localized delivery to the airways which reduces the side effects associated with chronic corticosteroid administration. Systemically delivered corticosteroids produce significantly higher systemic concentrations and carry a higher risk of both acute (hyperglycemia, delirium) and chronic toxicities (hypertension, glaucoma, diabetes mellitus, weight gain). Corticosteroids bind and activate glucocorticoid (GC) receptors in the cytosol of inflammatory cells, causing the GC receptors to dimerize, translocate to the cell nucleus, and produce an anti-inflammatory gene transcription profile (ie iIL-2, COX; hIkB). The mechanism of action and toxicities of GCs were discussed in greater detail in the Invaders and Defenders block (Figure 10-6). 12 Figure 10-6: Mechanism of action of glucocorticoids  10 \\nare and eicosanoids Antileukotriene Agents Leukotrienes other immunocompetent cells by the enzyme 5-lipooxygenase (5-LO) in response to toxic insults or infectious pathogens. Leukotriene D4 (LTD4) contracts bronchial airway smooth muscle, induces inflammation, enhances mucus secretion, and increases vascular permeability. Two classes of drugs ameliorate the proinflammatory actions of LTD4 in patients with asthma. leukocytes produced Leukotriene receptor antagonists: The proinflammatory actions of LTD4 in bronchial airways are produced primarily through activating the Leukotriene Type 1 (CysLT1) G protein-coupled receptor. Zafirlukast and montelukast are selective, competitive antagonists for the CysLT1 receptor that effectively block the actions of LTD4. LTR antagonists are administered daily in pill form. Toxicities are variable and uncommon (<2%). in 5-Lipoxygenase inhibitors: Zileuton inhibitor of 5- lipoxygenase that is approved for prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma as well as other inflammatory conditions. However, chronic zileuton therapy has been associated with elevated transaminases, a marker of liver injury, and, as a result, is not recommended for first-line therapy. is a selective leading Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors Phosphodiesterases are enzymes that metabolize cyclic nucleotide second messengers cAMP and cGMP, thereby terminating their cognate downstream signaling events and physiological outputs. In airway smooth muscle cells, recall that cAMP is produced by adenylyl cycylase in response to b2-adrenergic receptor activation, to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Thus, inhibiting phosphodiesterases that breakdown cAMP with methylxanthines such as aminophylline or theophylline represents an alternative approach to treating asthma that is suboptimally controlled with corticosteroids, b2-adrenergic receptor agonists and other agents. Use is limited, however due to the narrow therapeutic index, risk of toxicity (nausea, CNS disturbances, headache, cardiovascular events) and high potential for drug-drug interactions. Mast cell stabilizers Cromolyn (aka cromoglicic acid) and nedocromil are available for use in patients who are poorly controlled with standard pharmacological approaches or in patients with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. These drugs function by stabilizing airway mast cells, preventing degranulation and release of proinflammatory and bronchoconstrictive agents such as histamine. The precise mechanism of action by which these agents stabilize mast cells remains unknown. Although cromolyn and nedocromil have favorable toxicity profiles, their diminished efficacy relative to inhaled corticosteroids has limited their utility in clinical practice. Biologic Agents Biologics are available for the treatment of severe asthma unresponsive to other agents and include monoclonal antibodies administered via subcutaneous  10 13 \\ninjection. The agents are all very expensive and patients must meet standardized criteria to qualify for their use. Omalizumab: is a recombinant humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that binds free IgE, preventing IgE from interacting with IgE receptors on mast cells, and inhibiting mast cell degranulation. Maximal therapeutic efficacy typically occurs >12 weeks following treatment, as free IgE levels must be lowered substantially before effects are observed. Although omalizumab is typically well tolerated, hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis have been commonly reported. Benralizumab, Mepolizumab and Reslizumab: are humanized monoclonal antibodies that selectively bind the pro-eosinophilic cytokine interleukin-5. These agents are used to prevent exacerbations in patients with high blood eosinophil counts. These agents are generally well-tolerated Dupilumab: is a human monoclonal antibody that binds the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor, thereby inhibiting the activity of IL-4 and IL-12, and reducing inflammation in patients with severe asthma and elevated blood eosinophil counts. H1-Histamine Receptor Antagonists H1-histamine receptor antagonists (commonly referred to as \"antihistamines\") are commonly used for the treatment of allergenic symptoms including rhinitis, pruritus, urticaria and nasal congestion. All drugs in this class are competitive antagonists for the H1-histamine G protein-coupled receptor. Antihistamines are typically categorized by their pharmacokinetic properties and can be grouped into two classes. 1st Generation: This class includes diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, cetirizine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine. They are highly lipophilic, readily cross the blood brain barrier, and block H1 histamine receptors in the CNS, leading to one of the common side effects, drowsiness. Most 1st generation antihistamines have anticholinergic properties and, as a result can produce dry mouth, tachycardia, pupil dilation, urinary retention. Significant CNS disturbances may occur with overdose while older patients are highly susceptible to delirium after receiving these agents. 2nd Generation: This class includes loratadine and fexofenadine. They are zwitterionic, meaning they contains both + and - charged functional groups in the primary structure. Because they cannot effectively cross the blood brain barrier, they have far fewer CNS effects than the first generation agents and, as a result, are more suitable for daytime use. 14  10 \\nSAMPLE CASES CASE 1 Initial Presentation: A 64 year-old patient presents to clinic for follow-up of a hospital admission for what was diagnosed as a COPD exacerbation. This is the second hospital admission for respiratory problems in the past 6 months. In addition to these admissions, the patient has had 1-2 years of progressive dyspnea on exertion. They can walk about 20 minutes on flat ground before stopping to rest, have to slow down on hills but can still use a walking mower in the yard, albeit at a slower pace than in the past. Pulmonary function tests were ordered at the time of discharge from the hospital and are available at the clinic visit: Pre-Bronchodilator Post-Bronchodilator Actual % Change Actual Predicted % Pred. Test FEV1 FVC 1.4 2.3 0.61 3.6 4.5 0.80 38 51 - 1.5 2.4 71 7 4 - FEV1/FVC Question: What is the appropriate initial medication regimen for this patient? Follow-Up: The patient presents for follow-up 2 months later and notes ongoing dyspnea on exertion. In addition to visiting Urgent Care once during this period, the patient notes that their exertional tolerance remains impaired with little change in symptoms from the time of the initial medication prescription. Question: What changes if any would you make in the initial medication regimen? Explanation This patient meets criterial for COPD.They have a risk factor, chronic respiratory symptoms and evidence of airflow obstruction. These symptoms would likely be designated as high symptoms. Based on the categorization scheme in Figure 10- 2, this patient would be classified as having category C disease. Even though the symptoms would likely be considered low, the fact that the patient required 2 hospital admissions puts them in Category C.Using the information in Table 10- 2, it would be appropriate to start this patient on a long-acting inhaled bronchodilator tiotropium or umeclindinum. You would also provide them with a short-acting b2-receptor- agonist as \"rescue inhaler,\" (albuterol) but because you are using a long-acting anti-muscarinic, would not prescribe a short-acting anti-muscarinic agent (ipratropium). Note that even though the patient does not have a bronchodilator response on pulmonary function testing, it is appropriate to use a long-acting bronchodilator as a controller medication. Upon follow-up, the patient has not had any improvement in symptoms. In this case, it would be appropriate to escalate therapy by adding a long-acting b2- receptor agonist such as salmeterol or formoterol. They should continue with the short-acting rescue inhaler. If the patient failed to respond to this change or had ongoing exacerbations, consideration would then be given to adding an inhaled the anti-muscarinic category such as from  10 15 \\nTest FEV1 FVC Actual 3.4 4.9 0.69 Predicted % Pred. 81 89 - 4.2 5.5 0.76 corticosteroid. Medications such as azithromycin or roflumilast might be added if the patient continued to have exacerbations requiring hospitalization. CASE 2 Initial Presentation: A 27 year-old patient with no history of tobacco use presents to clinic for evaluation of dyspnea, cough and chest tightness. The symptoms occurred 2 months earlier in April when the trees and flowers started blooming and resolved after several weeks. They borrowed a friend\\'s albuterol inhaler, which seemed to help, but since the symptoms resolved, they have only had to use it a single time one week ago following a soccer game. There have been no nighttime awakenings for respiratory symptoms. The patient is employed and has stable housing in a newly constructed building and demonstrates good inhaler technique in clinic. Spirometry is performed in clinic and reveals the following: Pre-Bronchodilator Post-Bronchodilator Actual % Change 3.9 4.9 0.87 15 0 - FEV1/FVC Question: What is the appropriate initial medication regimen for this patient? Follow-Up: The patient presents for follow-up in February and reports having to use their albuterol inhaler nearly every other day for the past month, particularly after morning workouts at the gym. They have woken up several times in the past two weeks with coughing and chest tightness and on several of those times opted to try a puff of the inhaler, which seemed to help for the rest of the night. Question: What changes if any would you make in the initial medication regimen? Explanation At the time of the initial clinic visit patient has symptoms compatible with asthma, including intermittent dyspnea, cough and chest tightness, as well as spirometry demonstrating reversible airflow obstruction. This information is sufficient to make a diagnosis of asthma. Given the relative infrequency of symptoms since the initial problem in April, this patient would be best characterized as well- controlled asthma. There are also no risk factors for exacerbation, as the patient has good inhaler technique, acceptable socioeconomic circumstances, and an FEV1 > 80% predicted. As such, this patient is suitable for Step 1 therapy in which case, it would be appropriate to prescribe a low-dose ICS-formoterol combination inhaler for use on an as-needed basis. A scheduled medication is not necessary at this time. When the patient presents for follow-up, however, it is clear that their symptoms are not under good control as they are using the rescue inhaler on a frequent basis during the day and have also been waking up at night with respiratory symptoms. Given the worsening symptom control, it would be appropriate to add a scheduled medication. For patients with asthma, the appropriate first-line 16  10 \\nmedication would be a low-dose ICS.If symptom control improves upon reexamination, the patient would continue on the controller medication. If, however, symptoms remained poorly controlled or were worsening, either the dose of the ICUS would be increased or another controller medication such as a long-acting b2-receptor-agonist could be added to the regimen. If symptoms worsen in the spring when pollen counts are high, consideration can be given to adding a non-sedating anti-histamine during that time of year.  10 17 \\n 18  10 \\nChapter 11 Diseases With a Restrictive Pattern on Pulmonary Function Testing INTRODUCTION This chapter describes a heterogeneous group of disorders marked by a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. The unifying feature of these disorders is an inability to expand the respiratory system sufficiently on inhalation due to abnormal respiratory mechanics. Because respiratory mechanics relies on the lungs and musculoskeletal system, problems with the lung parenchyma, chest wall and respiratory muscles are all capable of causing a restrictive pattern. After reading this chapter, you should be able to: Use pulmonary function testing to distinguish between the different causes of a restrictive pattern. Describe the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of major intraparenchymal causes of a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. Describe the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of chest wall and pleural diseases associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. Describe the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of neuromuscular diseases associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing PHYSIOLOGY AND PULMONARY FUNCTION The hallmark of a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing is a decrease in total lung capacity (TLC). This can result from multiple mechanisms including (Table 11-1): Intrapulmonary problems: lung diseases that decrease compliance of the lung parenchyma Extrapulmonary problems: problems outside the lungs that limit expansion of the respiratory system including chest wall abnormalities, pleural space problems and weakness of the respiratory muscles Table 11-1: Examples of Diseases with a Restrictive Pattern on PFTs Clinical Examples Asbestosis Coal-workers pneumoconiosis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Sarcoidosis Kyphoscoliosis Large pleural mass (e.g., mesothelioma); Pleural effusion or thickening Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis Etiology Intrapulmonary causes of restriction (i.e., the problem resides in the lung) Extrapulmonary causes of restriction (i.e., the problem resides outside the lung)  11 1 \\nThe physiological changes and changes in pulmonary function are not consistent across diseases and, instead, can vary based on the underlying cause of the restrictive pattern. Nevertheless, some common patterns are present. Spirometry Because the vital capacity is reduced, the FEV1 is necessarily diminished (the lower the total volume exhaled, the less that comes out in the first second), but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. A pattern of low FEV1 and FVC with a normal ratio is suggestive of a restrictive process but the presence of restriction can only be confirmed by demonstrating a low TLC.In the absence of severe airflow obstruction, a reduced vital capacity is usually considered to reflect restriction, but this can only be confirmed by the reduced total lung capacity. Flow Rates Flow volume loops in restrictive diseases have a characteristic appearance compared to healthy individuals; the vital capacity (distance moved along the x- axis) is reduced while peak flow is often relatively preserved because airway function is unaffected. The airways are also tethered open by diffuse parenchymal processes (Figure 11-1). In more severe disease, peak expiratory flow may be reduced. Figure 11-1: Flow volume loops in restrictive disease. Peak expiratory flow tends to be preserved while distance moved along the x-axis (the vital capacity) is reduced Lung Volumes Tidal Volume (VT) Diseases associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing usually limit the ability of the patient to inhale. As a result, the tidal volume is typically reduced. Patients compensate for this and maintain adequate minute ventilation by increasing their respiratory rate. Total Lung Capacity (TLC) Restrictive processes are defined by a reduced total lung capacity. Mixed obstructive/restrictive disorders can be seen in which case the FEV1/FVC ratio and the TLC are both reduced. Residual Volume (RV) RV is decreased in parenchymal diseases because the decreased compliance tethers open airways and allows exhalation to a lower volume. In diffuse neuromuscular diseases that affect inspiratory and expiratory muscles, (eg amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) RV is normal or high as the patient cannot exhale and empty the chest as fully due to neuromuscular incompetence. RV is variable 2  11 \\nin diseases affecting the chest wall; some processes (e.g., kyphoscoliosis) lower RV but others (e.g., severely increased body mass index) cause early airway closure, mild air trapping and a slightly increased RV.Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) FRC, which is determined by the balance of recoil forces between the lung and chest wall, is usually reduced in parenchymal restrictive disease because lung elastic recoil is increased relative to chest wall recoil. In neuromuscular diseases, FRC is often normal or slightly decreased, as FRC is determined by the elastic properties of the lung and chest wall, which are not affected by the strength of the respiratory muscles. A comparison of the changes in TLC, RV and FRC with intraparenchymal causes of restriction and diffuse neuromuscular diseases are summarized in Figure 11-2. Figure 11-2: The spirogram in diseases with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. The dotted lines denote the FRC, TLC and RV in the normal healthy state. Note that in both categories of restrictive disease, the TLC and tidal volume are reduced. With intraparenchymal causes of restriction, FRC and RV are reduced while in diffuse neuromuscular disease, RV is normal or increased, while FRC remains normal. Compliance Respiratory system compliance is lower with parenchymal causes of restriction due to increased recoil of the lung parenchyma at all lung volumes. Because low lung compliance increases the elastic work of breathing to an abnormal extent at higher lung volumes, the work of tidal breathing is decreased at the lower FRC.For the same reason, these patients tend to breathe with a smaller tidal volume, but more rapid rate. Respiratory system compliance is variable in extrapulmonary causes of a restrictive pattern. In kyphoscoliosis and patients with a very high body mass index, chest wall compliance is reduced, leading to decreased compliance of the entire system. Respiratory system compliance is often unchanged in neuromuscular disease. Dead Space As noted above, the tidal volume is commonly reduced in disorders with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing. Because the volume of the anatomic dead space is relatively constant, the dead space fraction increases. Patients with intraparenchymal causes of restriction may also have an increase in 3  11 \\nalveolar dead space, causing a further increase in the dead space fraction. To maintain sufficient alveolar ventilation, patients must increase their respiratory rate to maintain sufficient minute ventilation. Depending on the severity of the patient\\'s restrictive process, this can be difficult to achieve and sustain. As a result, severe restrictive disease is often accompanied by hypercarbia. Diffusion Many intraparenchymal causes of restriction slow the process of diffusion by damaging capillaries and, thereby, limiting the surface for gas exchange and/or by thickening the alveolar-capillary barrier. (Figure 11-3). Figure 11-3: Slowing of diffusion in parenchymal causes of restriction. Due to thickening of the alveolar-capillary barrier or damage to pulmonary capillaries and loss of surface area for gas exchange, the rate of diffusion is slower than in a healthy individual. As long as the individual remains at rest, the capillary PO2 still has time to rise to the alveolar value. Due to the loss of surface area for gas exchange, these patients manifest a decreased diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) on pulmonary function testing. As noted in Chapter 6, however, the thickened alveolar-capillary barrier or loss of surface area for gas exchange does not cause hypoxemia if the individual remains at rest because there is adequate time for the capillary PO2 to rise up to the alveolar value. When a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing is due to an extra- pulmonary process, the underlying lung parenchyma is typically normal. As a result, the surface area for gas exchange and diffusion are unaffected. The DLCO is typically normal, but can be mildly decreased if the patient develops atelectasis related to their restrictive process. The Arterial Partial Pressure of Oxygen Hypoxemia is common with intra-parenchymal causes of restriction and largely results from VA/Q mismatching. This occurs because regional differences in compliance across the lung cause variation in ventilation across alveolar units leading to VA/Q heterogeneity. Hypoxemia typically worsens with exercise due to worsening of VA/Q matching. Diffusion limitation due to the shorter red cell transit time in the pulmonary capillaries may also play a role. Hypoxemia can also seen 4  11 \\nin extraparenchymal causes of restriction, but in these cases it is typically the result of hypoventilation. The Arterial Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide Despite difficulty inflating their respiratory system on inhalation, patients with an intraparenchymal cause of restriction often show chronic hyperventilation with low PaCO2 in the early stages of their disease. This is due to a combination of the hypoxic ventilatory response as well stimulation from other receptor systems (eg pulmonary stretch receptors, juxtacapillary receptors) that affect ventilatory control. In the advanced stages of many intrapulmonary causes of restriction, ventilatory failure supervenes and PaCO2 rises. Many patients with neuromuscular diseases and other extrapulmonary causes of restriction, such as severe kyphoscoliosis, also manifest chronic hypoventilation, due to an inability to maintain sufficient alveolar ventilation for their metabolic needs. Changes in the parameters described above are summarized in Table 11-2. The changes denoted in the table are general trends and exceptions can be seen due to the marked heterogeneity of diseases that cause restrictive patterns on pulmonary function testing. FRC is sometimes mildly decreased in neuromuscular disease ** PaCO2 can be increased in advanced forms of parenchymal causes of restriction DIFFUSE PARENCHYMAL LUNG DISEASES The intraparenchymal processes that cause a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing are referred to as diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). The term \"interstitial lung diseases (ILD)\" is frequently used but this term is not entirely accurate as some disease primarily affect the lung interstitium while others affect the alveolar spaces or both regions. While some DPLD are caused by exposure to inhaled materials (e.g., asbestosis) or are a manifestation of a systemic disorder (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) many have no clear cause and fall within the heading of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. An extensive review of all of these lung diseases is beyond the scope of this chapter but a categorization scheme is included in Figure 11-4. Do not memorize this figure. You are only responsible for the disorders covered in the remainder of this chapter.  11 5 \\nFigure 11-4: Diffuse parenchymal lung diseases Diagnostic Evaluation for Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease While there is no single approach to the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases, most cases are diagnosed using some or all of the following tools: Thorough history including a detailed occupational and exposure history dating back many years in the patient\\'s life Pulmonary function testing Plain chest radiography Chest CT scan (usually a high-resolution Chest CT) Lung biopsy (either transbronchial biopsy during bronchoscopy or a surgical lung biopsy). involving Lung biopsy but may not be necessary if the clinical picture and imaging are classic for a particular disease. Sorting through this information and arriving at the diagnosis requires a collaborative approach the pulmonologist, radiologist, pathologist and, in some cases, occupational medicine specialist. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Pulmonary fibrosis can develop as the end-stage of many idiopathic interstitial pneumonias but also develops without a clear inciting cause, in which case the patient is deemed to have \"idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\" (IPF), a specific and distinct clinical entity with characteristic clinical features limited to the lung. Epidemiology Although IPF can affect people at any age, it usually occurs in patients 50-70 years of age and is more common in males than females. Pathology The histopathologic pattern of IPF is termed \"usual interstitial pneumonia\" (UIP, Figure 11-5). Pathologic diagnosis of UIP requires temporally heterogeneous 6  11 \\npattern of fibroblastic foci, excessive collagen and extracellular matrix and cystic \"honeycombing\" in a peripheral and subpleural distribution. Figure 11-5: Histopathology of IPF demonstrating: (A) subepithelial fibroblastic foci (arrows) and (B) parenchymal heterogeneity (areas of normal lung on the right adjacent to areas with fibroblastic foci (arrows) and honeycombing (arrowheads). Clinical Features Symptoms and Signs: Symptoms have an insidious onset and progress over time. In addition to exertional dyspnea, which occurs in nearly all cases, patients may have a dry cough. Signs include fine, \"velcro-like\" end-inspiratory crackles at the lung bases and digital clubbing (Figure 11-6). Cyanosis due to severe hypoxemia can be seen in the late stages of the disease. Figure 11-6: Digital clubbing. Note: this is not specific for IPF and can be seen in other diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis. Pulmonary Function: FEV1 and FVC are reduced, but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal or high. DLCO is diminished. Resting arterial blood gases typically have an increased alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, which increases further with exercise. Early in the disease process, patients may have a low PaCO2 due to the hypoxic ventilatory response but in severe disease, they often have a chronically high PaCO2 due to inability to maintain adequate alveolar ventilation due to abnormal lung mechanics. Chest Imaging: Chest radiographs (Figure 11-7A) show low lung volumes and reticular opacities predominantly in the lung bases. Rarely, patients with early stages of IPF have normal chest radiographs despite having dyspnea on exertion or evidence of UIP on lung biopsy. High-resolution chest CT (HRCT) is the imaging modality of choice to assess the nature and extent of disease. Typical findings  11 7 \\ninclude cystic honeycombing, reticular opacities, and traction bronchiectasis that are typically in the subpleural and basilar lung regions (Figure 11-7B). Figure 11-7: Chest imaging in IPF.Panel A: Plain chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and reticular (net-like) opacities; Panel B: Chest CT image: Black arrows point to areas of honeycombing just beneath the pleural surface. White arrows point to airways pulled open by surrounding fibrosis (traction bronchiectasis). Diagnosis The diagnosis is considered in patients with characteristic signs and symptoms, a restrictive pattern on PFTs and typical radiographic findings and can be confirmed with HRCT and surgical lung biopsy. A thorough history to exclude infectious, environmental or systemic diseases and drug causes is essential to rule out diagnoses that may be amenable to treatment. Biopsy is not always required if the clinical picture and imaging are consistent with IPF.Treatment The prognosis in IPF is very poor with a median survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. The cause of death is usually respiratory and/or right heart failure, heralded by the onset of hypercapnia and cor pulmonale. While there are no medication regimens that reverse fibrosis or improve mortality, the anti-fibrotic agent, pirfenidone, and the tyrosine-kinase inhibitor, nintedanib, have been shown to slow the decline lung in transplantation. Sarcoidosis Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis, whose histopathologic hallmark is granulomatous inflammation. Pulmonary and thoracic lymph node involvement is present in nearly 90% of cases although the heart, central nervous system, liver, spleen, skin, and eyes may also be affected. Epidemiology Sarcoidosis occurs more frequently in females. For unclear reasons, it is more common in Black Americans than white Americans but is rare in individuals from Africa, Southeast Asia or the India subcontinent. There is also geographic variation with fewer cases in tropical areas compared to temperate areas. function. Selected patients may benefit lung from 8  11 \\nPathology Studies of bronchoalveolar lavage samples suggest activated macrophages and T-lymphocytes release mediators that recruit monocytes, stimulate fibroblast proliferation, and induce T-cell replication that cause the granuloma formation and fibrosis that are the pathologic features of sarcoidosis. The characteristic lesion in sarcoid is the non-caseating granuloma (Figure 11-8) whose presence on any biopsy specimen should always prompt consideration of this diagnosis. Because non-caseating granulomas are non-specific, other potential causes must be considered as well (eg hypersensitivity pneumonitis). The granulomas may evolve over time leading to fibrosis of the lung. Figure 11-8: Non-caseating granulomas Clinical Features Pulmonary Symptoms and Signs: While the most common respiratory symptoms are dyspnea and non-productive cough, about 50% of patients are asymptomatic and only come to attention due to an abnormal chest radiograph demonstrating bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (Figure 11-9). The examination is usually normal but may reveal tachypnea, crackles, and rarely wheezing. Extrapulmonary Symptoms and Signs: Non-specific symptoms of fatigue, malaise, weight loss and arthralgias are common. Some individuals present acutely with arthralgias, fever and erythema nodosum associated with bilateral hilar adenopathy (Lofgren\\'s Syndrome). The presence of erythema nodosum is associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous regression of the disease. Other extrapulmonary lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, arthritis, skin (uveitis, chorioretinitis), myocardial involvement (usually identified by arrhythmias or conduction blocks) and central nervous system findings. Pulmonary Function: There is no single PFT pattern in sarcoidosis. The DLCO is characteristically reduced and may be the only abnormality in early stage disease. A restrictive pattern is frequently present when parenchymal opacities develop. Coexisting airflow obstruction (low FEV1/FVC) may also be seen. include: generalized findings lesions, eye involvement  11 9 \\nChest Imaging: The classic radiographic finding is symmetrical bilateral hilar adenopathy without pulmonary parenchymal involvement (Stage I disease, Figure 11-9). This finding is highly suggestive of sarcoidosis in the asymptomatic patient but in symptomatic patients you must consider other entities such as lymphoma, tuberculosis, fungal infections, and metastatic carcinoma. Figure 11-9: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy in a patient with sarcoidosis. With no evidence of lung parenchymal involvement, this patient would be labeled as having Stage I sarcoidosis. Stage II sarcoidosis has bilateral hilar adenopathy with diffuse parenchymal reticular and/or nodular opacities. In stage III disease, there is diffuse pulmonary involvement without hilar adenopathy. Extensive scarring may result in fibrosis (stage IV), which is not radiographically distinguishable from fibrosis due to other causes. Even though we refer to \"stages\" of disease based on the radiographic findings, patients do not naturally progress from lower to higher stages. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on a characteristic clinical picture, typical radiographic findings, demonstration of non-caseating granulomas on biopsy and the exclusion of other diseases. Biopsies can be obtained by bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, surgical lung biopsy or from other affected organs. Acute Lofgren\\'s syndrome is an exception to this approach and can be diagnosed without the aid of biopsy. Bronchoalveolar lavage often reveals an increased CD4+:CD8+ ratio of T-cells. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) levels can be measured but have little diagnostic utility. Treatment Sarcoidosis resolves spontaneously in up to 90% of patients presenting with stage I disease (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy alone). Overall, 30-40% of patients achieve clinical remission over 1 month to 2 years, while 33% have chronic symptoms and radiograph changes and others have chronic, severe pulmonary involvement. Because of the high rate of spontaneous remission, asymptomatic Stage I or Stage II patients usually do not require treatment. Patients with severe or worsening pulmonary symptoms, worsening pulmonary function or extrapulmonary involvement (excluding Lofgren\\'s Syndrome) are started on therapy, the mainstay of which is systemic corticosteroids. Note: Berylliosis is an occupational lung disease that resembles sarcoid clinically and should be considered when a sarcoid-like picture is seen in patients who 10  11 \\nworked in the nuclear or electronics industries. In Washington State, this is seen in people who used to work at the Hanford nuclear reservation. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HSP) is a parenchymal lung disease that occurs after inhalation of finely dispersed organic dusts or, less commonly, certain low molecular weight chemicals and drugs. While often reversible, it may lead to irreversible fibrosis depending on the amount, frequency and duration of antigen exposure, the nature of the inhaled dust and the patient\\'s immune response. Pathophysiology and Pathology The vast majority of individuals exposed to inhaled allergens are asymptomatic, even though many develop an antibody response, suggesting that in addition to the environmental factors, host factors affect pathogenesis. The antigens are usually small enough to deposit in the peripheral airways and alveoli, although the absorption of soluble antigens from larger particles deposited more proximally may also play a role. Some etiologic agents implicated in HSP are listed in Table 11-2 (you do not need to memorize these antigens for this course). The most important of these are the thermophylic actinomycetes and bird droppings. Thermophylic actinomycetes are bacteria of less than 1 um in size with the morphology of fungi found in the soil, grains, compost, fresh water, and in moisture accumulations in forced air heating and cooling systems, humidifiers and air conditioning systems. Serum proteins from dried excreta of a variety of birds may be inhaled, causing illness in individuals with close contact with the birds on a chronic basis. Table 11-2. Selected organic dusts causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis Disease Farmer\\'s lung Pneumonitis due to contaminated forced air systems Sequoiosis Bird fancier\\'s lung Cheese washer\\'s lung Dust Inhaled Moldy Hay Dust from contaminated furnace or air conditioner Redwood dust Avian dust Cheese particles Antigen(s) Micropolyspora faeni Thermoactinomyces vulgaris Micropolyspora faeni Thermoactinomyces vulgaris Graphium species Avian proteins Penicillium casei The pathologic hallmark of subacute and chronic HSP is granulomatous inflammation, characterized by prominent, often patchy infiltrates that usually begin near the terminal bronchioles, but may extend widely into the interstitium and alveoli. Non-caseating granulomas are often seen but are more loosely formed and have a different distribution than those seen in sarcoidosis. Clinical Features The clinical features are usually similar regardless of the particular inhaled dust. Acute HSP: Respiratory and systemic symptoms occur 4-8 hours after exposure, persist for several hours, and then remit with removal of the offending antigen. Episodes recur with repeated exposure to the offending antigen. Common 11  11 \\nsymptoms include cough, dyspnea, fever/chills, malaise, and myalgias that are often mistaken for bacterial or viral pneumonia. Physical exam reveals an acutely ill, dyspneic, febrile patient and, often, bibasilar crackles. Chronic HSP: occurs with prolonged low level antigen exposure and can lead to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. In such cases, disability may progress even after patients are no longer exposed to the causative agent. In the chronic form, there is progressive dyspnea, chronic cough, malaise, and weight loss. Patients may have crackles on lung examination, and clubbing may be present. Diagnostic Testing Pulmonary Function: Acute and chronic HSP cause restrictive physiology on PFTs but can also show obstructive defects. DLCO is often decreased due to the parenchymal involvement. Chest Imaging: In acute HSP, patchy ill-defined parenchymal opacities are usually present and are occasionally accompanied by pleural effusion. Chest radiographs are often normal between episodes. HRCT usually shows ground glass opacities in a centrilobular distribution with upper lobe predominance (Figure 11-10). In chronic HSP, the chest radiograph typically demonstrates interstitial (net-like, reticular) opacities while HRCT findings include volume loss, reticular opacities, and cystic honeycombing that resemble IPF.Figure 11-10: Chest CT (HRCT) in acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The lung parenchyma has a heterogeneous appearance. The whiter areas represent are called \"ground-glass opacities\" which signify an alveolar-filling process. Confirming the Diagnosis: Diagnosis of acute or chronic HSP relies on a careful history including a detailed environmental and occupational exposure history. It is possible to test for specific precipitating antibodies for the suspected offending agent but these tests lack specificity as antibodies to particular antigens may be found in up to 50% of asymptomatic individuals. The most direct means of diagnosing acute HSP is reproducing the clinical syndrome and/or pulmonary function abnormalities with re-exposure to the suspected sensitizing agent. For example, recurrence of symptoms with return to work or improvement in symptoms with removal of a potential offending agent (e.g., bird in the home) support the diagnosis. In rare cases, provocative inhalation challenge to the antigen in question can be performed in a controlled, laboratory 12  11 \\nsetting. Chronic HSP is more difficult to diagnose as histologic examination at this stage may show only nonspecific lung fibrosis. Treatment The mainstay of treatment for HSP is removal/avoidance of the offending antigen. Corticosteroids are recommended in acute, severe and progressive disease but may not help if the inciting agent is not eliminated. Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease Due to Collagen Vascular Diseases Many collagen vascular diseases (CVD), such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis and dermatomyositis/polymyositis have pulmonary manifestations, including diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), pleural effusions, pulmonary nodules or pulmonary hypertension. Respiratory symptoms may even occur before patients develop other symptoms or signs of their rheumatologic disorder. The histopathologic appearance is highly variable. Respiratory symptoms and signs vary based on the particular CVD and its pulmonary manifestation. Because the clinical picture is similar to many DPLD, diagnostic strategies are similar but also include serologic testing to identify a particular CVD.Treatment focuses on immunomodulatory agents and may be somewhat more effective than when used in the idiopathic respiratory diseases. OCCUPATIONAL PARENCHYMAL LUNG DISEASES Certain occupations are associated acute and chronic exposures to inorganic dusts that can cause diffuse parenchymal lung disease, referred to as pneumoconiosis. A few of the these are summarized below and in Table 11-3. Asbestosis There are four manifestations of asbestos exposure in the respiratory system: 1) interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis); 2) pleural disease (asbestos plaques or effusion); 3) bronchogenic carcinoma; and 4) mesothelioma. Asbestosis is discussed here. Epidemiology The most common pneumoconiosis, asbestosis is caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers, naturally occurring fibers that have enjoyed widespread industrial use due to their resilient properties (insulation, fireproofing materials, brake pads). The lag between exposure and fibrosis can be over 20-30 years. The exact incidence is unknown, but due to increasingly stringent regulation of asbestos use beginning 40-50 years ago, it is thought to be decreasing. Occupational Exposure Key exposures include shipbuilding and repair; brake lining work, insulation and textiles, stone polishing and cutting.  11 13 \\nTable 11-3: Major Occupational Lung Diseases Disease Asbestosis Berylliosis Coal Worker\\'s Pneumoconiosis Silicosis Classic Exposures Shipbuilding and repair; work with brake linings, insulation and textiles, stone polishing and cutting Metal alloy manufacturing; defense and nuclear industries (eg Hanford), electronics, ceramics Coal Mining; graphite mining and milling Work with abrasives, ceramics and stone including sandblasting, masonry, grinding and polishing, mining and excavating Clinical Features Radiographic Findings Variable: asymptomatic pleural plaques, pleural effusions, mesothelioma and pulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis) Closely resembles sarcoid except patients generally lack extra- pulmonary manifestations May be asymptomatic in simple/early disease; Dyspnea develops in patients with progressive massive fibrosis May be asymptomatic in simple/early disease; Dyspnea that develops over months in acute forms and over years in more chronic forms Calcified pleural plaques seen in isolation or in along with basilar reticular opacities, pleural effusions or masses Poorly defined nodular opacities. Hilar adenopathy seen in less than half of cases Small founded opacities (\"coal macules\") in upper lung zones that can coalesce into progressive massive fibrosis Simple silicosis: small, round opacities in the upper lung fields; Progressive Massive Fibrosis: larger, confluent opacities; May see lymphadenopathy with egg-shell calcification toxic effect, causing pneumocytes or macrophages Pathophysiology and Pathology Inhaled asbestos fibers deposit in the lower respiratory tract, where they likely have a direct to release inflammatory mediators, reactive oxygen species, and free radicals that cause cell injury and can lead to progressive fibrosis. On histopathology, asbestos or \"ferruginous\" bodies (iron coated fibers) may be present (Figure 11-11), but due to sampling errors, the absence of asbestos bodies or fibers does not exclude the diagnosis. As in IPF, asbestosis often demonstrates a UIP pattern of injury. Figure 11-11: Ferruginous bodies in asbestosis. Asbestos fibers become coated with iron and calcium. The fibers are demonstrated in this image with an iron stain. Image source: webpath.med.utah.edu Clinical Features Respiratory symptoms occur many years after exposure and resemble those of IPF.Chest radiographs reveal bilateral patchy reticular opacities with associated calcified pleural plaques. End-stage asbestosis may be radiographically indistinguishable from IPF.PFTs show a restrictive pattern; however, an isolated low DLCO is often the earliest finding. 14  11 \\nfor Diagnosis A history of asbestos exposure coupled with typical clinical and radiographic findings is critical to making the diagnosis of asbestosis. Although lung biopsy can be helpful in diagnosing asbestosis, a reasonable diagnosis can be made on the basis of history, signs/symptoms, and chest imaging. Treatment As with IPF, there is no effective treatment for asbestosis. Most importantly, patients should be monitored the development of asbestos-related malignancies, including mesothelioma and bronchogenic carcinoma. Silicosis Silicosis refers to pulmonary disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica, the most abundant mineral on earth, found in rocks such as slate and sandstone. Occupational Exposure The key exposure is work with abrasives, ceramics and stone, including sandblasting, masonry, polishing and grinding, mining, and tunneling. Pathophysiology and Pathology Inhaled silica particles deposit in the alveoli, where they are engulfed by alveolar macrophages, resulting in cytokine release, free radical generation, inflammation, cell death and eventually fibrosis. The pathologic hallmark of silicosis is the silicotic nodule (Figure 11-12). It contains a central zone of hyaline and collagen and a peripheral zone containing macrophages, lymphocytes and collagen that is the site of active inflammation and nodule progression. Figure 11-12: A silicotic nodule Clinical Features Patients with massive exposure can develop \"acute silicosis\" marked by dyspnea and constitutional symptoms such as weight loss and fatigue. With lower levels of exposure, the disease is indolent and may take years to present. Some patients have abnormal chest radiographs but lack symptoms or objective evidence of pulmonary dysfunction (referred to as \"simple silicosis\") while other patients present with progressive dyspnea and chronic cough. In many cases, patients progress to a chronic, severe disease referred to as \"chronic silicosis\" or \"progressive massive fibrosis.\" PFTs often show a mixed obstructive/restrictive pattern (low FEV1/FVC and low TLC). Three radiographic patterns are seen with the different types of silica exposure: Acute silicosis: Basilar-predominant, alveolar opacities  11 15 \\n  Simple silicosis: Small, upper lobe-predominant nodules Chronic silicosis / progressive massive fibrosis: Larger opacities with upper lobe fibrosis (Figure 11-13); hilar adenopathy and calcification (often with an egg-shell pattern). Figure 11-13: Chronic Silicosis. The plain radiograph demonstrates large confluent opacities in the middle to upper lung zones. Diagnosis The radiographic pattern along with appropriate clinical exposure and absence of another likely diagnosis is sufficient for diagnosis. Lung biopsy has limited value. Treatment Unfortunately, no standard therapy for silicosis exists. Care is supportive with emphasis on avoiding further silica exposure. Coal Worker\\'s Pneumoconiosis (CWP, \"Black Lung Disease\") CWP occurs due to carbon dust inhalation. Because coal dust is a mixture of silica and carbon, silica exposure may be a major factor in disease pathogenesis. The risk of CWP increases with amount and duration of exposure. Following a steep decline in incidence beginning in the 1970s, there has been a recent large increase in the number of cases, likely related to changes in mining practices and the absence of sufficient changes in miner safety regulations. https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/announcement/frontline-npr-investigate-the- rise-of-severe-black-lung-disease-in-coals-deadly-dust/ Occupational Exposure The key exposures are coal mining, graphite mining and milling. Pathophysiology Coal particles deposit in the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles, causing localized inflammation. Macules composed of macrophages and fibroblasts form, leading to fibrosis and, potentially, emphysematous changes. Clinical Features Like silicosis, CWP can present as \"simple\" disease with few symptoms, little to no pulmonary impairment and small upper lobe nodules on chest radiograph. CWP also progresses to chronic disease with symptoms of progressive dyspnea and chronic cough and large, confluent opacities on chest radiography. PFTs may show a mixed obstructive/restrictive defect with low DLCO and hypoxemia. 16  11 \\nDiagnosis CWP diagnosed based on clinical features and biopsy is not required. If performed for diagnostic purposes, biopsies may show coal dust macules and nodules (Figure 11-14). Figure 11-14: Coal Dust Macule. The black material within the nodule is anthracotic pigment. It is normally not fibrogenic but when inhaled in large quantities can stimulate a fibrotic response. Small lesions are referred to as coal macules while larger lesions are called nodules. Treatment Care is supportive with an emphasis on avoiding further exposure. EXTRAPULMONARY CAUSES OF RESTRICTION ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTING Chest Wall Abnormalities - Kyphoscoliosis A restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing can result from any process that makes the chest wall less distensible thus decreasing the compliance of the respiratory system. Kyphoscoliosis is the illustrative example discussed below. Individuals with markedly increased BMI can also develop restrictive physiology and chronic hypoventilation. This diagnosis is considered in Chapter 8. Pathophysiology Kyphoscoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine both anteriorly (kyphosis) and laterally (scoliosis) (Figure 11-15) The deformity stiffens the chest wall, impairing movement of the ribs on inhalation and altering lung mechanics. Figure 11-15: Severe kyphoscoliosis. The same patient is shown in Panels A and B.In Panel B, the white lines denote the position of the ribs while the dotted black line highlights the position of the cervical and thoracic spine.  11 17 \\nAs with all restrictive diseases, patients have a decreased TLC.FRC is decreased due to the change in the balance of recoil forces while RV is generally preserved. With advancing age, the risk of chronic hypoventilation increases as chest wall compliance continues to decrease. Smaller tidal breaths also result in an increase dead-space fraction, which predisposes to hypercarbia. While DLCO is generally normal, patients are at risk for hypoxemia due to hypoventilation and/or low VA/Q due to basilar atelectasis from an inability to take deep breaths. Clinical Features The diagnosis is generally made based on physical exam. Severe kyphoscoliosis leads to an increased work of breathing, decreased tidal volumes and a compensatory increase in the respiratory rate (rapid-shallow breathing). Treatment While braces or surgery are used for children or adolescents, the more severe form seen in older age is rarely amenable to either intervention. The mainstay of management is treatment of chronic hypoventilation and support of work-of- breathing with non-invasive ventilation. Pleural Diseases Processes that affect the pleura or fill the pleural space can cause a restrictive pattern. Inflammation due to infection or connective tissue disease can result in thickened and less compliant pleura, while pleural tumors (e.g., mesothelioma) and large pleural effusions can limit the lung expansion enough to decrease TLC.These disorders are discussed in Chapter 12. Neuromuscular Diseases Diseases that weaken or paralyze the diaphragm, as well as those which affect the accessory muscles of respiration, can cause restrictive pathophysiology. Processes can be categorized into those that solely affect the diaphragm and those that are more global. The more common of these are listed in Table 11-4. Table 11-4: Neuromuscular disorders causing a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing 18 Site of dysfunction Nervous system Neuromuscular junction Muscle Clinical examples Phrenic nerve injury Guillain-Barre syndrome Poliomyelitis Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Spinal cord injury Myasthenia gravis Post-polio syndrome Muscular dystrophy  11 \\nSystemic Neuromuscular Disease Pathophysiology A restrictive pattern can result both from weakness of the diaphragm or loss of chest wall and abdominal muscle tone causing a less compliant \"chest wall.\" TLC is decreased but unlike other causes of a restrictive pattern, patients with neuromuscular weakness often have a normal or high RV as they lack the strength to exhale to a very low volume. FRC is usually closer to normal than in other causes of restriction but can be slightly decreased due to either a stiffer chest wall or basilar parenchymal disease secondary to chronic aspiration. Clinical Features While patients may develop dyspnea, most have other signs of weakness. The constellation of symptoms, onset and progression of weakness and associated symptoms help diagnose the specific disease. Patients have low tidal volumes but are often unable to adequately increase respiratory rate to maintain adequate ventilation. For this reason, patients with neuromuscular weakness are predisposed to developing chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure. Pulmonary Function Testing When neuromuscular disease is suspected, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP) are measured to assess for decreased strength. Diaphragmatic Weakness Pathophysiology Unilateral diaphragmatic weakness or even paralysis is often asymptomatic, while bilateral weakness results in a restrictive pattern. Unilateral changes are usually due to disruption of the phrenic nerve conduction either due to trauma or a mediastinal mass. Bilateral weakness or paralysis is more commonly due to systemic disease or high spinal cord injury. Clinical Features Patients develop dyspnea and often report that it is worse in the supine position (\"orthopnea\") because the abdominal contents move up towards and compress the thorax and cannot be pushed in a caudal direction on inspiration due to the weakness of the diaphragm. Diagnosis Diaphragmatic weakness can be confirmed by performing spirometry in the upright and supine positions. A greater than 20% decrease in FVC when supine is consistent with diaphragmatic disease. When unilateral diaphragm paralysis is suspected (usually due to an elevated hemi-diaphragm on chest radiograph) diaphragm motion can be assessed with a \"sniff test\", in which the diaphragms are visualized under fluoroscopy to see whether they move in the same or opposite directions with inhalation. Electromyography of the diaphragm is used to diagnosis bilateral disease. Treatment Unilateral diaphragm weakness, if symptomatic, can be treated with diaphragmatic plication: a surgery that fixes the diaphragm in a flattened position. There are few interventions to help bilateral diaphragmatic weakness/paralysis. Nerve 19  11 \\nstimulators can be tried in patients with spinal cord injury, but are not widely used in other situations. Non-invasive ventilation can be used in selected patients to support ventilation during sleep. 20  11 \\nChapter 12 Pleural Disorders INTRODUCTION The space between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura normally contains only a few milliliters of fluid, whose purpose is to lubricate the pleural surfaces and facilitate their movement relative to each other. In some diseases, however, fluid, air, masses or fibrotic tissue occupy this space and impair pulmonary function. This chapter describes normal pleural fluid dynamics and the main forms of pleural disease. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Describe normal pleural fluid dynamics and how these processes are altered Identify pleural effusion and pneumothoraces on a plain chest radiographs Interpret pleural fluid studies to distinguish between transudative and exudative in disease states effusions Describe pneumothorax mesothelioma the clinical presentation and risk factors for spontaneous Identify the signs and describe the pathophysiology of tension pneumothorax Describe to the epidemiology, presentation and diagnostic approach THE \"NORMAL\" PLEURAL SPACE Pleural space anatomy was discussed in the HFF lab on the Lungs and Pleural Space. With normal hemodynamic pressures, pleural fluid is formed predominantly by the systemically perfused parietal pleura and absorbed by lymphatics in the parietal pleura and, to a lesser extent, the visceral pleura. Movement of fluid into the pleural space is governed by the balance between the rates of filtration into and absorption from the pleural space. The parietal pleural may produce up to several liters of fluid per day but, in normal individuals, the Starling forces and lymphatic drainage are such that there are only a few milliliters of fluid in the pleural space at any time. Small amounts of protein also enter the pleural space and are generally removed by the lymphatic system as well. PLEURAL EFFUSIONS The term \"pleural effusion\" refers to the accumulation of fluid in the space between the visceral and parietal pleura. Pathophysiology Normal pleural fluid dynamics is disrupted by one of four mechanisms: (1) increased systemic or pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure; (2) decreased colloid osmotic pressure; (3) increased pleural capillary permeability; and (4) lymphatic obstruction. Fluid can accumulate in one or both pleural cavities (unilateral or bilateral effusions). Effusions alter pulmonary function by compressing adjacent lung and impairing ventilation of the affected area. Some effusions are small and of little significance while others are very large (up to several liters of fluid) and have a substantial impact on pulmonary function.  12 1 \\nEtiology There are two broad categories of pleural effusions. Transudates are collections of fluid, which accumulate passively as the result of increased hydrostatic pressure or decreased colloid osmotic pressure. Exudates are effusions that occur due to inflammation of the pleural surfaces, increased capillary permeability or lymphatic obstruction. Some of the many conditions leading to effusions in each of these categories are listed in Table 12-1. In some cases, the cause of the effusion is obvious (e.g., bilateral effusions in heart failure) while in other cases, the cause is not apparent and diagnostic procedures are necessary. Table 12-1. Examples of Transudative and Exudative Effusions Transudates Exudates (not an exhaustive list) Congestive heart failure Nephrotic syndrome Hypoalbuminemia Constrictive pericarditis Hepatic hydrothorax Parapneumonic effusion Tuberculous pleurisy Esophageal perforation Rheumatoid pleurisy Pancreatitis Malignancy Lupus pleuritis Clinical Presentation The presentation of pleural effusions varies based on the size of the effusion and whether they are bilateral or unilateral. Patients often complain of dyspnea on exertion or, with large effusions, dyspnea at rest. Small effusions may be asymptomatic. Chest pain - often pleuritic - is another common feature, particularly if the effusion is due to an inflammatory or infectious process. Fevers are uncommon unless the effusion is due to an infection in the pleural space (e.g., empyema) or the underlying disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosis) is associated with fever. On physical examination, patients typically have dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the area of the effusion. Egophany may be heard at the upper margin of the effusion. Diagnosis Most large, simple effusions are easily seen on chest radiographs. They create dense homogeneous opacities that obscure the hemidiaphragm and adjacent structures. The opacity also commonly has what is referred to as the \"meniscus sign\" caused by the fact that a fluid column is formed when the patient is in the upright position (Figure 12-1). Other radiographic appearances are possible but are beyond the scope of this course. Ultrasound can also be used to confirm the presence of effusion (Figure 12-2). After identifying an effusion on chest imaging, the next step in the diagnostic work- up is to sample the fluid with a needle. This procedure, known as thoracentesis, is described further in Appendix 12-1 (optional material) and is typically done with ultrasound guidance. After nothing the appearance of the fluid, which may offer diagnostic clues to the cause of the effusion, the fluid is sent for measurement of the cell count and differential, LDH and total protein. Serum LDH and protein levels are also checked at the same time. If there is a suspicion for infection, the fluid should also be sent for Gram stain and appropriate cultures. 2  12 \\n Figure 12-1: Radiographic Appearance of a Pleural Effusion. On the right, there is a large effusion obscuring the right hemidiaphragm and right heart border. The top of the opacity has a U-shape. This is the \"meniscus sign.\" There is also a smaller effusion on the left that obscures the left hemidiaphragm and blunts the left costophrenic recess. Figure 12-2: Ultrasound Appearance of a Pleural Effusion. Pleural fluid is dark on ultrasound unlike the white/ opaque appearance on plain chest radiograph. The lung is echo-dense in this image due to the fact that it is being compressed by the fluid (atelectasis) The first priority is to determine whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate, as this distinction guides further workup and management. A pleural effusion is considered an exudate if ANY one of three criteria is met: Pleural fluid LDH > 2/3 the upper limit of normal for the serum LDH The ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH is greater than 0.6 The ratio of pleural fluid protein to serum protein is greater than 0.5 These are referred to as Light\\'s criteria and are named after the pulmonologist who developed them. Pleural fluid cholesterol > 45 mg/dL is another criterion separate from Light\\'s criteria for labeling pleural fluid as an exudate. Once the fluid is determined to be an exudate or transudate additional studies are performed as needed to sort through the differential diagnosis. These studies and their potential uses include:  12 3 \\nCell Count and Differential: A red blood cell count (RBC) >100,000/mL is seen in trauma (hemothorax), pulmonary embolism and carcinoma while counts less than that are of no significance (as little as 5,000 - 10,000 RBC/mL make the fluid appear red). A high leukocyte count with a high percentage of neutrophils is suggestive of infection while a high percentage of lymphocytes (> 65-80%) has a narrow differential including TB pleurisy, chylothorax, malignancy (lymphoma, lung cancer), sarcoidosis and rheumatoid pleurisy. High eosinophil counts are not generally useful in pleural fluid and are most commonly seen when blood or air have entered the pleural space. pH and Glucose. A very low pH (<7.3 with a normal blood pH) or glucose <60 mg/dL are seen with rheumatoid pleurisy, empyema, TB pleurisy, lupus pleuritis or esophageal rupture. Triglyceride levels >110 mg/dL are seen in chylothorax, a process in which disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct leads to accumulation of lymph fluid in the pleural space. The fluid typically has a milky appearance due to the presence of chylomicrons in the fluid. Amylase can be found in pleural fluid in acute or chronic pancreatitis, esophageal perforation or malignancy. Cytology is requested if there is a suspicion of malignancy. Treatment of Pleural Effusions Treatment depends on the cause and the severity of the patient\\'s symptoms. In many cases, treatment of the underlying disease leads to improvement. For example, improving the volume status of a patient with heart failure using diuretics decreases the size of the effusions. In other cases, therapeutic thoracentesis is performed to drain large amounts of fluid. If the underlying process causing the effusion is still present, however, the fluid can re-accumulate. In some cases, a catheter is placed through the chest wall (tube thoracostomy) for continued drainage or the pleural surfaces are fused together (pleurodesis) to obliterate the space between the pleural layers and prevent fluid re-accumulation. PNEUMOTHORAX The presence of air in the pleural space is referred to as a pneumothorax. Air can enter this space via one of two mechanisms: (1) a penetrating injury of the chest wall that allows air to track from the atmosphere to the pleural space or (2) rupture of an alveolus or intrapulmonary air space (e.g., bleb or bullae) into the pleural space. Pneumothorax can cause partial or total lung collapse depending on the size of the air collection and other factors and, in some cases, has important hemodynamic consequences. Pathophysiology Two physiologic consequences result from pneumothorax. First, total lung capacity and, therefore, vital capacity are reduced. Second, PaO2 is reduced due to areas VA/Q mismatch and shunt. People with good underlying lung function can tolerate the change in vital capacity without adverse consequences, while pneumothoraces in patients with underlying lung disease (e.g., COPD) can cause alveolar hypoventilation and hypoxemia. In most cases, air enters the pleural space in a  12 4 \\nsingle, time-limited event. If air continues to enter the space with no means of exit, however, pleural pressure increases to the point that the mediastinal structures are pushed to the other side of the chest. This leads to compression of the superior and inferior vena cavae and the right side of the heart, leading to poor venous return, impaired cardiac filling and, eventually decreased cardiac output and systemic blood pressure. This situation, referred to as tension pneumothorax, is a life-threatening emergency (Figure 12-3). Figure 12-3: Tension Pneumothorax. There is a large pneumothorax on the left as evidenced by the lucency on that side. The heart and mediastinal structures are pushed to the right side of the chest. The left hemidiaphragm is also flattened and pushed down much further than the right diaphragm due to the increased pressure in the left pleural space. While the radiograph provides clues to this diagnosis, ideally, tension pneumothorax is diagnosed based on clinical criteria before the radiograph is even performed. Treatment is immediate needle compression followed by chest tube placement. Etiology Iatrogenic (i.e., caused by the medical provider): This is the most common form of pneumothorax and occurs when a needle inadvertently punctures the lung parenchyma during procedures such central venous catheter placement. Traumatic pneumothoraces include those caused by penetrating trauma (e.g., a gunshot wound to the chest) or blunt/non-penetrating trauma (e.g., motor vehicle collision). In non-penetrating trauma, a rib fracture may puncture the lung tissue, but in the majority of cases, rib fractures are not present and alveolar rupture occurs due to sudden compression of the chest with a closed glottis. In such cases, air that ruptures out of the alveolar space can also track along the bronchovascular bundle to the mediastinum, causing pneumomediastinum. In both iatrogenic and traumatic pneumothorax, blood as well as air may enter the pleural space, producing a hemopneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothoraces occur without a precipitating event. These are subdivided by the absence or presence of an acute or chronic lung disease. Primary spontaneous: The patient has no underlying lung disease. Pneumothorax occurs when a subpleural bleb or cyst ruptures into the pleural space. Why these blebs develop is not clear, although smoking is recognized as a risk factor. The classic presentation is that of a tall, thin adolescent male who develops sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain.  12 5 \\n Secondary spontaneous: The patient has an underlying lung disease in which blebs, bullae or cysts form and predispose to pneumothorax. Lung diseases known to be associated with pneumothorax include COPD, cystic fibrosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). Clinical Presentation and Diagnosis Non-traumatic pneumothoraces usually present with the sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain and, often, dyspnea. With large pneumothoraces, hyper-resonance to percussion and diminished breath sounds may be present on the affected side. Hypoxemia may occur depending on the size of the pneumothorax and the presence of underlying lung disease. In tension pneumothorax, patients have tachycardia, hypotension, elevated neck veins, hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side and tracheal deviation away from the affected side. Diagnosis is classically made by chest radiography. Large pneumothoraces are easily visualized as an area of hyperlucency next to a collapsed lung (Figure 12- 4), while smaller ones may be more difficult to see (Figure 12-5). If initial imaging is unclear but suspicion still exists for the diagnosis, you can order expiratory chest radiographs as exhalation decreases lung volumes and accentuates the pneumothorax. Alternatively, a non-contrast chest CT may demonstrate small or unusually located air collections. Chest ultrasound is increasingly being used as a diagnostic tool as well, particularly in the emergency department, with the key finding in pneumothorax being the absence of sliding between the visceral and parietal pleura (Resources on chest ultrasound are in the appendix at the end of this chapter). Tension pneumothorax is often (and should be!) diagnosed at the bedside based on clinical factors before a chest radiograph is even performed. Figure 12-4: An Obvious Pneumo- thorax. There is a large area of lucency on the right representing air in the pleural space. The lung has collapsed towards the hilum. Note that despite the large size of the pneumothorax, the heart and mediastinal structures have not shifted to the other side of the chest and the patient likely does not have tension physiology. 6  12 \\nFigure 12-5: A Subtle Pneumothorax. The pneumothorax is not easily seen in Panel A.Panel B is a coned down view of the upper left chest showing the pneumothorax. The white arrows point to the pleural line. Above and to the right of that line is an area of lucency due to air in the pleural space. Treatment Treatment depends on the etiology of the pneumothorax and the patient\\'s clinical status. In general, patients with secondary spontaneous, traumatic or large pneumothoraces require a drainage procedure with a tube placed between the ribs to remove the air from the pleural cavity. Any unstable patient and, in particular, anyone with a tension pneumothorax must also have this immediately drained with needle decompression followed by placement of a chest tube. Stable patients with small primary spontaneous or iatrogenic pneumothoraces may be observed and forego drainage provided the pneumothorax does not enlarge. Patients with recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces are generally referred to a surgeon for a procedure (e.g., pleurodesis, stapling of blebs) to decrease the risk of recurrence. TUMORS OF THE PLEURA There are two categories of tumors that affect the pleural space: Metastatic Pleural Disease Referred to as \"secondary\" pleural tumors, metastatic disease to the pleural space represents the leading form of pleural malignancy, with lung cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma being the three most common cancers that spread to this space. These tumors usually cause pleural effusions by both increasing the entry and decreasing the exit of fluid from the pleural space. Affected patients typically present with dyspnea, while cough and chest pain (described as a dull ache) may also be present. While the size of malignant effusions can vary from small to very large, the presence of an effusion occupying more than two-thirds of a hemithorax is highly suggestive of malignancy (Figure 12-6). Malignant effusions are almost always exudative. Various pleural fluid tests may provide clues to the presence of malignancy (e.g., a high percentage of lymphocytes in the pleural fluid) but the primary means of diagnosis remains cytologic examination of pleural fluid. If  12 7 \\ncytology is negative or indeterminate but malignancy remains a concern, pleural biopsy can be performed. Treatment options and prognosis vary based on the underlying tumor type, but in general, the presence of malignant pleural effusion carries a poor prognosis. Figure 12-6: Massive Pleural Effusion in a Patient with Lymphoma. Note the dense opacity occupying over two-thirds of the left hemithorax that obscures the diaphragm and the left heart border. Due to the mass effect from the effusion, the heart is pushed over towards the right side of the chest. Mesothelioma Referred to as a \"primary\" pleural tumor, mesothelioma is a far less common cause of pleural malignancy than metastatic disease. The primary risk factor is exposure to asbestos and the majority of cases occur in males, as they have historically been more likely to work in asbestos-related trades (e.g., pipe fitters, shipyard workers, brake mechanics, insulators). Cigarette smoking is not thought to increase risk for mesothelioma, although the combination of cigarette smoking and asbestos carries a significant risk of primary lung cancer. Because there is a very long latency (30-40 years) between asbestos exposure and the development of mesothelioma, patients typically present in their 60s-70s, with the most common symptoms being chest pain or dyspnea Chest radiographs usually reveal moderate-large unilateral pleural effusions (typically exudative and hemorrhagic) or unilateral pleural thickening. On CT scan, the presence of a thick rind encasing the entire lung is highly suspicious for this diagnosis (Figure 12-7). The preferred method for diagnosis is surgical biopsy of the pleura, as cytology does not have as high a yield for mesothelioma as in cases of metastatic pleural disease. The staging and treatment of mesothelioma is beyond the scope of this course. Overall survival is poor with a median survival of only 9-17 months from the time of diagnosis. 8  12 \\nFigure 12-7: Mesothelioma on CT Scan of the Chest: In these two images from separate patients, the white arrows point to a thick rind of tissue surrounding the lung parenchyma (black on these CT windows). This pattern is highly suggestive of mesothelioma. The following appendices provide additional optional information about information in this chapter that will not be tested in the examinations for this course. APPENDIX 12-1: DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PROCEDURES INVOLVING THE PLEURAL SPACE Several diagnostic procedures are used to evaluate the disorders involving pleural space and the pleural surfaces of the lung: Thoracentesis: A needle is inserted through the chest wall into the pleural space and pleural fluid is removed using a syringe or vacuum-sealed bottle. This procedure can be performed at the bedside after chest radiography, including lateral decubitus films, or ultrasound has been used to confirm the presence of the effusion. Most commonly, ultrasound or, less commonly, CT-guidance are used to localize the fluid collection and facilitate drainage while minimizing the risk of pneumothorax. A video demonstration of this procedure can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTyH09BcHg A video on the use of ultrasound for thoracentesis can be found here: https://wish.washington.edu/online-learning-modules/#ultrasound Tube Thoracostomy, also known as insertion of a chest tube, involves placement of a plastic tube in the pleural space to drain air or fluid collections. Small-bore tubes are sufficient for air; large bore tubes are preferred for blood or pus. Different approaches are possible but the tube is typically placed via a bedside procedure in which the tube is inserted through an incision between ribs in the lateral chest wall or axilla. Air or fluid may drain passively or suction can be applied to facilitate the process. A video demonstration of this procedure can be found at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMvcm071974 Closed Pleural Biopsy: A large coaxial needle with an interior cutting edge is inserted through the chest wall to remove samples of pleural tissue. An effusion must be present in order to do this procedure safely, in order to avoid puncturing the lung. Because the procedure involves blind sampling of tissue (i.e., the  12 9 \\noperator cannot see what they are sampling), the procedure is used for diagnosis of diseases that cause diffuse changes of the pleural surface (e.g., pleural TB). It is not as useful with diseases that cause focal changes such as malignancy. Pleuroscopy and Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) involve making small incisions in the chest wall and inserting instruments that allow direct visualization of the pleural surface as well as that of the lung. These procedures permit sampling of pleural or lung tissue for diagnostic purposes, but are much less invasive than an open surgical procedure to enter the thorax. Pleurodesis is used in the management of recurrent pleural effusions and pneumothoraces. One of several techniques is used to irritate or inflame the pleural surfaces. The inflamed visceral and parietal pleura then become adherent, thus eliminating the potential space between the layers and preventing the accumulation of fluid and air in that space. Tactics used to irritate the pleural surfaces include instillation of substances such as talc or bleomycin or mechanical irritation during a VATS procedure. The technique is not a first-line treatment option and is not always successful at preventing recurrent disease. APPENDIX 8-2: RESOURCES ON CHEST ULTRASOUND Ultrasound is now widely used in the evaluation of patients with acute respiratory compromise, particularly in the emergency department and intensive care setting. It is a skill you with which you will become more familiar as your training proceeds. Further information about this diagnostic tool including videos showing important findings on lung ultrasound can be found at the sites listed below: http://emergencyultrasoundteaching.com/video_galleries/thoracic_videos/index.h tml https://www.teachingmedicine.com/modules.aspx?mid=1068 10  12 \\n Chapter 13 Pulmonary Vascular Physiology and Pathophysiology INTRODUCTION The pulmonary vascular system plays a critical role in normal respiratory and cardiovascular function and is the focus of several categories of cardiopulmonary diseases. In this chapter, we review the normal physiology of the pulmonary circulation and then examine the primary disorders that affect this system. At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Describe the major demands faced by the pulmonary circulation and how it is designed for optimal gas exchange Describe the determinants of pulmonary blood flow and vascular resistance Describe the anatomy and function of the bronchial circulation Discuss the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical presentation and management of pulmonary hypertension, venous thromboembolism, arteriovenous malformations and hemoptysis Discuss the pathophysiology of pulmonary edema PULMONARY VASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS OF THE PULMONARY CIRCULATION The pulmonary circulation is a unique vascular bed with several noteworthy features that enhance cardiopulmonary function. While credit for describing the modern understanding of the pulmonary circulation is typically given to Sir William Harvey, major contributions to our understanding were actually made several hundred years earlier by the Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis. This history is described in greater detail in an appendix at the end of this chapter. The pulmonary vascular system must meet several important demands. Maintain a Low Pressure System You will recall from Chapter 1 that the alveolar-capillary barrier is exceptionally thin, as the capillary walls are only 1-2 microns in diameter (Figure 13-1). Figure 13-1: Electronic micrograph of pulmonary capillary. The distance between the alveolar space (AS) and the red blood cells (RBC) is only 1-2 microns in thickness. The pressure within the lumen of the alveolar capillary must remain low at all times to protect this thin membrane. in the systemic circulation where capillaries run through organ Unlike parenchyma and muscles and are buttressed by surrounding tissue, in the  13 1 \\nLocation Right atrium Right ventricle Pulmonary artery Left atrium Left ventricle 5 25/5 20/10 10 120/10 pulmonary circulation, capillaries are surrounded by alveolar air spaces, which provide no mechanical support. As a result, pulmonary capillaries cannot withstand the pressures encountered in the systemic circulation and can rupture and leak blood into the alveolar space when pressure rises too high. The normal pressures in the pulmonary circulation and heart are presented in Table 13-1. Table 13-1. Normal Pressures in the Pulmonary Circulation Normal Pressures (mm Hg) Accept the Entire Cardiac Output Maintaining low pulmonary artery pressure is challenging because, unless an individual has an intracardiac right-to-left shunt, the entire cardiac output must pass through the lungs. Pulmonary Artery Pressure (PAP) in the system is related to cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR): PAP = CO x PVR For pressure to remain low as cardiac output rises, as is the case during exercise, pulmonary vascular resistance must decrease. The mechanisms by which this happens are described below. Facilitate Gas Exchange You will also recall from Chapter 1 that the total alveolar surface area is nearly equal to that of a tennis court. To facilitate efficient gas exchange, the pulmonary artery, whose cross-sectional area at the right ventricular outflow tract is roughly 5 cm2, branches repeatedly in a primarily dichotomous manner as it transitions to lobar and segmental arteries, arterioles and eventually to alveolar capillaries. These capillaries ultimately cover 85-95% of that surface area of the alveoli, forming a nearly continuous sheet of blood in the alveolar walls. Beyond these critical tasks, the pulmonary vascular system has other important functions. The capillary network filters blood, thereby preventing small thrombi or pieces of infected material from getting into the systemic circulation where they can cause problems such as stroke or brain abscess, while the vast endothelial surface has metabolic activity including converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, inactivating bradykinin as well as a role in arachidonic acid pathways. MECHANISMS AFFECTING PULMONARY VASCULAR RESISTANCE There are several mechanisms that affect pulmonary vascular resistance. Recruitment and Distention To maintain low pulmonary artery pressures as cardiac output increases, total pulmonary vascular resistance must decrease. Most of this occurs through passive processes known as \"recruitment and distension.\" Under normal resting 2  13 \\nconditions, not all of the pathways within the pulmonary vascular tree are open. However, with the increased blood flow, intravascular pressures increase and these initially closed vessels open (recruitment), providing more pathways for blood flow and decreasing resistance (Figure 13-2). Figure 13-2: Recruitment and Distention of the Pulmonary Vasculature. With increasing pulmonary blood flow, previously closed vessels open, while underutilized vessels accept more flow. increase The pulmonary vessels are relatively compliant such that slight increases in intravascular pressure, the caliber of previously open vessels (distention). Because resistance is inversely related to the fourth power of the radius, these increases in the vessel caliber markedly decrease resistance. Mediators of Vascular Tone The vascular tone of the pulmonary arterial tree is determined by the balance of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. One of the most important mediators is nitric oxide (NO), a small molecule that can signal intravascularly to modulate vascular tone and blood flow. In combination with guanylate cyclase, NO catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP, which results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (Figure 13-3). Figure 13-3: Pulmonary Vascular Smooth Muscle Relaxation. This can be triggered by shear stress, NO donors or acetylcholine. The net result is formation of NO or diffusion of NO to the smooth muscles of the pulmonary arterioles.  13 3 \\nIncreased cGMP leads to myosin light chain dephosphorylation, decoupling and smooth muscle relaxation. NO can be delivered to the muscular arterioles via either inhalation from the nasal sinuses into the alveolar spaces where it diffuses across the alveolar capillary barrier to affect the smooth muscle or via endogenous production within the pulmonary circulation in response to factors such as shear stress. Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction Another important active regulator of pulmonary vascular tone is hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), a vital mechanism for altering local pulmonary vascular resistance and redistributing blood flow to better ventilated areas of the lung. This helps maintain adequate oxygenation (Figure 13-4). Figure 13-4: Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction. Left panel: the situation without HPV.Right panel: HPV decreases blood flow to the poorly ventilated alveolus leading to a higher PO2 after mixing occurs in the left atrium. You will recall the effect of low VA/Q areas on gas exchange from Chapter 6 (left panel in Figure 13-4). With HPV, vasoconstriction occurs in regions with low PAO2. This increases local vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood flow to the poorly oxygenated alveoli and diverting flow to better-ventilated and oxygenated alveoli. In other words, HPV improves ventilation-perfusion matching, a key to good gas exchange. While the blood leaving the poorly oxygenated alveoli still has a low PO2, the volume of blood coming out of these regions is small and contributes less to the overall mixture of blood in the left atrium. The mechanism for sensing regional hypoxia and triggering HPV remains unclear. Certain classes of medications, including calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, diltiazem), NO and phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) can block HPV.If given to a patient with pneumonia, ARDS or atelectasis, they can block HPV, worsen ventilation-perfusion matching and, as a result, worsen oxygenation. Alveolar Pressure The thin-walled capillaries of the pulmonary circulation are exposed to vascular and alveolar pressures. The relatively magnitudes of pressure in these two compartments influence the resistance within the alveolar capillaries and, therefore, blood flow through them. The relationship between the hydrostatic pressure within the alveolar capillaries and the alveolar pressure surrounding 4  13 nitroprusside) sodium donors (nitroglycerin, \\nthem has been likened to a Starling resistor, a collapsible conduit whose cross- sectional area is dependent on transmural pressure (Pin - Pout; Figure 13-5). Figure 13-5: The Starling Resistor Concept. Because the pulmonary capillary runs through the alveolus, its diameter is subject to the effect of alveolar pressure. The cross sectional area of the capillary is determined by the transmural pressure, which, in this case is Phydrostatic-Palveolar. . Within the alveolar capillary bed, three pressures interact to form the Starling resistor and determine blood flow through the capillary (Figure 13-6): the upstream pulmonary arterial pressure (Pa), the downstream pulmonary venous pressure (Pv), and the pressure within the alveolar space surrounding the capillary (PA). Because arterial and venous pressures change as you move from bottom to top of the lung due to gravity and the vertical hydrostatic gradient, there are three potential combinations of pressures that determine resistance and blood flow. Figure 13-6: Zones of Blood Flow in the Lung. Pa: pulmonary arterial pressure; Pv pulmonary venous pressure; PA: Alveolar pressure Zone 1 Conditions (PA > Pa > Pv) The alveolar capillary is completely collapsed and blood flow does not occur. Zone 2 Conditions (Pa > PA > Pv) The driving pressure for blood flow is the difference between the arterial and alveolar pressures. Zone 3 Conditions (Pa > Pv > PA) The vessel does not collapse and the driving pressure is the difference between arterial and venous pressures. Classical teaching has emphasized that there is a vertical distribution of these zones in the lung based on the effects of gravity on arterial and venous 5  13 \\nrecent refined research has pressures (Zonal model of pulmonary blood flow): Zone 1 conditions predominate at the top of the lung where pulmonary arterial and venous pressures are at their lowest due to the effect of gravity, Zone 2 conditions predominate in the mid lung fields as vascular pressures increase and Zone 3 conditions predominate at the base of the lungs where arterial and venous pressures are both greater than alveolar pressure. More this model and demonstrates that at any given vertical level of the lung there is a mixture of Zone 1, 2 and 3 conditions. Lung Volumes and Their Effect on ExtrA-and Intra-alveolar Vessels The pulmonary circulation transitions from larger vessels running through the interstitium (extra-alveolar vessels) to microvessels within alveolar walls (alveolar vessels). The resistance of these vessels changes as a function of lung volume. At low lung volumes, intra-alveolar vessels are at their largest caliber and lowest resistance (Figure 13-7A). At higher volumes, these vessels are stretched like an elastic band and their diameter decreases. These intra-alveolar vessels are also subject to the effects of alveolar pressure, which rises as lung volume increases, decreasing transmural pressure across the capillary walls. Extra-alveolar vessels tend to have a small diameter and higher resistance at lower lung volumes, while at higher lung volumes they are pulled or \"tethered\" open by the expanding lung and have a relatively lower resistance. Because the extra-alveolar and alveolar vessels are in series, the total resistance within the circuit is additive. At low lung volumes, most of the resistance is due to the extra-alveolar vessels while at high lung volumes most of the resistance is due to the intra-alveolar vessels. Minimum total vascular resistance occurs at functional residual capacity (Figure 13-7B), the lung volume at which we spend most of the respiratory cycle, minimizing the work of the right heart. Figure 13-7: Panel A: Changes in size of extrA-and intra-alveolar vessels with changes in lung volume. Panel B: Changes in pulmonary vascular resistance as a function of lung volume. Total vascular resistance (solid line) is the sum of the resistance associated with the extrA-and intra-alveolar vessels at any lung volume. DISTRIBUTION OF PULMONARY BLOOD FLOW On average, pulmonary blood flow is greatest at the bases of the lungs and decreases as you move toward the apices. This pattern has long been attributed to gravity and the vertical hydrostatic pressure gradient in the lungs (i.e., gravity directs blood to the more dependent regions of the lung). More recent research, 6  13 \\nhowever, suggests that overall distribution of flow is more complicated than this simple model and that other factors beyond gravity affect blood flow distribution. At any vertical level of the lung, there is considerable regional variability in blood flow. Despite this heterogeneity of flow, regional perfusion and ventilation are well matched: well-ventilated areas of lung receive high blood flow regardless of their position relative to gravity while poorly ventilated areas receive less blood flow regardless of their vertical position (Chapter 6, Figure 6-5). This pattern of matching perfusion with ventilation contributes to efficient gas exchange. THE BRONCHIAL CIRCULATION In addition to its pulmonary arterial supply, the lung also receives blood from the bronchial circulation, a high-pressure system arising from the aorta and intercostal arteries. The bronchial circulation supplies the trachea, airways, and vasa vasorum of the pulmonary arterial tree and is important for delivering fluid to regulate airway temperature and humidity. The venous drainage from much of the bronchial circulation is via the azygous vein to the right atrium, while that from smaller airways is via pulmonary veins draining to the left atrium. The portion of blood flow returning directly to the left atrium is deoxygenated and therefore decreases the average PO2 in the left side of the heart, contributing to the normal shunt described in Chapter 6. The bronchial circulation has unique contributions to disease processes. Unlike the pulmonary arterial system, the bronchial circulation can neovascularize. This is seen in lung cancers that require a large blood supply to support their nutritional needs and derive their blood flow from the bronchial circulation as well as chronic suppurative processes, such as lung abscesses and cystic fibrosis, where increased blood flow to these areas also comes from the bronchial circulation. Most hemoptysis is from the bronchial circulation and because this blood is under systemic pressure, it can result in life-threatening bleeding (discussed below). DISEASES OF THE PULMONARY VASCULAR SYSTEM PULMONARY HYPERTENSION When the compensatory mechanisms designed to maintain a low-pressure pulmonary circulation go awry or are exhausted, pressure within the pulmonary circulation rises, resulting in a class of diseases known as Pulmonary Hypertension. Defined as a mean pulmonary artery (PA) pressure greater than 25 mm Hg at rest, this problem can be idiopathic or occur due to a variety of problems involving either the lungs, heart or, in some cases, the liver. To understand the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension, it is useful to look at the flow equation as it applies to the pulmonary circulation: PBF = (mean PAP - LAP) where PBF refers to pulmonary blood flow, PAP is pulmonary artery pressure, LAP is left atrial pressure and PVR is pulmonary vascular resistance. From this, we see that PA pressure can rise due to increases in pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary blood flow or left atrial pressure. Normally, recruitment and distention prevent increased PA pressure with increasing pulmonary blood flow. If the effects of recruitment and distention are exhausted, however, pressure rises with increasing flow. Elevated PA pressure has several hemodynamic consequences. Due to the normally low PVR, right ventricular (RV) afterload is low and the RV wall is thin compared to the LV.Increased PA pressure raises RV afterload, leading to hypertrophy and/or dilation of the RV and increased myocardial oxygen consumption. If the strained RV fails to deliver enough blood flow to the left heart, LV preload and cardiac output fall as well. In addition, the RV can become so dilated that the interventricular septum bulges into the LV, further compromising LV filling and stroke volume. When the pressure on the right side equals that on the systemic side, preexisting left-to-right shunts reverse to become right-to-left shunts with associated hypoxemia (Eisenmenger Syndrome). Causes of Pulmonary Hypertension The causes of pulmonary hypertension can be categorized according to the underlying mechanism for elevated PA pressure. Mechanistically, a critical distinction between Group 1 and Group 2 is that whereas in Group 1, pulmonary vascular resistance is high due to characteristic histopathologic changes that narrow pulmonary arterioles, in Group 2, pulmonary vascular resistance is low-normal because high left sided heart pressures lead to recruitment and distention of the pulmonary vasculature. High pulmonary artery pressure in these cases is due to the increased hydrostatic pressure. Note that left-to-right shunts due to ventricular septal defects or patent ductus arteriosus, are placed in Group 1 because the increased pulmonary blood flow causes higher shear stress on endothelial cells which triggers cellular proliferation in the vessel wall, narrowing vessel diameter over time. Clinical Presentation The presentation varies based on the degree of pulmonary hypertension and the underlying cause. Patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension classically present with dyspnea on exertion, fatigue and weakness due to poor cardiac output and increased right heart strain during exercise. In severe cases, patients may develop exertional chest pain or syncope. Other pulmonary or systemic symptoms such as cough and fever are typically absent. Patients with pulmonary hypertension due to underlying disease (e.g., COPD) have variable presentations. In many cases, patients present with symptoms of their underlying disease and the pulmonary hypertension is only detected as part of the work-up for that disorder while in other cases, the onset of pulmonary hypertension causes a change from their baseline symptoms. Physical exam findings may be absent in early disease, but as the disorder progresses, patients may demonstrate elevated neck veins with prominent a, c and v-waves, a right ventricular heave, a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound and a murmur of tricuspid regurgitation. In very severe disease when the right ventricle begins to fail, patients develop hepatomegaly, ascites and lower extremity edema. This is termed cor pulmonale. Several tests done to evaluate chronic dyspnea are suggestive of the diagnosis: Chest Imaging Plain chest radiographs may show enlarged pulmonary arteries, decreased peripheral vascular markings (oligemia), and right heart enlargement. Chest CT scans with intravenous contrast may also show enlarged pulmonary arteries, a large right atrium and a dilated right ventricle (Figure 13-8). Electrocardiography This may demonstrate right axis deviation, tall P-waves in lead II (P-pulmonale, due to right atrial enlargement), and large R waves in V1 (RV hypertrophy). Pulmonary Function Testing This may show an isolated decrease in the DLCO (normal spirometry and lung volumes). If history and physical exam or preliminary testing raise suspicion for pulmonary hypertension, the diagnosis is confirmed by one of two tests:  13 9 \\nFigure 13-8: Pulmonary Hypertension on Chest Imaging. In the plain radiograph on the left, the pulmonary arteries (white arrows) are enlarged compared to the film on the right. The right side of the heart is also more prominent than normal. In the CT images, the pulmonary arteries (PA) in the image on the left are enlarged compared to the normal image on the right Echocardiography The PA pressure is estimated by identifying a jet of regurgitant blood flow across the tricuspid valve. The peak velocity of this jet is measured and then converted to an estimate of PA pressure. This is the most appropriate initial test to perform when you suspect the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary artery catheterization (Swan-Ganz catheter) This is the most accurate way to measure PA pressure but is typically not done as the first step due to the invasive nature of the test. When elevated PA pressures are confirmed, patients undergo a thorough work- up to identify the underlying cause and guide further management (Table 13-3). Table 13-3. Tests Used in the Evaluation of Pulmonary Hypertension Test Role in Evaluation Arterial blood gas High resolution chest CT Laboratory studies Rule out chronic hypoventilation Evaluate for parenchymal lung disease Rule out cirrhosis, collagen vascular disease, HIV Overnight polysomnogram Rule out sleep-disordered breathing Pulmonary function testing Evaluate for obstructive or restrictive lung Ventilation-perfusion scan or CT Pulmonary Angiogram disease if not done earlier in evaluation Evaluate for chronic thromboembolic disease If the results of this extensive work-up are negative, the patient is deemed to have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and is placed in Group 1. Management of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Management varies based on whether the patient has a treatable underlying condition as the cause of pulmonary hypertension: 10  13 \\nIdiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treatment involves the use of medications that cause pulmonary vasodilation and is delivered in oral form or continuous intravenous form depending on the severity of their illness or response to previous treatments. The specific medication classes including mechanisms of action and side effects/toxicities are discussed below. The method for selecting the appropriate class of medications and route of administration is beyond the scope of this course. Prostacyclin Receptor Agonists: These are synthetic compounds that mimic the actions of the endogenous prostacyclins/prostaglandins produced by the cyclooxygenase enzymatic pathway in vascular endothelial cells, platelets, and various other cells. When released locally, prostacyclins act as potent vasodilators and inhibitors of platelet aggregation. Epoprostenol is a synthetic form of prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2). Other synthetic prostacyclin receptor agonists include Treprostinil and Iloprost. Each of these drugs stimulates prostacyclin G protein-coupled receptors (termed prostaglandin/prostacyclin I2 receptor or IP-R) expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells in the pulmonary vasculature, as well as circulating platelets in close proximity. Following activation, prostacyclin receptors stimulate the Gas signaling pathway detailed in Figure 13-9, ultimately dephosphorylating myosin light chain kinase and preventing actin-myosin cross-linking. Through this mechanism, prostacyclins produce a pronounced and rapid vasodilation (as well as inhibition of platelet aggregation). Common side effects include flushing, muscle pain, nausea/vomiting, dermal ulcer, headache and dizziness. Figure 13-9: Mechanism of Action of Prostacyclin Receptor Agonists Endothelin Receptor Antagonists: Endothelin-1 is a 21-amino acid peptide produced in and released by pulmonary vascular endothelial cells. In a paracrine manner, endothelin-1 stimulates the Type A endothelin G protein-coupled receptor (ETA) expressed in the plasma membrane of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells. Activated ETA receptors couple to the Gaq/11 signaling pathway and increase intracellular Ca2+, resulting in significant vasoconstriction and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (Figure 13-10). Numerous forms of PAH are associated with excessive endothelin signaling in the pulmonary vasculature, due to enhanced endothelin release and/or aberrant endothelin A receptor signaling.  13 11 \\n Figure 13-10: Mechanism of Action of Endothelin Receptor Antagonists Endothelin receptor antagonists are synthetic, small molecules typically administered orally. Ambrisentan, Bosentan and Macitentan are the primary members of this class of drugs. Each binds with high affinity to the ETA receptor, and competitively displaces endothelin-1 from the orthosteric binding site, thereby blocking endothelin-1 stimulated vasoconstriction and lowering pulmonary artery pressure. The primary difference between the endothelin receptor antagonists involve their relative selectivities between the ETA and closely related ETB subtype: Bosentan and Macitentan are non-selective ETA/ETB antagonists, whereas Ambrisentan is highly selective for the ETA receptor subtype. Commonly observed side effects of endothelin receptor antagonists include peripheral edema, hepatotoxicity and headache. Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE5) Inhibitors Small molecule inhibitors of the Type 5 phosphodiesterases (PDE5) include Sildenafil, Tadalafil and Vardenafil. Although more commonly used to treat erectile dysfunction, PDE5 inhibitors are efficacious for PAH, particularly when used in combination with prostacyclins or endothelin receptor antagonists. PDE5 inhibitors block the actions of PDE5, which constitutively degrades cGMP in vascular smooth muscle cells. Recall that endothelium-derived nitric oxide stimulates guanylyl cyclase in adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, which then produces cGMP, resulting in dephosphorylation of myosin light chains and vasodilation. By preventing cGMP degradation, PDE5 inhibitors enhance the guanylyl cyclase-cGMP pathway and vasodilate pulmonary blood vessels, resulting in decreased pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. PDE5 inhibitors are administered orally. Common side effects include headache, flushing, GI upset, and muscle/joint pain. Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs) Both cardiac and vascular selective CCBs, including diltiazem, amlodipine and nifedipine are used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Side effects include excessive hypotension and bradycardia. These drugs have already been discussed in the cardiology portion of the CPR block, and will be discussed again in the renal section. Please refer to your Excel drug lists and Cardiology pharmacology sessions for specific details about these medications. 12  13 \\nPulmonary Arterial Hypertension with an Identified Underlying Cause Management involves treating the underlying disease process when possible. For example, patients with mitral valve disease may require surgical repair of the damaged valve. Supplemental oxygen is used in patients with alveolar hypoventilation and severe COPD or IPF.Vasodilators are added to treatment of the underlying disease for patients with collagen vascular diseases or HIV.An algorithm summarizing the evaluation and management of pulmonary hypertension is provided in Figure 13-11. Figure 13-11: Algorithm for Evaluation and Management of Pulmonary Hypertension. PA: pulmonary artery; PASP: pulmonary artery systolic pressure; PVR: pulmonary vascular resistance VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM Blood clots can form in the deep veins of the extremities (deep venous thrombosis, DVT) and travel to the lungs and lodge in the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary embolism, PE). These diseases are collectively referred to as venous thromboembolism (VTE). In other clinical situations, fat, air, amniotic fluid and tumor can embolize to the lung. Why Does Thromboembolism Occur? The risk for VTE increases when at least one of three conditions is present: venous stasis, hypercoagulability and vascular injury (Virchow\\'s Triad). Examples of risk factors within each of these categories are listed in Table 13-4.  13 13 \\nProlonged immobility Spinal cord injury Long plane rides Pregnancy (IVC compression) Recovery from surgery Vascular Injury Major surgery Hip or knee surgery Major trauma Pelvic or lower extremity long bone fractures Hereditary thrombophilia Malignancy Nephrotic syndrome Pregnancy Estrogen therapy Table 13-4. Examples of Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism Hypercoagulability Stasis Pathophysiology 90% of clinically apparent pulmonary emboli arise within the deep veins of the lower extremities, while the remainder develops in the upper extremities or the iliac, proximal femoral and pelvic veins. Calf vein thromboses rarely embolize but can extend to more proximal vessels and subsequently embolize to the lungs. Once thrombus has formed in a given location, the risk of embolization is highest in the acute period before fibrinolysis and thrombus organization occur. Pulmonary embolism has several effects on gas exchange and hemodynamics: Abnormal Gas Exchange Although they cause dead space (i.e., ventilation without perfusion), which is not one of the five causes of hypoxemia, pulmonary emboli cause hypoxemia by diverting blood to other areas of the lung leading to changes in VA/Q ratios in those areas (more low VA/Q). In addition, large pulmonary emboli increase PA pressure and impair right ventricular function and, subsequently, cardiac output. As a result, mixed venous oxygen content falls, which worsens arterial oxygenation in the setting of low VA/Q ratios. Occasionally, the elevated right atrial pressure opens a foramen ovale and causes right-to-left shunt. Hemodynamic changes The impact on cardiac function varies based on the cross-sectional area of the pulmonary vasculature occluded by thrombus and the patient\\'s underlying cardiopulmonary status. In people with normal cardiopulmonary function and a small clot burden, recruitment and distention prevent a rise in PVR such that PA pressure and right heart function are unaffected. With increasing loss of cross- sectional area or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, the limits of recruitment and distention are reached more quickly and PA pressure rises, occasionally to the point that the right heart dilates and wall tension increases, leading to RV ischemia and impaired cardiac output. Clinical Presentation Upper or lower extremity DVT commonly presents with swelling, pain, erythema and warmth of the affected extremity. Notably, these findings are often asymmetric (i.e., present in only one extremity). Importantly, DVT can be present even in the absence of these findings. PE most commonly presents with the acute onset of dyspnea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Cough, hemoptysis, leg pain, or leg swelling may also be present. The most common sign is tachypnea although patients may also demonstrate tachycardia and a loud pulmonic component of the second heart sound. A 14  13 \\nchallenging feature of PE is that the clinical presentation varies significantly between individuals. In fact, some people are asymptomatic and are found to have PE as an incidental finding during the work-up of another issue. Evaluation Several different studies are used to diagnose deep venous thrombosis: Contrast venography Intravenous contrast is administered under fluoroscopy to identify \"filling defects\" within the deep leg veins. It is the diagnostic gold standard but is rarely used. Duplex ultrasonography Compression ultrasound of the extremities is combined with Doppler signaling to detect thrombus in a vein. This is the most commonly used test. Studies used to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism include: Computed tomography (spiral CT Angiogram) Intravenous contrast is injected and CT images are taken immediately, as the contrast leaves the right heart, to identify areas of filling defects within the pulmonary arteries. This has become the most widely used diagnostic test and offers the benefit of being able to visualize the lung parenchyma and detect other problems. An example of a positive study is provided in Figure 13-12. Figure 13-12: Pulmonary embolism on CT angiography. The arrows in each image point to filling defects within the pulmonary arterial system, consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Ventilation-perfusion Scan In this study, the patient inhales nebulized radiolabeled xenon or technetium. Any area of lung that receives ventilation \"lights up\" on special imaging. Radiolabeled albumin is then injected intravenously and a second set of images obtained to identify areas of the lung that receive perfusion. The ventilation and perfusion images are compared to identify areas that receive ventilation but not perfusion. Such mismatches are indicative of pulmonary embolism.  13 15 \\nPulmonary angiography Under fluoroscopic imaging, a pulmonary artery catheter is inserted and intravenous contrast is administered to identify filling defects within the vessels. It is the diagnostic gold standard but use is limited by its higher risk. A full discussion of how these tests are used in the diagnosis of VTE is beyond the scope of this course. One diagnostic principle warrants attention, however. With any of the tests noted above, the results must be interpreted in light of the clinical suspicion for VTE.If the clinician\\'s assessment based on the history and exam, referred to as the pre-test probability, suggests there is a high likelihood of VTE, a single negative test does not rule-out the diagnosis and further testing is required. Similarly, if the pre-test probability for the disease is low, a positive study does not rule in the diagnosis. Additional testing is warranted here as well. Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism Patients diagnosed with VTE are promptly started on anticoagulation with heparin. Failure to start anticoagulation and delay in achieving therapeutic levels are leading risk factors for recurrent VTE.Patients are also started on the Vitamin K antagonist, warfarin, or a direct oral anticoagulant (Direct thrombin inhibitor or Factor Xa inhibitor), which they will remain on for 3-6 months or longer depending on their risk factor profile and whether this is their first event or a recurrence. Patients with a contraindication to anticoagulation (e.g., intracranial bleeding) may have a filter placed in their inferior vena cava designed to \"catch\" or break up any remaining or new thrombi that dislodge from the lower extremity veins. Thrombolytics (e.g., tissue plasminogen activator) are reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability and/or cardiac arrest, but are occasionally considered in cases of normotensive patients with severe right heart dysfunction. PULMONARY EDEMA While pulmonary edema, a fluid build-up in the alveolar and interstitial spaces, is a common complication of cardiac disease discussed earlier in this block, the topic is considered again here because the pathophysiology is intimately related to problems with the pulmonary vasculature. Pathophysiology As in other organ systems, the fluid balance between the vascular space and the lung interstitium is governed by the Starling relationship: Net Fluid Movement = [Lp x S] x [Dhydrostatic pressure - Doncotic pressure] where Lp refers to capillary permeability and S represents the capillary surface area. With imbalances between oncotic or hydrostatic pressure or an increase in capillary permeability, fluid accumulates in the interstitium and alveolar spaces, causing pulmonary edema. This has several consequences. Fluid accumulation in the alveoli impairs alveolar expansion and causes shunt while interstitial fluid buildup around the small airways - known as \"bronchial cuffing\" - may cause airway narrowing and airflow obstruction, leading to VA/Q inequality. Lung compliance is also decreased leading to an increase in the work of breathing. Causes of Pulmonary Edema There are two broad categories of causes of pulmonary edema: 16  13 \\n Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema This is the most common type of pulmonary edema. Elevated left heart pressure impedes outflow from the pulmonary circulation leading to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure. Elevated left atrial or pulmonary venous pressure, can arise via one of several mechanisms, including: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (e.g., acute MI, cardiomyopathy). Elevated left atrial pressures in the absence of ventricular dysfunction (e.g., severe mitral stenosis). Diastolic dysfunction (impaired LV relaxation) Severe increases in afterload leading to acute left ventricular dysfunction Non-cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema Edema can also develop despite normal left heart function and pressure. High Altitude Pulmonary Edema: A marked rise in pulmonary artery pressure at high altitude causes fluid to leak into the interstitium. Re-expansion Pulmonary Edema: Overly rapid re-expansion of a collapsed lung during drainage of a pneumothorax or pleural effusion may lead to primarily ipsilateral edema formation. Neurogenic Pulmonary Edema: Following severe central nervous system injury, (e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage), large rises in sympathetic nervous system output increase hydrostatic pressure and vascular permeability. Negative Pressure Pulmonary Edema: Pulmonary edema can develop following resolution of acute upper airway obstruction, due to large negative intrathoracic pressures generated while the airway was obstructed. Clinical Presentation The presentation varies based on the underlying cause and the rate of onset, with more rapid onset associated with greater degrees of respiratory distress. Patients primarily complain of dyspnea but may also have cough, chest pain, or chest tightness. The most common sign is crackles on lung auscultation. Elevated neck veins and peripheral edema are often seen with cardiogenic edema but are typically lacking in non-cardiogenic forms. Bronchial cuffing can cause wheezing in some individuals (referred to as \"cardiac asthma\"). Evaluation Aside from Brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, which are elevated in heart failure, there are no other useful blood tests for determining the etiology of pulmonary edema. Chest radiographs demonstrate bilateral alveolar opacities. In cardiogenic edema, additional findings include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, peri-hilar distribution of the opacities and cephalization (redistribution of blood flow to the upper zones of the lung) (Figure 13-13). Patients may also have small horizontally oriented linear markings in the lateral lung fields, known as Kerley B- lines, which fluid accumulation. These additional findings are usually lacking in non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. interstitial and lymphatic indicate  13 17 \\nFigure 13-13: Radiographs from the same patient at different times. Panel A: the heart is enlarged due to his cardiomyopathy and the lung fields are clear. Panel B: The heart is larger due to volume overload and there are bilateral, perihilar opacities. Management Management varies based on the underlying cause. Diuretics are the mainstay of treatment for acute cardiogenic edema as they decrease intravascular volume and reduce capillary hydrostatic pressure. By causing venodilation, nitrates and opiates help decrease venous return and left-ventricular preload. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a tight-fitting mask improves oxygenation and cardiac function by stenting open alveoli and increasing intrathoracic pressure around the left ventricle, which reduces both preload and afterload. In non-cardiogenic edema, diuretics are generally not used because many of these syndromes are associated with intravascular volume depletion due to the extensive capillary leak. Instead, treatment is largely supportive (oxygen, CPAP, invasive mechanical ventilation) while the problem resolves on its own within 24- 48 hours. High-altitude pulmonary edema is treated with descent to lower elevation, oxygen and/or treatment with a pulmonary vasodilator. ANATOMIC SHUNTS The term \"shunt\" refers to blood which passes from the systemic venous system to the systemic arterial system without passing through the gas exchanging areas of the lung. All individuals have a small right-to-left shunt, which accounts for the normal alveolar-arterial difference. In certain diseases, however, abnormal communications develop between the pulmonary and systemic circulations, (anatomic right-to-left shunts) and cause hypoxemia. There are two categories of right-to-left shunts. Intracardiac shunts include disorders, such as Tetralogy of Fallot and Eisenmenger syndrome in which right- to-left communication occurs within the heart. In intrapulmonary shunts, the right- to-left communication occurs through arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) - abnormal vascular structures in which blood passes from a pulmonary artery to a pulmonary vein without traversing a pulmonary capillary bed. 18  13 \\nPathophysiology Right-to-left shunts have several consequences: Gas exchange Because blood bypasses the pulmonary capillaries, deoxygenated blood returns to the systemic circulation causing hypoxemia. The PaO2 and SaO2 vary inversely with the size of the shunt. With anatomic shunts in the lung bases, changing from the supine to the erect posture can redistribute blood flow and lead to an increase in the shunt fraction and further hypoxemia, referred to as \"orthodeoxia.\" Pulmonary hemodynamics Because shunted blood does not flow through a capillary network, pulmonary vascular resistance in the area of the shunt is reduced. Whether overall PVR is reduced varies based on the size of the shunt. Paradoxical emboli If blood bypasses the capillary network (Figure 13-14), particles that would otherwise be filtered out of the circulation can enter the systemic circulation, where they travel to the brain and other organs, causing end-organ ischemia (e.g., stroke, mesenteric ischemia) or infection (e.g., brain abscess). Figure 13-14: Bypassing the Filter Function of the Pulmonary Capillary Network with Arteriovenous Malformations. Clinical Presentation While dyspnea is the most common complaint, many patients lack symptoms. Patients with intrapulmonary shunts and orthodeoxia often note that their dyspnea is worse in the upright position (\"platypnea\"). The most common sign is hypoxemia, often at rest and particularly with exercise as the oxygen content of the mixed venous blood traveling through the shunt decreases. Some patients have digital clubbing. When the AVMs are part of a systemic syndrome, patients may have features of that disorder, such as cutaneous telangiectasias or gastrointestinal bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Some patients present at an early age with stroke or cerebral abscess. Evaluation  13 19 \\nLarge AVMs may be visible on chest radiograph or chest CT scan (Figure 13-15) while microvascular AVMS are generally not seen on these studies. If the diagnosis of AVM or right-to-left shunt is suspected, one of several studies is done to support or make the diagnosis: Figure 13-15: Arteriovenous Malformation on Chest CT.The AVMs are the thick white structures circled by the dashed line. Notice how dilated these vessels are compared to the other blood vessels in the lung fields. 100% oxygen breathing The PaO2 is measured while the patient breaths an FIO2 of 1.0. With the normal (<5%) right-to-left shunt this should be ~ 570 mm Hg. The size of the shunt can be estimated by comparing the measured and expected PaO2. Perfusion scan Radiolabeled macroaggregated albumin is administered intravenously. Normally, this is too large to pass through the pulmonary capillaries. With AVMs, however, the particle gets into the systemic circulation and travels to the brain and kidneys (Figure 13-16). Radiotracer uptake in these organs is measured and used to calculate a shunt fraction Figure 13-16: Perfusion Scan: In the normal scan in the left panel, tracer uptake is only seen in the lungs (L). In the abnormal scan on the right, tracer uptake can be seen in the brain (B) and kidneys (K) as demonstrated by their grayer appearance compared to the image in the left panel. 20  13 \\nContrast echocardiography Saline is agitated to create micro-bubbles and rapidly injected through an IV catheter while echocardiography is performed. In the absence of shunt, bubbles appear in the right heart but never appear in the left heart because they are trapped by the pulmonary capillaries. In intracardiac shunt, the bubbles bypass the capillary filter and appear in the left heart within 1-2 cardiac cycles whereas in intrapulmonary shunt, bubbles appear on the left side of the heart after 4-5 beats. Management Patients with disorders that predispose to right-to-left shunts, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, should be screened for AVMs Patients with large AVMs are at increased risk for paradoxical emboli and should be referred to interventional radiology for catheter-directed embolization of the vessels feeding the AVM.Similar treatment is warranted in patients with AVM complications such as intracerebral abscess. HEMOPTYSIS In a variety of diseases, the pulmonary or bronchial circulations are disrupted and bleeding occurs into the alveoli and/or airways, leading the patient to cough up blood (hemoptysis). In some cases, the amount of bleeding is small and of no hemodynamic consequence while in other cases, massive bleeding occurs and can lead to hypotension, asphyxiation and, perhaps, death. Causes of Hemoptysis The causes of hemoptysis are best understood by breaking them down according to the source of the bleeding. Bronchial Circulation Sources of Hemoptysis Despite receiving far less blood flow than the pulmonary arterial system, the bronchial circulation is the more common source of hemoptysis. This occurs because the bronchial circulation is perfused under systemic pressure and supplies blood to the airways, a common site for lesions and diseases associated with bleeding. The main causes of this form of hemoptysis include suppurative airway and parenchymal lung diseases, including bronchiectasis (e.g., cystic fibrosis), tuberculosis, lung abscess and bronchitis, and neoplasms that either arise from, grow into or metastasize to the airway. Pulmonary Circulation Sources of Hemoptysis Important examples of this less common source of hemoptysis include: Autoimmune disorders: Inflammatory conditions causing vasculitis within the pulmonary circulation cause diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. This can be seen, for example, in Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis or Goodpasture\\'s Syndrome. These patients usually have hemoptysis, but it may be absent in some cases. Vascular diseases: including pulmonary embolism (particularly if there is infarction of ischemic lung tissue), pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and pulmonary artery aneurysms.  13 21 \\nDisorders with elevated pulmonary capillary pressures: (e.g., advanced mitral stenosis). Infections: In rare cases, tuberculosis causes bleeding from a pulmonary artery source. In cavitary lung disease, pulmonary arterial vessels in the wall of the cavity may dilate and rupture, a phenomenon known as Rasmussen\\'s aneurysm. In up to 30% of cases of hemoptysis, an underlying cause of the bleeding is not identified. This is known as \"cryptogenic hemoptysis.\" Bleeding typically resolves in such cases within 6 months and recurrence is uncommon. Clinical Presentation The clinical presentation varies based on the source and the volume of expectorated blood. Some patients cough up as much as 200 to 600 mL of blood within a 24-hour period and are deemed to have \"massive hemoptysis,\" while others cough up smaller amounts (e.g., the sputum is \"tinged\" with blood or contains quarter-sized amounts of frank blood) and are labeled as having \"non- massive hemoptysis.\" Despite the lower volumes involved, the majority of these patients still require evaluation for this problem. Note that the specific volume of blood that constitutes \"massive hemoptysis\" is not well-defined in the medical literature and will vary from resource to resource. In some diseases (e.g., carcinoid tumors), hemoptysis may be on the only presenting symptom while in cases where the hemoptysis is secondary to a systemic syndrome, the patients present with symptoms of that disorder. Evaluation and Management After confirming that the blood is coming from the lower airways and does not represent epistaxis (nose bleed) or aspirated blood from gastrointestinal bleeding, the work-up and management vary based on the clinical scenario. The general approach is summarized in Figure 13-17. Figure 13-17: Algorithm for Evaluation and Management of Hemoptysis. 22  13 \\nMassive Hemoptysis The initial priority is to localize the source of the bleeding using a combination of imaging and airway inspection by bronchoscopy. Upon identifying the source of the bleeding, the patient is referred for embolization of the vessels feeding the bleeding area. In cases where embolization is not successful, the patient may require surgical resection of the bleeding portion of the lung. Rather than exsanguination, asphyxiation due to blood accumulating in the airways and alveoli is the primary cause of death in patients with massive hemoptysis. Non-Massive Hemoptysis Diagnostic evaluation may be deferred in patients under age 40 who are non- smokers, have a normal chest radiograph and whose hemoptysis has been going on for less than 2 weeks. An example would be a patient with blood-tinged sputum after a recent viral upper respiratory tract infection. Patients who do not meet those criteria, or who have other features suggestive of malignancy, pulmonary-renal syndrome or other diagnosis should undergo bronchoscopy to inspect the airways and identify a source of bleeding. A CT scan of the chest may also be considered, particularly if there are any abnormalities on the chest radiograph. Appropriate management depends on the cause of the bleeding. Appendix: Contributions of Ibn al-Nafis to the Current Understanding of the Pulmonary Circulation Credit for the delineating the modern understanding of the pulmonary circulation has long been given to Sir William Harvey and other 16th century renaissance scholars. However, it has become apparent that it was the work of the Arab physician Ibn al-Nafis during the Islamic Golden Age that first called into question the early teachings about the pulmonary circulation and contributed greatly to what we know about this unique vascular bed today. Some of the earliest theories regarding the pulmonary circulation were put forth by Galen in the second century and held sway for over a thousand years. Galen argued that food was transported from the gut to the liver where blood was formed. The blood then moved from the liver to the right ventricle where some of it entered the lungs through the pulmonary artery and the remainder traveled across the interventricular septum through a series of invisible pores. That blood then mixed with inhaled air, infusing it with a \"vital spirit\" that was then moved via the arterial blood to the rest of the body. Several hundred years before Harvey and other renaissance scholars such as Michael Servetus, did their work on the pulmonary circulation, Ibn al-Nafis called Galen\\'s model into question. Al-Nafis was born in Damascus in 1213 and completed medical training at the Medical College Hospital before moving at the age of 23 to Cairo where he eventually became the physician-in-chief at the Al- Mansouri Hospital. Just six years later, when he was only 29 years of age, he published Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna\\'s Canon in which, among other things, he revised the understanding of the pulmonary circulation in several important respects. One of the major problems with Galen\\'s theory was that anatomists were unable to identify pores within the interventricular septum. In Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna\\'s Canon, al-Nafis denied the existence of such pores, stating \"... but there is no passage between these two cavities [right  13 23 \\nand left ventricles]; for the substance of the heart is solid in this region and has neither a visible passage... nor an invisible one which could have permitted the transmission of the blood.\" In addition to denying the existence of the pores, al- Nafis postulated that blood could only travel from the right ventricle to the left ventricle through the pulmonary circulation and that there were very small communications between the pulmonary arteries and the pulmonary veins. The latter was an allusion to the existence of pulmonary capillaries, which would not be formally seen and described for another 400 years. Al-Nafis\\' work was largely unknown in the west until the last century when an Egyptian physician named Muhyo Al Deen el Tatawi discovered it while doing research for a doctoral thesis in Berlin Germany. His thesis was never published but came to the attention of a medical orientalist named Max Meyerhoff who wrote a commentary about it before eventually publishing translations of portions of al-Nafis\\' Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna\\'s Canon. Further information on this topic can be found in the following resources: West JB.Ibn al-Nafis, The Pulmonary Circulation and the Islamic Golden Age. J Appl Physiol 2008. 105(6): 1877-1880.

In many disease states such as COPD, heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, one or more of these systems are impaired, leading to severe exercise limitation. This chapter describes the physiologic responses to exercise in healthy individuals and abnormal responses seen in selected disease states. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: integration of multiple systems Describe the physiology of exercise in healthy individuals including the including changes in hemodynamic, ventilatory and gas exchange parameters Explain the relationship between maximum oxygen uptake and cardiac output and list the factors that determine maximum oxygen uptake Describe the physiology of exercise limitation in individuals with underlying cardiac or pulmonary diseases Describe the role of cardiopulmonary exercise testing in the evaluation of patients with chronic dyspnea Interpret clinical information and basic data from a cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine the primary system limiting exercise HOW WE EVALUATE EXERCISE PERFORMANCE: THE CARDIO- PULMONARY EXERCISE TEST Although we often assess our patient\\'s exercise capacity through careful history taking, we formally evaluate exercise performance using a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). In this test, subjects exercise on either a treadmill or bicycle. Both the speed and grade of the treadmill, or the resistance on the bicycle wheel are steadily increased until the subject can no longer continue due to exhaustion, pain or symptoms such as leg fatigue or dyspnea. This is referred to as exercising to a \"symptom-limited maximum.\" During the test, heart rate, oxygen saturation and the electrocardiogram (ECG) are monitored continuously and blood pressure is measured intermittently. The individual wears a tight fitting mask to allow collection of all exhaled gases to measure minute ventilation, oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide production. In some cases, blood gases are also measured to assess the adequacy of gas exchange and measure dead space. The test is far more comprehensive than the standard exercise treadmill test and provides information that can be used to identify the major system(s) responsible for limiting a patient\\'s exercise capacity. In addition to identifying the system limiting exercise capacity, the CPET can be used to determine a patient\\'s fitness to undergo a lung resection, follow disease progression, make treatment decisions (e.g., when to list a heart failure patient for transplant) and monitor the effects of training in highly conditioned athletes.  14 1 \\nMAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE The simplest quantitative marker of a person\\'s capacity to perform sustained vigorous exercise is the maximal oxygen uptake. Oxygen uptake (VO2) refers to minute. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) is the amount of oxygen being used at how much oxygen the person is taking up and delivering to the tissues per VO!=Q\\t(C\"O!-C#$O!) peak exercise (i.e., at the point that the person cannot do any more and stops exercising). To understand the determinants of this parameter, we can examine the components of the Fick equation: Q = Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate C\"O! = Arterial O2 content: (1.39 [Hb] S\"O! + 0.003 PaO2) C#$O! = Mixed venous O2 content: (1.39 [Hb] S#$O!\\t + 0.003 P#$O!) where Several factors are required to maximize oxygen uptake: Ventilation to deliver oxygen to the alveoli Gas exchange to move oxygen from the alveoli to the blood Oxygen carriage by hemoglobin Cardiac output to deliver oxygenated blood to the tissues Oxygen delivery to the muscle mitochondria to generate ATP Muscle contraction to perform the sustained exercise The higher VO2max, the more effective these systems are at performing their might have a VO2max of 35-40 ml/kg/min, elite cross country skiers may have a VO2max of 85 ml/kg/min, while severely limited patients with cardiomyopathy or tasks and the greater the person\\'s exercise capacity. Maximum oxygen uptake varies from individual to individual. Whereas an average 30 year-old person COPD may only achieve 15 ml/kg/min. Maximal oxygen uptake declines with age, although that decline is slowed in physically active subjects. Assessment of maximal oxygen uptake provides insight into the adequacy of cardiac output. To understand why, refer back to the Fick Equation above. In individuals with and without cardiac disease, about 80% of the oxygen is extracted from arterial blood at maximal exercise. In other words, the arterio- venous oxygen content difference (C\"O!-C#$O!) is the same across healthy the variability seen between individuals in VO2max is determined by cardiac output and we can conclude that the higher the patient\\'s VO2max the higher the cardiac output and vice versa. VO2max does not provide a quantitative measure of cardiac individuals and patients with cardiac disease at maximum exercise. As a result, output itself, but is proportional to that measurement, unless the individual has significant anemia. EXERCISE RESPONSES IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS We now examine the physiologic responses to exercise in healthy individuals (i.e., those without cardiopulmonary disease). As the power output is increased at a steady ready rate, key physiologic parameters change in a characteristic manner. 2  14 \\nOxygen Uptake and Hemodynamic Changes Oxygen Uptake (VO2): increases linearly as work rate increases until a plateau is reached at maximal effort (Figure 14-1A). Because VO2 tracks perfectly with continue exercise for very long once they reach VO2max, although highly fit power output, the terms maximal oxygen uptake, maximal power output or maximal exercise capacity are used interchangeably. Individuals cannot individuals can sustain this level of exercise longer than sedentary subjects. Figure 14-1: Physiologic responses to exercise in healthy individuals. Cardiac Output: As work rate increases, cardiac output increases in a linear manner before leveling off near peak exercise. Heart Rate: increases in a linear manner as work rate or VO2 increase until peak exercise when it plateaus (Figure 14-1B). In healthy individuals, this plateau ordinarily is observed at the person\\'s age predicted maximum heart rate (220 - age). However, this prediction equation represents an average response, and healthy individuals may be above or below the age-predicted maximum by as much as 20 or 30 beats per minute. Stroke Volume: During upright exercise, two pumps facilitate cardiac output: the heart pumping blood into the aorta, and the capacitance veins and their valves in the calves, pumping blood back into the vena cava. Stroke volume, increases at the onset of exercise, primarily due to mobilization of blood in the venous capacitance vessels in the legs. In the later stages of exercise stroke volume increases only minimally due to increased inotropic activity. Systemic Blood Pressure: increases progressively with exercise. It is not uncommon for healthy individuals to have systolic pressure rise into the 200 mm Hg range at peak exercise. The increase in blood pressure is due to the increase  14 3 \\nin cardiac output and the increase in vascular resistance in the renal, splanchnic and skin vascular beds, which counteracts the decrease in vascular resistance in the exercising muscles. Pulmonary Artery Pressure: Pulmonary artery pressure increases only modestly with maximal exercise because recruitment and distention of the pulmonary vasculature in response to increasing cardiac output and pulmonary blood flow decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. This was described in Chapter 13. Ventilatory Responses During a CPET, healthy individuals demonstrate an important finding in mid-late exercise known as the ventilatory threshold. This is the point in the test where a number of ventilatory parameters exhibit a threshold-like response during progressive exercise. It is temporally related to the development of a lactic acidosis and is also called the \"lactate threshold\" or \"anaerobic threshold.\" Although the term was originally thought to represent the development of muscle hypoxia in the late exercise, it turns out that lactate levels rise as a result of a more complex process than simply anaerobic metabolism. While opinions differ on the functional significance of events in muscle leading to lactic acidosis, there is agreement that the ventilatory threshold identifies a level of exertion where blood flow to the exercising muscle is no longer able to completely meet the metabolic demands. The trends in several parameters change around the time of the ventilatory threshold, particularly minute ventilation (V%; Figure 14-1B). In early exercise, minute ventilation increases linearly as power output and VO2 increase due to effort, V% rises at a much faster rate. At maximal exercise, the respiratory rate is 60% of the person\\'s vital capacity. In healthy individuals, V% at maximal exercise reserve.\" Very fit athletes with high cardiac outputs, however, can raise their V% to increases in both respiratory rate and tidal volume. With the onset of the ventilatory threshold at about two-thirds of the way through a maximal exercise is usually well below their maximum estimated ventilatory capacity (see the Appendix to this chapter) and we say the person has a large \"ventilatory typically 40 to 50 breaths per minute while the tidal volume plateaus at about levels at or near their estimated maximum ventilatory capacity. Gas Exchange Characteristic changes also occur in several parameters related to gas exchange due to changes in minute ventilation and pulmonary blood flow. Carbon Dioxide Tensions: Both PACO2 and PaCO2 remain relatively constant during early exercise because alveolar ventilation increases at the same rate as the rise in carbon dioxide production. Once the ventilatory threshold is reached, the developing metabolic acidosis triggers an increase in minute and alveolar ventilation that is out of proportion to the continuing increase in carbon dioxide production. This leads to a decrease in both PACO2 and PaCO2 (compensatory respiratory alkalosis; Figure 14-1C). 4  14 \\n Parameter VO2 Cardiac output Heart rate Stroke volume Blood pressure PA pressure VD/VT PAO2 PaO2 SaO2 (A-a)ΔO2 PaCO2 pH R Oxygen Tensions: The PaO2 is relatively constant throughout exercise (Figure 14-1C). The normal decrease in PaCO2 and the rise in PAO2 after the ventilatory threshold would be expected to cause an increase in PaO2, but this is not observed. In fact, healthy subjects show an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [(A-a)ΔO2] with a maximal effort, explaining why both arterial PaO2 and SaO2 remain constant throughout a normal maximal exercise. A small subset of very accomplished aerobic athletes show a decrease in PaO2 at peak exercise, a finding that has been attributed to true diffusion impairment for oxygen between the alveolar surface and the rapidly transiting capillary erythrocytes due to the very high cardiac output seen in these athletes. Arterial pH: remains constant until the ventilatory threshold when it begins to fall because the increase in minute ventilation is not sufficient to fully compensate for the developing metabolic acidosis. Dead Space Fraction (VD/VT): In healthy individuals, VD/VT is 0.30 to 0.35 at rest and declines to around 0.15 to 0.20 at end-exercise. The primary reason is that with exercise, tidal volume (VT) increases. Because the volume of the anatomic deadspace is largely constant, the ratio of VD to VT gets smaller. In addition, as recruitment and distention of pulmonary vessels occurs with increasing pulmonary blood flow, there is better ventilation-perfusion matching. Respiratory Exchange Ratio (R): this is the ratio of CO2 production to O2 ). At rest, R depends on the balance between fat and carbohydrate metabolism, and usually ranges from 0.72 to 0.9. With increasing exercise, carbohydrate utilization becomes a progressively larger fraction of the metabolic fuel and R increases progressively. After the onset of the ventilatory threshold, CO2 elimination rises to a greater extent than oxygen consumption and R rises to levels as high as 1.1 to 1.3. A summary of the physiological responses to exercise in healthy individuals described above is provided in Table 14-1. consumption (VCO!

Hence, conditioning programs are helpful even for very impaired patients. However, while the increases in muscle strength and endurance with training programs can be significant, the improvement achieved ̇O2max is relatively modest. Generally, an unfit subject can increase \\tV ̇O2max in \\tV ̇O2max and create an Olympic-level cross- sedentary individual with an average \\tV ̇O2max cannot improve their country skier. Likewise even athletes with very high \\tV ̇O2max much even with more intensive training. What improves with intensive \\tV by about 15-25% with intensive training over several months. However, regardless of the duration or rigor of the training effort, you cannot take a training is exercise efficiency, the ability to sustain high work rates and the ability to recover quickly from repeated sets of maximal exercise. EXERCISE RESPONSES IN PATIENTS WITH CARDIOPULMONARY DISEASE Dyspnea on exertion is a cardinal manifestation of many diseases. Many patients discount the importance of this symptom, particularly as they age, and do not perceive loss of exercise tolerance as a significant issue. \"I\\'m just getting older, I guess\" is a typical response heard in clinic. However, dyspnea is a very sensitive marker of cardiopulmonary disease, and questions about exercise tolerance should be part of any screening medical history. For any given age there is a wide range of exercise capacities in the general population, so you cannot rely on the absolute amount of exercise a patient reports and instead must always compare their current performance to their past performance. A middle-aged man who used to mow his lawn without stopping but now takes two or three breaks to catch his breath is one example. A different example would be a competitive runner who states her marathon time is now 3.25 hours whereas 6 months ago she ran the same distance in 2.75 hours with no change in her training regimen in between. Both of those stories in very different patients clearly reflect problems that merit further medical attention. When patients present to clinic with dyspnea on exertion or exercise limitation and the etiology of the problem is not apparent on initial evaluation, CPET can be used to identify the cause of the patient\\'s problem. The test is useful in this regard because patients with different forms of disease (e.g., cardiovascular or obstructive lung disease) display characteristic patterns of results on their exercise test. The majority of patients fall into one of three patterns of exercise responses, defined by the primary system limiting exercise: Cardiac Limitation In this group of patients, exercise is limited by the amount of oxygenated blood that can be delivered by the heart to the exercising muscles. In such individuals, the heart reaches the limits of what it can do before the ventilatory or pulmonary vascular systems fail. On a cardiopulmonary exercise test, these individuals demonstrate a clear ventilatory threshold. R rises above 1.0 at the threshold. The heart rate at peak exercise rise to or just below the maximum predicted heart 6  14 \\n rate. They develop a lactic acidosis after the ventilatory threshold and, in response, increase their ventilation significantly. At peak exercise, however, minute ventilation is still far below the predicted maximum, indicating that the ventilatory pump has not reached the limit of what it can do. Despite the increase in the PAO2 that occurs as a result of this, the PaO2 does not increase because the (A-a)ΔO2 widens. They stop exercising due to leg fatigue, as the heart can no longer deliver enough oxygenated blood to the muscles. These characteristic features are described in Table 14-1 and shown graphically in Figure 14-2. Note that healthy individuals display a pattern of results on exercise testing similar to individuals with cardiac disease. This is because healthy individuals are, in fact, \"cardiac limited\" by the amount of oxygenated blood that can be delivered to exercising muscle. What distinguishes the exercise test patterns in these two groups of individuals is that healthy people achieve a higher work rate, ̇O2max, and maximum heart rate and reach their ventilatory threshold later in \\tV exercise than the patients with cardiovascular disease. Figure 14-2: Characteristic changes in various parameters in different forms of exercise limitation. Note that the healthy individual (solid black line) achieves a higher work rate near the predicted maximum compared to the patient with cardiac limitation due to disease (grey line) or the patient with ventilatory limitation (grey dotted line). The trends are more important than the specific numerical values in these examples. Pulmonary vascular limitation is not shown. The subscript ET refers to end-tidal values which are used as a surrogate measure of the alveolar values. Ventilatory Limitation In this group of patients, exercise is limited by problems with the ventilatory pump. In other words, the respiratory system reaches the limits of its ventilatory  14 7 \\ncapacity well before the heart or pulmonary vascular system reach their limits. Because the lungs fail before the heart fails, these individuals do not manifest a ventilatory threshold or a lactic acidosis. In fact, at end-exercise, PaCO2 rises because the patient cannot generate enough minute and alveolar ventilation to keep up with the increased CO2 production. Instead of having a primary metabolic acidosis, they have a primary respiratory acidosis. Unlike in patients with cardiac limitation, their minute ventilation at peak exercise is also very close to their predicted maximum ventilation (ie a small-absent ventilatory reserve). R never crosses above 1.0. They typically stop exercising due to dyspnea that develops due to air-trapping (dynamic hyperinflation) as well as the rising PaCO2. Examples of diseases that might cause this pattern of exercise limitation would be COPD or a neuromuscular disease with respiratory muscle involvement. These characteristic features are described in Table 14-2 and shown graphically in Figure 14-2. Table 14-2. Physiologic Responses to Exercise in Healthy Individuals and Patients with The Major Patterns of Exercise Limitation Variable VO2max Ventilatory Threshold Cardiac Limitation in a Healthy Person Cardiac Limitation in a Patient With Cardiac Disease Ventilatory Limitation Pulmonary Vascular Limitation Normal * Decreased Decreased Decreased Present Present Absent Present Oxygen Saturation Stable Stable May Decrease Decreases PaCO2 (at end-exercise) Metabolic acidosis (at end-exercise) Dead Space Fraction (VD/VT) Reason for stopping exercise Decreasing Decreasing Rising Decreasing Present Present Absent Present Decreases Decreases Stable or decreased Leg fatigue Leg fatigue Dyspnea Stable or increased Dyspnea and/or leg fatigue * \"Normal\" or \"decreased\" refers to how the variable changes relative to age, gender and size matched individuals. Pulmonary Vascular Limitation In this group of patients, the major problem is the inability of the pulmonary vascular system to recruit and distend previously underutilized vessels in response to increasing pulmonary blood flow during exercise. These patients demonstrate many of the same responses to exercise as patients with cardiac limitation with two key differences. First, because of limited ability to raise cardiac output and the inability to recruit and distend pulmonary vessels, the dead-space fraction remains unchanged or increases with increasing exercise. Second, gas 8  14 \\n exchange is impaired leading to decreases in PaO2 and SaO2, which are not seen in cardiac limitation. Patients with interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, show similar changes on exercise testing as the pulmonary vascular disease patients. A simplified scheme for interpreting data from cardiopulmonary exercise tests and determining the pattern of limitation is shown in Figure 14-3. In clinical practice, the process of determining the system limiting exercise can be considerably more complicated than that reflected in this figure but such detail is beyond the learning objectives of this course. Figure 14-3: A simplified algorithm for determining the primary system limiting exercise on a cardiopulmonary exercise test. AN EXAMPLE OF CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TEST INTERPRETATION To better understand how we use cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine the system limiting an individual\\'s exercise capacity, consider the following case: A 66 year-old man COPD (FEV1 35% predicted) is found to have aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.95 cm2 during an evaluation for worsening dyspnea. His cardiologist is not sure whether to have him undergo valve surgery. If they fix his valve, but he is still very limited by his lung disease, he may not experience any symptomatic benefit for cardiopulmonary exercise testing to assess whether to proceed with surgical repair. The results from his test are displayed below:  14 the surgery. He from undergoing is referred 9 \\nVariable V O2 (ml/kg/min) V E (L/min) HR (bpm) PaO2 PaCO2 VD/VT Ventilatory Threshold Reason For Stopping End-Exercise % Predicted 13.3 121 38 70 44 0.30 65 74 98 N/A N/A N/A Rest 3.5 91 10 88 39 0.38 Absent Dyspnea Take some time to examine the data and see which system you think is limiting his ability to exercise. The results from this test indicate that he has a ventilatory pattern of limitation. A ventilatory threshold could not be identified, and he has a rising PaCO2, and a small ventilatory reserve at end-exercise. The rising PaCO2 is particularly significant as it tells us that the patient does not have the ventilatory capacity necessary to raise alveolar ventilation enough to eliminate all of the CO2 produced by his exercising muscles. The rising PCO2 causes significant dyspnea in these patients, which is the main reason he stopped exercising. The airflow obstruction on exhalation in conjunction with the increased respiratory rate and shortened exhalation time also lead to significant air-trapping during exercise, which further contributes to the severe dyspnea on exertion (Figure 14-4). Figure 14-4: A simplified algorithm for determining the primary system limiting exercise on a cardiopulmonary exercise test as applied to the sample case Overall, these results indicate that his exercise capacity is limited by COPD rather than aortic stenosis or coronary artery disease. It would not be appropriate to proceed with valve repair at this time. Even if the valve were repaired 10  14 \\n to successfully, he would continue to have severe exercise limitation following surgery due to his COPD.THE EFFECT OF TRAINING IN INDIVIDUALS WITH UNDERLYING CARDIOPULMONARY DISEASE When people have exercise limitation for one of the broad reasons described above, training programs may yield benefits including improvements in their maximum exercise capacity as well as in their ability to sustain and tolerate physical work. For example, pulmonary rehabilitation programs have been extensively studied in patients with COPD and have been demonstrated to improve exercise capacity, perceived intensity of breathlessness and quality of life, while decreasing hospitalizations and depression. Hence, although these programs have not been demonstrated improve either spirometry measurements or mortality, they are safe and do improve overall functional capacity to perform activities of daily living. THE SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST A simple test that is commonly used to gauge a patient\\'s exercise tolerance is the 6-minute walk test. A respiratory therapist walks with the patient and measures how much distance they can cover in a period of 6 minutes walking as fast as they can tolerate. This test is simple and inexpensive compared to a cardiopulmonary exercise test, but it provides no diagnostic information (in other words, it cannot tell you which system is limiting exercise). It is most helpful to examine responses to treatment for patients who are extremely impaired by their heart or lung disease but is not useful for assessing exercise capacity in minimally impaired or healthy patients. The distance walked on a 6-minute walk test is often used as an end-point in many studies of pharmacologic interventions in various forms of pulmonary disease such as pulmonary arterial hypertension. Appendix: Estimating Maximum Ventilation You will not be responsible for this information on the examination in this course. To derive an estimate of the patient\\'s maximum ventilatory capacity, we measure what we refer to as the Maximum Voluntary Ventilation (MVV). Patients are instructed to take maximal breaths in and out as fast at they can for 12 seconds using the same type of spirometer used for a forced vital capacity maneuver. The machine records the ventilation during this time period, which is then is multiplied by 5 to give an estimate of the maximum ventilation they can achieve in one minute. The maximum minute ventilation an individual can generate can also be predicted by multiplying their FEV1 by 40.  14 11 \\n 12  14 \\n Chapter 15 Respiratory Infections INTRODUCTION Respiratory infections can vary in severity from those causing minimally bothersome symptoms to those causing life-threatening respiratory failure. In this chapter we discuss the basic defenses against infectious and non-infectious foreign invaders and then consider several major forms of respiratory infection. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Outline the primary defense mechanisms of the respiratory system including anatomic defenses, defensive reflexes and defenses in the alveolar space Describe the typical time course and management of acute bronchitis Describe the causes of pneumonia in different clinical settings and outline a treatment approach appropriate for each setting Describe the clinical and radiographic features of tuberculosis and diagnostic and treatment strategies for latent and active infection Outline the common respiratory infections in HIV-positive patients and the relationship between CD-4 count and the risk of these infections Describe the clinical features and management of important pediatric respiratory tract infections Some of this content was covered previously in your Invaders and Defenders course. We are revisiting it in this course because the burden of respiratory infections is very high and there is value in reinforcing these concepts. RESPIRATORY SYSTEM DEFENSES There are three primary components to respiratory system defenses against both infectious and non-infectious foreign invaders: (1) anatomic defenses, (2) airway reflexes and (3) alveolar space defenses. Knowledge of these defenses is important to understand the diseases that result when the defenses break down. Anatomic Defenses Several anatomic features play a key role in the respiratory system defenses: The Nose This is the first line of defense for the respiratory system. Hair fibers at the entrance to each nasal passage intercept large particles (> 25 um) before they move into the twisting nasal passages that immediately follow (Figure 15-1). Nasopharyngeal Air Passages The nasopharyngeal air passages consist of a series of narrow, twisting channels (Figure 15-2) that, along with high air velocity, promote deposition of particles in the nasal mucosa. Once air moves through the nasal passages, the sharp nasopharyngeal angle further increases the likelihood of particle deposition by impaction due to inertial forces.  15 1 \\nFigure 15-1: Hair fibers at the entrance to the nasal passages that intercept large particles. Figure 15-2: Nasopharyngeal defenses. This single slice of a coronal view of a CT scan of the head demonstrates the narrow, twisting channels of the nasal air passages that increase the probability of particle deposition in the nasal mucosa. The Larynx Closure of the glottis (the slit-like opening to the trachea) prevents gross aspiration of oral or gastric contents, although micro-aspiration of smaller amounts of material is still possible and often occurs on a silent basis. Tracheobronchial Tree Each branch in the airway as you move from the trachea to the alveoli is a potential point of defense, as high velocity, high particle mass contaminants tend to impact the mucosa in these regions due to centrifugal forces (Figure 15-3). Figure 15-3: Mechanisms by which air contaminants deposit in the respiratory tract. The main airflow track for mechanism 1 is depicted by the dotted line. 2  15 \\nLarger particles moving at slower speeds tend to settle on the respiratory surface due to the effects of gravity. This system is not foolproof, however, as gases and small particles moving at low velocity can enter the alveolar space through the process of diffusion. Mucociliary Escalator The respiratory epithelium below the larynx is lined with ciliated columnar epithelial cells. The cilia beat in a coordinated manner of wave-like sweeps that move secretions in the peripheral airways towards the mouth where they are eliminated by coughing or swallowing. In certain diseases, mucociliary function is impaired leading to inadequate airway clearance, increased risk of infection and other problems such as bronchiectasis. Mucociliary function also decreases due to cigarette smoking and as a result of normal aging, with subsequent increases in the risk of infection. Which defense mechanism plays a role for any given contaminant is determined to a significant degree by the size and mass of the particle and the speed of travel (Table 15-1) Note that there is minimum deposition of particles with diameters of 0.3-0.7 um where none of these mechanisms are effective. Table 15-1: Physical Mechanisms of Contaminant Deposition Mechanism Inertia-Impaction Inertia-Settling Favorable Conditions High velocity, high particle mass, sharp turns Low velocity, high particle mass, small air spaces Diffusion Interception Low velocity, low particle mass, high concentration gradient Occurs with nasal turbinates and hair fibers Typical Particle Size > 10 um > 10 um Particles < 0.1 um and gases and vapors ≥ 25 um Defensive Airway Reflexes Several airway reflexes also protect the respiratory tract from contaminants. Laryngeal Closure Reflex In response to deglutition or noxious inhaled stimuli, the glottic and supraglottic sphincters contract causing the vocal cords, false cords, and arytenoids to move medially and occlude the airway thereby preventing entry of food or other contaminants into the lower airway. The vagus, recurrent laryngeal and superior laryngeal nerves play a role in the afferent and efferent pathways of this reflex. Cough Reflex This important reflex leads to rapid, mass movement of secretions and foreign material from the conducting airways and clears material from the supraglottic area. Although the mucociliary escalator is the major method of airway clearance in healthy people, cough is an important reserve mechanism, particularly in the setting of lung disease. Three factors are necessary to generate a strong cough:  15 3 \\n Inspiratory muscle strength: Inspiration to high lung volume improves expiratory muscle efficiency by stretching muscles to optimal length, increasing lung elastic recoil and opening airways in preparation for the expiratory phase. Expiratory muscle strength: The effectiveness of cough depends on peak airflow during the expiratory phase, which is a function of patient effort and the ability of expiratory muscles to generate adequate compressive forces. Glottic Closure: Contraction of the expiratory muscles during glottic closure leads to a large rise in intra-alveolar and airway pressures. As a result, when the glottis opens at the start of the \"explosive\" or \"expulsive\" phase, there is a large pressure gradient between the lower airways and the mouth that leads to a rapid increase in expiratory airflow and elimination of mucous and other contaminants (Figure 15-4). This is akin to isovolumic contraction of the left ventricle at the start of systole (contraction when the aortic valve remains closed). In the absence of effective glottic closure, airway pressure does not rise to adequate levels and sufficient expiratory flow rates cannot be generated due to the smaller pressure gradient and clearance is impaired. Figure 15-4: The physiology of cough. Upon contraction of the expiratory muscles, airway pressure (dotted line) increases while the glottis is closed. Airflow (solid line) does not occur until the glottis opens, at which point it rapidly rises before declining over the rest of the \"explosive\" phase. Redrawn from: Bianco & Robuschi: Mechanisms of Cough. In Braga and Allegra eds: Cough. New York: Raven, 1989. Another key aspect of cough is that as a result of the rise in pleural pressure, airway diameter narrows due to the change in transmural pressure across the airway wall. Air velocity increases due to the narrower diameter. This creates shear forces that move secretions and particulate matter off the airway wall towards the mouth. Problems with any of these factors due to, for example, spinal cord injuries, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury or ischemic stroke cause ineffective cough and predispose to mucous plugging, atelectasis and infection. Alveolar Space Defenses There are three primary forms of defense in the alveolar space: Resident Alveolar Macrophages Alveolar macrophages are the main cells in the alveolar spaces of the normal lung. They are active phagocytes, ingesting inorganic and organic particles and either 4  15 \\ndigesting them, or carrying them out of the airspaces. Stimulation of macrophage receptors by particulates causes release of chemotactic factors that recruit immune cells from the blood stream to the lungs and amplify the inflammatory response. Alveolar macrophages also play a role in the repair of lung injury by stimulating fibroblast growth and, possibly, collagen synthesis. Alveolar Fluid IgG is the major immunoglobulin in the alveolar space with very small amounts of IgA, IgM and complement (IgA is the major immunoglobin in the respiratory secretions above the larynx). IgM, IgG and complement components can diffuse from the plasma into the airspaces during inflammatory states that increase alveolar membrane permeability or are produced locally by recruited lymphocytes. IgG and IgM serve as opsonins, which enhance the phagocytosis of particles and bacteria by alveolar macrophages, neutrophils and monocytes. a-1 antitrypsin is also present in the alveolar spaces and neutralizes proteases secreted by macrophages and neutrophils in the airway, thereby providing an anti-protease balance in lung fluids. Finally, in addition to its role in decreasing surface tension, surfactant augments bacterial killing by alveolar macrophages. Recruited Cells Effector cells from the bloodstream and systemic lymphoid tissue are recruited to the lung in response to signals derived from alveolar macrophages, bacteria, and complement activation in the airspaces. Blood neutrophils and monocytes are more mobile and have more potent antibacterial mechanisms than resident alveolar macrophages. Monocytes evolve into \"activated\\' macrophages as they migrate into inflamed tissues and the activation process augments their antibacterial effector functions. Recruited B-lymphocytes produce specific antibody within the airspaces while T-cells augment cell-mediated immunity. Having reviewed the primary forms of defense, we now consider the major categories of respiratory infection. ACUTE BRONCHITIS Definition Acute bronchitis (AB) is characterized by acute inflammation of the lower respiratory epithelium or tracheobronchial mucosa. By definition, it occurs in persons without underlying chronic airway disease. Pathophysiology AB is caused by acute, self-limited infection by respiratory viruses, such as influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as bacterial pathogens including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis, that have the ability to bind to and/or invade human respiratory epithelial cells. AB is spread between individuals via contact or droplet exposure rather than airborne inhalation. Clinical Features AB may be difficult to distinguish from isolated upper respiratory infection (URI) in  15 5 \\nits early stages. Many patients have both simultaneously. AB is characterized by cough, which can be productive of sputum. Wheezing and bronchospasm are common even in patients without asthma. Symptoms related to rhinitis, laryngitis, or pharyngitis may be present. Fever is unusual and should suggest more serious infections such as influenza or pneumonia. Diagnosis AB is a clinical diagnosis, based on the typical clinical features in a patient without chronic lung disease. In patients with cough < 3 weeks duration, it is important to exclude alternative diagnoses such as inhalation injury, acute asthma, and aspirated foreign body. Focal chest exam findings should raise concern for pneumonia and prompt chest radiography. No specific viral or microbiology testing is warranted except in special circumstances such as following exposure to pertussis or with suspected influenza. Treatment Treatment of AB is largely symptomatic. Bronchodilators may improve symptoms whereas antibiotic treatment does not (Figure 15-5). Figure 15-5: Data from a randomized trial of antibiotic use for acute bronchitis. Subjects received a one-week course of doxycycline or placebo. There were no differences in any study outcomes between the two groups. Figure adapted from: Williamson HA.A randomized controlled trial of doxycycline in the treatment of acute bronchitis. J Fam Pract 1984. 19(4): 481-6. Despite this, up to three-quarters of patients who seek care for AB receive antibiotics. This practice is costly and contributes to antibiotic resistance. Patient expectations regarding antibiotics can be alleviated by careful counseling. The exception is patients with confirmed pertussis who should receive a macrolide antibiotic (e.g., azithromycin or clarithromycin). PNEUMONIA Definition Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma, involving the distal acinus and alveoli. Whereas pneumonias previously have been classified by clinical syndrome (typical versus atypical pneumonia), anatomic distribution (lobar pneumonia versus bronchopneumonia), and pathogenesis (aspiration versus inhalation), they are now classified on the basis of the clinical circumstances (community-acquired, hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, opportunistic), the medical comorbidities of the patient, and the initial severity, as these factors help predict the microbial cause and guide empiric antibiotic treatment. 6  15 \\nEpidemiology The most common predisposing factors include advanced age, cigarette smoking, COPD, bronchiectasis, bronchial obstruction, strokes, seizures, intoxication, immunosuppression, tracheal intubation, and other medical comorbidities. Even in the absence of such factors, healthy people can develop pneumonia when exposed to a highly virulent pathogen. Pathophysiology Determinants of Infection Pneumonia develops with defects in lung host defenses (Table 15-2), after exposure to a large inoculum of organisms that overwhelms defenses, or after infection with a highly virulent pathogen. While the most common mechanism is micro-aspiration of colonized or infected upper respiratory secretions, pneumonia also occurs due to inhalation of airborne infectious particles, aspiration, hematogenous spread, and direct invasion from a contiguous site of infection. Table 15-2: Risk factors for pneumonia according to host defense defect Host Defense Defect Risk Factor For Pneumonia Loss of anatomic defenses Endotracheal intubation; glottic dysfunction Blunted protective reflexes Stroke, seizure, alcoholism, drug intoxication, Weak cough Impaired mucociliary clearance Weakened immunologic defenses anesthesia, neuromuscular disease Spinal cord injury, neuromuscular disease, COPD, airway obstruction Smoking, viral infection, COPD, bronchiectasis, inherited ciliary disorders, airway obstruction HIV, transplant, immunosuppressive therapy, alcoholism, malnutrition Physiologic Effects of Pneumonia Pneumonia is characterized histologically by acute parenchymal inflammation with inflammatory exudates filling the alveolar spaces (Figure 15-6). This leads to consolidation of the involved lung region. Ventilation of the affected lung is impaired by a regional decrease in lung compliance and by actual filling of the alveolar spaces with pus and exudates. Hypoxemia develops due to shunt from blood flow through the consolidated area and low VA/Q due to airway secretions. Figure 15-6: Histologic section of lung parenchyma from an area of pneumonia. Note the thickened alveolar septae and filling of the alveolar spaces by acute inflammatory cells and exudates. The normal alveolar air spaces are missing entirely. Common Pneumonia Pathogens Pneumonia is caused by many types of organisms (Table 15-3) bearing specific  15 7 \\nvirulence factors that allow them to invade the lung and evade host defenses such as the ability to bind to the respiratory epithelium, paralyze ciliary movement, impair mucus clearance, and destroy host leukocytes, immunoglobulins and other defense proteins. Table 15-3: Common Bacterial Causes of Pneumonia Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) Mild Streptococcus pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydophila pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus species Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Severe (in ICU) Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella spp. Staphylococcus aureus Gram negative bacilli (sensitive) Enterobacter species Pseudomonas aeruginosa Acinetobacter species Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia In any given case, the most likely causative organism is a function of the severity of presentation, where it develops and in cases of hospitalized patients, the duration of hospital stay and use of prior antibiotics. The community-acquired pathogens are commonly divided into \"typical\" (eg Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae) and \"atypical,\" with the latter term referring to organisms (legionella, chlamydophila, mycoplasma) that cannot be detected with standard diagnostic tests and are not susceptible to traditional beta-lactam antibiotics. The clinical features of individual cases are not helpful in distinguishing between typical and atypical organisms. Influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and varicella are traditional viral pathogens that cause primary pneumonia, while hantavirus, and the SARS, SARS-CoV2 and MERS coronaviruses are recognized viral causes of severe pneumonia. Sometimes, respiratory viruses infect the airways and predispose patients to a subsequent bacterial pneumonia. A common scenario is the development of Staph pneumonia following influenza infection. The incidence of fungal pneumonia varies greatly according to geographic location. For instance, histoplasmosis occurs predominantly in the river valleys of central North America, while coccidioidomycosis occur predominantly in the desert southwest. Cryptococcosis (Cryptococcus neoformans) and aspergillosis occur across a broader geographic distribution. While fungal pneumonia can occur in immunocompetent individuals, severe disease is more likely to occur in those with various forms of immunosuppression. Clinical Features Pneumonia is usually an acute illness characterized by fever, productive cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Constitutional symptoms such as malaise, fatigue, and myalgias may also occur. Severe cases may cause respiratory distress, confusion, and obtundation. Physical exam findings may include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, altered mental status, and signs of lung consolidation (dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, increased fremitus, and egophony). Other 8  15 \\nfindings may be present if the pneumonia is complicated by parapneumonic pleural effusion or septic shock. As a general rule, younger previously healthy patients are more likely to have the classic symptoms of fever, cough, and chest pain whereas older or immunocompromised patients are more likely to present with nonspecific findings such as confusion and hypoxemia Diagnosis The diagnosis of pneumonia is based on the presence of typical symptoms, focal chest exam findings and/or focal lung opacities on chest imaging (Figure 15-7). Figure 15-7: Chest radiographs from a patient with community-acquired pneumonia. The white arrows point to the opacity in the posterior regions of the right lower lobe. Note the retrocardiac location on the lateral film. The traditional approach to identifying the cause of pneumonia has been to perform Gram stain and culture on expectorated sputum and blood cultures, but the microbial cause of pneumonia is determined in only 50% of cases. Many patients are unable to expectorate sputum, which is often contaminated by oropharyngeal bacteria. Blood cultures are positive in less than 10% of cases. Antigen detection (eg urinary legionella or streptococcal antigen) and nucleic acid amplification tests have improved the sensitivity, and specificity of the diagnostic approach, particularly for atypical pathogens that are not visible on Gram stain and do not grow on standard culture media. In patients suspected of developing pneumonia while receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, cultures are typically performed on sputum samples aspirated from the endotracheal tube or bronchoalveolar lavage samples obtained by bronchoscopy. Treatment The key to treatment is prompt, appropriate antibiotic administration. Diagnostic test results are not available at the time treatment is started and empiric therapy is chosen based on the clinical setting, severity of illness and local resistance patterns (Table 15-4). In addition, hospitalized patients with pneumonia often require supportive care including oxygen, assistance with secretion clearance and, sometimes, mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic support.  15 9 \\nTable 15-4.

Inpatients, not in ICU Inpatients in ICU LUNG ABSCEss Necrosis of the lung parenchyma in the setting of bacterial infection can lead to development of pus-filled cavitary lesions referred to as lung abscesses. Pathogenesis Most lung abscesses develop as a result of aspiration of oral secretions and are typically polymicrobial in nature. The most common organisms are anaerobic flora of the oral cavity including peptostreptococcus, prevotella, bacteroides and fusobacterium, although Staphylococcus aureus infections are also seen. Rarely, multiple small abscesses develop due to endocarditis of the triscupid valve or septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (Lemierre\\'s syndrome), a phenomenon referred to as septic pulmonary embolism. Presentation Unlike in routine bacterial pneumonia, patients with lung abscess due to oral aspiration present in an indolent manner with cough, fever and sputum production over a period of weeks to months. Figure 15-8: Lung Abscess on Plain Radiograph (A) and Chest CT (B). In Panel A, the dotted white circle outlines the cavitary lesion. The black dotted line highlights the air-fluid level, the boundary between the area of lucency above and opacity below (the fluid in the cavity) 10  15 \\nImaging The hallmark of a lung abscess on chest imaging is a cavitary lesion with an air- fluid level (Figure 15-8). Treatment Unlike a soft-tissue abscess in the leg or arm, for example, that must be treated with incision and drainage, most lung abscesses can be treated with long-courses of antibiotics that cover anaerobic organisms. This is because most abscesses communicate with an airway allowing drainage of pus via expectoration (coughing). Very large abscesses, those with an obstructed bronchus or those due to very resistant organisms may require surgical drainage. TUBERCULOSIS Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused primarily by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (but also M.Bovis and several other species) that typically involves the lung but can affect any organ in the body. Pathophysiology of TB (Transmission and Pathogenesis) M.tuberculosis is a small (0.3 x 4 um), rod-shaped bacterium spread person-to- person via airborne transmission via what are termed \"droplet nuclei.\" These are produced when a patient with active pulmonary or laryngeal tuberculosis breathes, sneezes or coughs. The aerosolized bacilli are initially suspended within fluid droplets of varying size. As the fluid evaporates it leaves a residual particle approximately 1-5 um in size that contains one or more viable organisms. Droplet nuclei of this size can remain suspended in the air for long periods of time and subsequently inhaled deep into the airways of an exposed person, where they may deposit in the alveoli. Figure 15-9 outlines the events and outcomes that follow exposure to M.tuberculosis. Figure 15-9: Events and Outcomes That Follow TB Exposure. Adapted from: Hopewell et al. Tuberculosis. In Murray and Nadel\\'s Textbook of Respiratory Medicine. 6th Edition.

Effective innate immune responses lead to immediate clearance of the organism while impaired responses lead to asymptomatic infection. Depending on the adequacy of the adaptive immune responses that follow, individuals either contain the infection in granulomas and remain asymptomatic (Figure 15-10) or develop signs of symptoms of active disease. Individuals who contain the infection and remain asymptomatic but have evidence of an adaptive immune response in the form of a positive TB skin test or interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are deemed to have latent TB infection (LTBI) whereas those who have immediate onset of active disease are often referred to as having \"primary TB.\" If adaptive immunity is impaired at any point following containment of the initial infection, previously latent bacteria can proliferate and cause active disease. This situation is referred to as \"reactivation TB.\" Unchecked bacterial growth can lead to disseminated disease. Figure 15-10: Caseating granuloma in the lung, of a patient with tuberculosis. Note the area of central caseation necrosis, which is not found with granulomas seen in sarcoidosis. The lifetime risk of reactivation is estimated to be 5-10% with the greatest risk within the first few years of the initial infection. Risk factors for reactivation center around defects in macrophage function or cell-mediated immunity. Early age (<2 years), alcoholism, malnutrition, diabetes, corticosteroid use, anti-TNF-alpha therapy, HIV infection, and other comorbidities, particularly chronic kidney disease, are considered primary risk factors for progression to active TB.Clinical Features The signs and symptoms depend on the patient\\'s immune status and whether the individual has primary, reactivation or extrapulmonary TB.Primary Tuberculosis Primary TB is seen mainly in children and immunocompromised hosts. Fever is the most common symptom in primary TB, although patients may also manifest cough, chest pain, fatigue and arthralgias. This is often mistaken for community acquired pneumonia and only becomes apparent when either the patient does not respond to treatment for community acquired pneumonia or a good exposure history is elicited. 12  15 \\nReactivation Tuberculosis The lungs are the most common sites of reactivation TB, which usually presents with three or more weeks of productive cough, fever, malaise, night sweats, and weight loss. Dyspnea, chest pain and hemoptysis are less common. Hemoptysis may be minor or massive and occurs due to either (1) mycotic pulmonary artery aneurysm when a pulmonary cavity erodes into a pulmonary artery (Rasmussen\\'s Aneurysm), (2) fungal or bacterial superinfection of a pre-existing cavity or bronchiectatic airway, and (3) erosion of a calcified lymph node into the bronchus. Extrapulmonary TB TB can manifest at numerous sites outside the lungs including lymph nodes, pleural space, kidneys, spine (Pott\\'s Disease), peritoneum, pericardium, meninges and others. TB pleuritis, the second most common form after lymphadenitis, presents with pleuritic chest pain and a unilateral, lymphocyte-rich exudative pleural effusion. Miliary TB results from lymphatic and hematogenous dissemination of the bacillus and may occur with reactivation or unchecked primary disease. The term miliary refers to the millet seed, a grain that resembles the small nodules seen on radiographs and in pathologic specimens. Patients typically present with constitutional symptoms including fever, anorexia fatigue, weight loss, and weakness, although cough and shortness of breath may also occur. Physical exam reveals less commonly splenomegaly, meningismus and altered mental status. Radiographic Features The radiographic findings vary based on the form of disease: Primary TB Patients classically have unilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and middle and/or lower lobe opacities (Figure 15-11). fevers, rales, hepatomegaly, and, Figure 15-11: In the leftmost film from a patient with primary TB, the white arrow points to the right hilar lymphadenopathy while the black arrow points to a middle lobe opacity. In the middle film, the white arrows point to cavitary lesions. Note the upward shift in the position of the minor fissure due to the upper lobe scarring or contraction. The film on the right demonstrates multiple, diffuse micronodular opacities.  15 13 \\nReactivation TB Typical findings include unilateral or bilateral upper lobe opacities, often associated with cavities or shift of the trachea, hilum or minor fissure in response to fibrosis and scarring related to TB.The presence of upper lobe cavitary lesions on chest imaging should always raise concern for TB (Figure 15-11). Miliary TB This typically demonstrates diffuse micronodular lesions (Figure 15-11) While the distinction has traditionally been made between the appearance of primary and reactivation TB on chest imaging, recent work has highlighted that in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, it can be difficult to distinguish between recent and remote TB infection based on the chest radiograph findings. Atypical radiographic appearances are particularly common in immunosuppressed patients, such as those with HIV.Diagnosis The diagnostic approach varies significantly depending on whether the goal is to identify a patient with LTBI or diagnose active TB.Latent TB Infection Diagnosis of LTBI is based on demonstrating evidence of TB-specific immunity and the absence of clinical or radiographic manifestations of active disease. There are two primary tests for this purpose: The Tuberculin Skin Test (TST): The diameter of induration is measured 48-72 hours after intradermal injection of a purified protein derivative (PPD). The induration represents a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction by lymphocytes sensitized to mycobacterial proteins by prior infection. Tests typically turn positive 2-10 weeks after acquisition of M.TB.False negative TSTs occur when the immune system is overwhelmed by active TB or impaired by HIV infection or other immunosuppression. False positive TSTs occur when lymphocytes have been sensitized to other, non-tuberculous mycobacteria including BCG vaccination. Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA): IGRAs use TB antigens to stimulate blood lymphocytes and measures interferon-gamma release by previously sensitized lymphocytes. They can be used in any situation in which you would consider using the TST and are particularly useful when people have received the BCG vaccine in the past because the assay is specific for M.TB.These tests are helpful when clearly positive or negative but are difficult to interpret when the result is near the cut-off for a positive test. Guidelines recommend IGRA for testing people at low-moderate risk of progression from LTBI to active TB while either TST or IGRA can be used in those with high risk of progression. Active Pulmonary TB Active TB is diagnosed by identifying the organism in either bodily secretions or biopsied tissue samples. Importantly, TST and IGRA have no role in the diagnosis of active TB.When positive, these tests only tell you the person has been exposed to TB in the past and not whether their active disease is due to TB or something 14  15 \\nelse. Furthermore, TST and IGRA are negative in about 20% of patients with active TB.Sputum AFB Smear: Sputum examination, using Ziehl-Neelson or Kinyoun stains (acid-fast stains) is helpful in diagnosing active TB.Sputum smears are not specific for M.TB (other mycobacteria take up the acid-fast stain) and lack sensitivity (up to 50% patients with culture-proven TB have negative sputum smears). Nucleic Acid Amplification (NAA): is used on sputum samples to improve sensitivity and specificity. In addition, because they are are highly specific for M.tuberculosis they can be used to rule out non-tuberculous mycobacteria in smear positive cases before culture results become available. Some of the currently available tests (eg Xpert MTB/RIF) also provide information regarding genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. Mycobacterial Culture: Culture is the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis, but can take 2-6 weeks to turn positive. Positive cultures can be confirmed as being M.tuberculosis using TB-specific DNA probes, or genetic sequencing approaches and are tested for drug susceptibility. Importantly, because smears may be negative and culture can take many weeks to turn positive, patients can be started on treatment while awaiting culture results if the clinical suspicion for TB is high enough. TB Treatment Active TB All suspected and confirmed cases of TB must be reported to the Public Health department and no provider should manage active TB without consulting TB control experts. The standard of care is directly observed therapy (DOT), in which each dose is taken under the observation of a public health worker. The most important treatment principle for active TB is to use at least two different drugs to which the isolate is susceptible to decrease the likelihood of developing drug resistance. Treatment regimens consist of an initiation phase and a continuation phase. The standard regimen worldwide is shown in Table 15-5. Table 15-5: Standard Treatment Regimen for Susceptible Tuberculosis. Drugs Isoniazid (INH) Rifampin (RIF) Pyrazinamide (PZA) Ethambutol (EMB) Initiation Phase (First 2 Months) x X x X Continuation Phase (Last 4 Months) x X Second line anti-tuberculous drugs are used in cases of drug resistance and when adverse drug reactions prevent completion of therapy with first line agents. Second line agents include quinolones, cycloserine, para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and anti-tuberculous aminoglycosides such as streptomycin or amikacin. Latent TB Infection (LTBI) Patients with LTBI are typically treated to decrease the risk of progression to active  15 15 \\ndisease. A single drug is adequate for treating LTBI due to the lower number of bacilli present. The most widely used treatments for LTBI are INH daily for 9 months or Rifampin daily for 4 months. Once weekly administration of INH and rifapentine (12 doses) is becoming more widely used and is as effective as 9 months of INH.RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH HIV Opportunistic respiratory infections are a major concern in patients with HIV.The Spectrum of Infection Patients with HIV are at risk for bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic pneumonias. The risk for particular infections within these categories can be predicted based on the patient\\'s CD4 cell count (Table 15-6). Table 15-6: Risk for Respiratory Infection as a Function of CD4 Count CD4 Cell Count Organism For Which Individual Is At Risk Bacterial pneumonia (S.Pneumoniae, Haemophilus), TB Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), cryptococcus neoformans, bacterial pneumonia with bacteremia or sepsis; extrapulmonary or disseminated TB Bacterial pneumonia due to pseudomonas aeruginosa; Toxoplasma gondii Coccidiomycosis, histoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, mycobacterium avium complex (increased risk of disseminated disease with each of these infections) Any < 200 cells/uL < 100 cells/ uL < 50 cells/ uL Adapted from: Huang L, Crothers K.HIV-associated opportunistic pneumonias. Respirology 2009. 14: 474. Of the potential infections, bacterial pneumonia remains the most common respiratory infection with an incidence greater than that seen in HIV-negative individuals. Patients with HIV can be infected with the same organisms that cause pneumonia in non-HIV patients, as well as species, specifically Pseudomonas aeruginosa, that don\\'t normally cause pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts. HIV and TB HIV infection impairs the immune response to TB infection, greatly increasing the risk of transition from latent to active TB.The inflammatory response to TB infection also activates HIV replication and augments HIV progression. Tuberculosis can occur at any point in HIV infection. When the HIV viral load is low and the CD4 count is preserved (>200), TB presents with the expected radiographic patterns seen in primary and reactivation TB.As the viral load increases and the CD4 count decreases, any radiographic presentation is possible and the risk of hematogenous dissemination increases. Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia (PJP) PJP occurs in patients with HIV when the CD4 cell counts falls below 200 cells/uL.Because the infection is not seen in immunocompetent individuals, the diagnosis of PJP in a person not previously known to be HIV-positive serves as the first indication that they are, in fact, infected with the virus. Patients classically have a 16  15 \\nsubacute presentation of fever, non-productive cough and dyspnea over a 3-4 week period. Most patients are very hypoxemic but only 50% have abnormal findings on lung exam. Chest radiographs show diffuse, bilateral opacities, while chest CT reveals ground glass opacities (Figure 15-12) and, in some cases, cystic lesions (hence the term \"pneumocystis\"). Cysts can rupture and cause pneumothorax. As a result, pneumothorax in a patient with HIV or a patient with clear HIV risk factors should always raise concern for PJP.Figure 15-12: Chest imaging in Pneumocystis Pneumonia. The plain chest radiograph on the left shows diffuse bilateral opacities while the chest CT on the right demonstrates bilateral hazy \"ground glass\" indicative of a process filling the alveolar spaces. to increase these the sensitivity of Diagnosis relies on identifying the organism on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage samples using either silver (GMS) or immunofluorescent staining. PCR can also be performed tests. Trimethoprim- Sulfamethoxazole is the first line treatment. Corticosteroids are added in patients with severe hypoxemia (PaO2 < 70 mm Hg or (A-a)O2Δ > 35 mm Hg) to counteract the inflammatory reaction that occurs with initiation of treatment. PEDIATRIC RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS Several major infections that affect children are considered below. Physiologic Differences in Children That Increase Risk of Complications Children have important physiologic differences compared to adults that limit pulmonary reserve and increase the risk of decompensation during respiratory infections. As described in Chapter 4, infants have a more compliant chest wall and more horizontal ribs compared to adults which decreases functional residual capacity and increases the risk of hypoxemia. Their diaphragm is also more horizontal and has fewer fatigue-resistant fibers, which decreases respiratory muscle endurance during stress. Finally, the peripheral airways are narrower than in adults and, as a result, any process that causes airway narrowing (e.g., bronchiolitis) markedly increases airways resistance. Bronchiolitis  15 17 \\nBronchiolitis refers to inflammation in the lower airways (bronchioles) and is generally used to describe first-time wheezing associated with a viral respiratory infection. The most common etiology is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), although other viruses also cause this entity. Peak age for hospitalization is 2-3 months of age, likely as a consequence of the narrow airway diameter and immaturity of the immune system in this age range. Affected children typically have upper respiratory symptoms (coryza and rhinorrhea) for several days before developing cough, wheezing, chest wall retractions and respiratory distress. Due to the increased work of breathing, they may stop feeding. Fever may or may not be present. Chest radiographs reveal air trapping, peribronchial thickening, subsegmental opacities, and rarely, lobar collapse. Treatment is supportive and includes supplemental oxygen, nasal suctioning, reducing anxiety, intravenous fluids to maintain adequate hydration, and antipyretic therapy. Antibiotics and mist therapy have not been shown to be of benefit. Temporary use of bronchodilators may improve wheezing and respiratory distress. Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup) Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB) is a syndrome of extra-thoracic upper airway obstruction. Often referred to as croup, LTB typically occurs due to viral infections producing subglottic edema, with the most common causes being Parainfluenza and RSV.Croup is most commonly seen in the winter months in children ages 6 months to 3 years. Affected children present with symptoms of upper respiratory infection for 2-3 days, followed by a barky cough, stridor and hoarseness. They often lack fever, do not appear toxic and, in contrast to children with epiglottitis, do not complain of significant sore throat or drooling. On exam, they may have increased inspiratory effort associated with stridor. In severe cases, intercostal retractions, cyanosis and mental status changes develop. Anteroposterior radiographs of the neck often reveal a \"steeple sign\" representing subglottic narrowing (Figure 15-13). Routine lab studies are generally not useful. Leukocytosis is uncommon and, when present, should raise concern for bacterial tracheitis or epiglottitis. Figure 15-13: Radiographic findings in croup. (A) Normal AP radiograph of the upper airway with normal subglottic region (arrows); (B) AP radiograph in a patient with croup demonstrating narrowing of the subglottic region (inverted V-appearance or Steeple sign). Source: Salour. Radiology 2000. 216: 428-429. For children with significant stridor and respiratory distress, aerosolized racemic (D-and L-) or L-epinephrine are used to reduce subglottic edema. Steroids reduce the need for hospitalization and shorten hospital stay. Epiglottitis 18  15 \\nEpiglottitis generally occurs in children between 1 and 5 years of age and is considered a medical emergency due to the high risk of sudden upper airway obstruction. H.Influenza type B (Hib) has historically been the primary cause, but Hib vaccination has markedly reduced the incidence of this infection. Stridor is common in epiglottitis and is distinguished from that seen in croup by its sudden onset and rapid progression. Other typical features include high fever, muffled (rather than hoarse) voice, dysphagia and drooling, refusal to eat, drink or sleep, a preference for sitting (often in the \"sniff position\") and anxiety. Diagnosis is made by the appearance of a thickened and bulging epiglottis (\"thumb\" sign) and thickened aryepiglottic folds on a lateral neck radiograph (Figure 15-14) and confirmed by direct observation of a swollen, red epiglottis and inflamed supraglottic structures. Such an examination should occur only in a well- staffed operating room including a competent surgeon and anesthesiologist. Figure 15-14: Radiographic findings in epiglottitis. Panel A: Normal epiglottis on lateral radiograph of the neck (black arrow). Panel B: Abnormally thickened epiglottis (white arrow) in a patient with epiglottis. Source: Grover. New Engl J Med 2011. 365: 447. Epiglottitis requires endotracheal intubation and antibiotics, generally for 48-72 hours. The outcome for those who undergo intubation prior to developing significant hypoxemia is excellent.  15 19 \\n 20  15 \\nChapter 16 Acute Respiratory Failure INTRODUCTION Regardless of the field in which you ultimately choose to practice, you are likely to encounter patients with severe respiratory compromise. The goal of this chapter is to outline a clinical approach to such patients that draws on physiologic principles covered earlier in the course. At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Describe a diagnostic approach to patients presenting with acute respiratory failure and link that approach to basic physiologic principles. Develop a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with ventilatory failure or isolated hypoxemic respiratory failure. Describe the basic management strategies for patients presenting with ventilatory failure or hypoxemic respiratory failure. Explain the risk factors, clinical features and management of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) WHAT IS ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE Although there is no officially accepted definition, acute respiratory failure (ARF) generally refers to a situation in which the patient cannot maintain adequate oxygenation and/or ventilation. This can be due to impaired gas exchange or the inability to perform the required work of breathing. The key features of this entity include the acuity of onset and the severity of the observed abnormalities. In some cases, patients have ostensibly normal PaO2 and PaCO2 but are working hard to maintain those values and are at risk for decompensation should they fail to sustain that effort. ARF is not a disease itself, but, instead, is a physiologically defined situation resulting from a variety of diseases with a variety of presentations. You must be prepared for this variability when assessing patients with acute respiratory issues. WHAT CONSTITUTES \"ACUTE\" When the term \"acute\" is applied to respiratory failure, it implies that the symptoms and signs have developed within minutes to hours to up to a few days. Pulmonary embolism can cause symptoms of respiratory failure within minutes, for example, whereas pneumonia may, in some cases, progress to overt respiratory failure over 1-2 days. This timing is in contrast to chronic respiratory failure, as seen in advanced COPD or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in which respiratory failure develops over a period of months to years. One implication of the difference in timing between acute and chronic respiratory failure is the fact that acute processes allow little time for compensation and adaptation, which may occur in more chronic processes. Patients with chronic forms of respiratory failure may have acute periods of worsening of their symptoms, as is the case in COPD exacerbations, for example. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"acute on chronic respiratory failure.\"  16 1 \\nA DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE Given the heterogeneity of acute respiratory failure, it is useful to have a diagnostic framework for this condition. The framework presented below is based on the same principles for determining the cause of hypoxemia in a given patient discussed in Chapter 6. In considering this framework, we will assume the patient is breathing air (FIO2 0.21) as this makes it easier to sort through these concepts. Recognize that in clinical practice, patients are often on varying amounts of oxygen as you evaluate them, which makes interpreting the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference ([A-a]ΔO2) difficult. The first step in identifying the cause of respiratory failure is an arterial blood gas. Once the blood gas is obtained, a step-wise approach is used to sort through the problem (Figure 16-1). This involves asking several questions. Figure 16-1: A Framework for Evaluating the Cause of Respiratory Failure Question 1: Does the patient have hypercarbia? The presence of hypercarbia (PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg) tells us that the patient has ventilatory failure. Ventilatory failure may be the primary problem (e.g., Guillain Barre syndrome or myasthenia gravis crisis) or may occur secondary to another process (e.g., progressive respiratory muscle fatigue due to high work of breathing in the setting of a severe pneumonia). More information on determining the cause of this issue is described later in this chapter. 2  16 \\n Question 2: What is the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference ([A-a]DO2)? The (A-a)DO2 can be used in conjunction with the PaCO2 to identify the cause of the patient\\'s hypoxemia: Elevated PaCO2, Normal (A-a)DO2: All of the hypoxemia can be attributed to hypoventilation and the patient has isolated ventilatory failure. Elevated PaCO2, Elevated (A-a)DO2: Hypoventilation is one cause of hypoxemia but shunt and/or low VA/Q are also playing a role. Normal PaCO2, Elevated (A-a)DO2: Hypoxemia is due to shunt and/or low VA/Q alone and there is no element of ventilatory failure. Question 3: What is the response to supplemental oxygen? Once you have identified that the hypoxemia is due to either low VA/Q or shunt, the response to supplemental oxygen helps determine which of those factors is playing the primary role. Hypoxemia due to low VA/Q responds readily to supplemental oxygen (e.g., the patient with a COPD exacerbation) while hypoxemia due to shunt can be quite refractory to supplemental oxygen depending on the shunt fraction (e.g., severe pneumonia). In reality, most patients have a mixture of low VA/Q and shunt. SORTING THROUGH THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Once you have answered the questions above, you can sort through the differential diagnosis. Ventilatory Failure For patients with an element of ventilatory failure (i.e., PaCO2 > 45 mm Hg), there are several ways to conceptualize the differential diagnosis. One way is to use the framework described in Chapter 3 for evaluating why the PaCO2 may deviate from the normal range. You will recall that the PaCO2 is determined by the balance between how much CO2 is produced and delivered to the alveolus and how much is eliminated through alveolar ventilation: P!CO\"=VCO\"V#\\t \\t\\t V#\\t=\\tV%\\t\\t-\\tV&,()*+,-.-/,0 Anything that raises CO2 production and/or decreases alveolar ventilation will cause the PaCO2 to rise. If it is deemed that the alveolar ventilation is insufficient, you then consider the factors that affect alveolar ventilation - dead space ventilation and minute ventilation - and determine which of these is abnormal: Another way to conceptualize the problem of ventilatory failure is to view the patient\\'s ability to maintain adequate minute ventilation and alveolar ventilation as a balance between the demands placed on the respiratory system (the \"load\") versus the patient\\'s \"ability\" to meet those demands. In some cases, patients have adequate respiratory system function but face too great a demand  16 3 \\nIncreased airway resistance on their respiratory system. There are three categories of problems that lead to excessive loads (Table 16-1):   Decreased respiratory system compliance Increased minute ventilation requirements (high dead space or high CO2 production) Increased Airways Table 16-1: Causes of Increased \"Load\" on the Respiratory System Increased Minute Ventilation Needs High dead space Decreased Compliance Pulmonary edema Resistance Asthma exacerbation COPD exacerbation Bronchospasm Airway secretions Airway foreign body ARDS Pleural effusions Pneumothorax Chest wall edema Fever Sepsis Metabolic acidosis Hyperthyroidism In other cases, the demands are within a normal range but the patient lacks the capacity to do this work (Table 16-2). This may be due to abnormal respiratory drive, a nervous system issue or a muscle problem limiting their strength. Table 16-2: Causes of Decreased \"Ability\" to Maintain Work of Breathing Respiratory Drive Muscle Problem CVA Encephalopathy * Neurologic Problem Guillain Barre Syndrome ALS Myasthenia Gravis Botulism Diaphragmatic paralysis Muscular dystrophy Myopathy Cervical spinal cord injury ALS: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; CVA: cerebrovascular accident * Encephalopathy may be toxic (e.g., substance ingestion) or due to metabolic derangements Hypoxemia The number of disorders that cause hypoxemia is large. When patients primarily have problems with low VA/Q, you should consider problems such as exacerbations of asthma, COPD or cystic fibrosis or some other process causing airflow obstruction. When patients primarily have shunt, there is typically a process that fills or compresses the alveoli (e.g., atelectasis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage) or some form of abnormal communication between the right and left side of the circulation such as an intrapulmonary arteriovenous malformation or an intracardiac right-to-left shunt. Pulmonary embolism can also cause hypoxemia by causing redistribution of blood flow and alterations in the ventilation-perfusion ratios, a concept covered in Chapter 13 and Conference 7. EVALUATING THE PATIENT IN RESPIRATORY FAILURE The evaluation of patients with respiratory failure begins with a focused history and physical examination. Common symptoms and signs of acute respiratory  16 4 \\nfailure are listed in Table 16-3. As you conduct this assessment, remember that the manifestations vary between patients based on the acuity and etiology of their problem. In particular, when patients present with worsening hypercarbia, rather than showing signs of respiratory distress, such as accessory muscle use, they may simply be somnolent and difficult to arouse, as increased PaCO2 can cause altered mental status, a phenomenon referred to as CO2 narcosis. Table 16-3: Clinical Manifestations of Acute Respiratory Failure Signs Cyanosis Tachycardia Arrhythmia Diaphoresis Hyper- or hypotension Lethargy, somnolence, coma Accessory muscle use Paradoxical abdominal motion Symptoms Dyspnea Restlessness Chest tightness Chest pain Confusion Agitation Headache Tremor One goal of the bedside assessment is to identify where the pathology lies in the respiratory system. The upper airway, in particular, requires close attention, as signs of upper airway obstruction seen in processes like angioedema or epiglottitis dramatically change management. Common signs of upper airway compromise include stridor, suprasternal and supraclavicular retractions, drooling, inability to handle secretions, muffled speech and choking. The standard initial work-up for acute respiratory failure includes pulse oximetry, plain chest radiography and an arterial blood gas. Electrocardiography should be considered when you suspect a cardiac etiology while basic laboratory studies (complete blood count, chemistry panel, toxicology screens, urinalysis) are also used in certain cases. Elevations in B-type natriuretic peptide suggest a cardiac rather than pulmonary etiology for the patient\\'s dyspnea. Additional testing, such as chest CT scanning, may be done based on the initial assessment (e.g., high suspicion for pulmonary embolism). Note that pulmonary function testing is not part of the work-up for acute respiratory failure. MANAGEMENT ACUTE RESPIRATORY FAILURE There are three components to managing a patient with acute respiratory failure. Address the Underlying Cause Treatment should be directed at the underlying problem such as antibiotics for pneumonia or inotropes and diuretics for acute decompensated heart failure. In severe cases, the management steps described below, such as invasive mechanical ventilation, often must be started before the diagnostic work-up is completed and you know what disease-specific therapies to start. Less severe presentations, however, afford time to pursue a diagnostic work-up before treatment or supportive measures are initiated.  16 5 \\nin which ventilatory failure framework outlined above Address Ventilatory Failure When patients have ventilatory failure based on the fact that the PaCO2 is increased, a key component of management is some effort to assist the patient\\'s ventilatory efforts. The appropriate intervention can be identified using the conceptual is conceptualized as the balance between the demands placed on the patient (\"the load\") and their ability to meet those demands. \"Load\" Problems (Table 16-1): Therapy might include, for example, aggressive bronchodilation and intravenous steroids to decrease airway resistance in an asthma exacerbation or aggressive diuresis to improve pulmonary edema and lung compliance. \"Ability\" Problems (Table 16-2): Therapy might include efforts to improve respiratory drive (e.g., administering naloxone to a patient with a heroin overdose) or mechanical ventilation to support a patient with neuromuscular incompetence or evolving respiratory muscle fatigue. Be aware that multiple strategies are often pursued simultaneously in support of patients with ventilatory failure. For example, patients with severe COPD exacerbations may require non-invasive ventilation to unload their respiratory muscles while you wait for the bronchodilators and steroids to improve airway resistance and air-trapping. Similarly, patients with acute pulmonary edema, may require invasive mechanical ventilation while diuresis proceeds and compliance improves to the point that they can support their own work of breathing. Mechanical ventilation can be provided by one of two means: Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV): ventilatory support is delivered through a tight-fitting mask. When the machine detects that the patient is trying to inhale, the machine raises the pressure at the mouth. This increases the pressure gradient between the mouth and the alveolus promoting more inspiratory flow and assisting the patient\\'s respiratory muscles. To better understand how this works, imagine you are breathing in and out of a straw and that each time you inhale, someone walks up to the other end of the straw and blows on it to inflate your lungs. Their effort assists your effort. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation: an endotracheal tube is inserted via the mouth into the patient\\'s airway and positive pressure is used to deliver breaths to the patient. The physiologic principles underlying this form of ventilatory support are described in Chapter 4. There are actually many methods (referred to as \"modes of mechanical ventilation\") for delivering this support but they are beyond the scope of this course. Invasive mechanical ventilatory support is used in patients with contraindications to non-invasive ventilation or with severe respiratory failure that is unlikely to respond to non-invasive support or anticipated to require a prolonged duration of therapy Note that when patients have acute respiratory failure due to upper airway obstruction, the highest priority is to establish and maintain a patient airway. This typically involves intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation but may, in some cases, require an emergent surgical airway (cricothyrotomy with placement of a tracheotomy tube). 6  16 \\nManaging Hypoxemia The cornerstone of managing hypoxemia is administration of supplemental oxygen and other steps to raise the PaO2. There are different ways to administer oxygen depending on whether the patient is breathing spontaneously or receiving mechanical ventilation. Spontaneously Breathing Patients In spontaneously breathing patients, supplemental oxygen can be delivered via nasal prongs (often called nasal cannula) or a facemask. These systems do not force air down into the lungs. Instead, they create a reservoir of oxygen-enriched air in the posterior naso- and oropharynx or in front of the face and when the individual inhales, they draw in oxygen-enriched air from this reservoir. With the most commonly used systems, the FIO2 varies from patient to patient due to the fact that the flow of oxygen-enriched air to the patient may be low relative to their minute ventilation and/or inspiratory flow rate. When patients have high minute ventilation and/or a high inspiratory flow rate they inhale a lot of ambient air in addition to the oxygen delivered through the device. This has the effect of decreasing the FIO2 of the inspired gas. A solution to this problem is what are called \"high-flow\" delivery systems. Using special airflow generators, very high flows of oxygen (30-50 L/min) are delivered to the patient. Regardless of how high the minute ventilation or inspiratory flow rate, little ambient air is entrained into airways. This avoids the dilution effect seen with the low flow systems and allows delivery of a consistent FIO2 that can be as high as 1.0 if needed. Mechanically Ventilated Patients When patients are intubated and receiving invasive mechanical ventilatory support, two strategies are used to improve the PaO2. Increase the FIO2: The FIO2 can be adjusted to any level between 0.21 and 1.0. The response to this intervention varies depending on whether the patient has predominantly low VA/Q or shunt and, in the event of shunt, the magnitude of the shunt fraction (described in Chapter 6). (PEEP): During exhalation, alveolar Positive End-Expiratory Pressure pressure normally falls to zero cm H2O.As a result, the transmural pressure across the wall of the alveoli at the end of exhalation is low and the alveoli have a very low volume or may even collapse (atelectasis). This worsens ventilation- perfusion matching and impairs gas exchange. PEEP refers to the application of positive pressure to the airways and alveoli during the expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle (Figure 16-2). This has the effect of increasing the transmural pressure of the alveolus, thereby bringing it to a higher volume and preventing atelectasis (Figure 16-3). The net effect of this change is to preserve ventilation of the alveoli, thereby maintaining an adequate ventilation-perfusion ratio and, in turn, efficient gas exchange. PEEP has a greater effect on oxygenation when used in diffuse rather than focal processes. The change in PaO2 with PEEP varies between patients based on factors that are beyond the scope of this course. While PEEP carries benefits, it  16 7 \\ndoes increase the risk of barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum) and can have adverse hemodynamic consequences. The latter risk stems from the fact that PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure and, as a result, may decrease venous return and cardiac output. As a result, even though the PaO2 may increase on high PEEP, overall oxygen delivery to the tissues may go down if cardiac output decreases significantly. Figure 16-2: Airway Pressure without (A) and with (B) Application of Positive End Expiratory Pressure During Mechanical Ventilation Figure 16-3: PEEP and Alveolar Volume. Panel A: No PEEP.Alveolar pressure at end-exhalation is zero. Transmural pressure and, therefore alveolar volume are low. Panel B: PEEP = 10 cm H2O.This leads to a higher transmural pressure and, therefore, a higher alveolar volume. Note, because some of the PEEP is transmitted to the pleural space, pleural pressure is not equal between the two situations. ARDS: AN IMPORTANT CAUSE OF SEVERE HYPOXEMIA Consider the following case: A 45 year-old man presents with fever and cough over two days. After chest radiography reveals a right lower lobe opacity, he is given oxygen and antibiotics for pneumonia. Six hours later, he develops worsening dyspnea and his SpO2 falls to 82% on high flow facemask (FIO2 of 0.8). A repeat chest radiograph (Figure 16-4) reveals diffuse bilateral opacities. He is placed on mechanical ventilation and requires an FIO2 of 1.0 and a PEEP of 15 cm H2O to maintain adequate oxygenation. 8  16 \\nThis patient presented with community-acquired pneumonia but progressed to a severe form of respiratory failure, often associated with severe hypoxemia, referred to as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Figure 16-4: Portable chest radiograph in ARDS demonstrating diffuse bilateral opacities. Definition ARDS is a clinical syndrome marked by the presence of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema (i.e., pulmonary edema with normal cardiac function), lung inflammation, decreased lung compliance and severe hypoxemia. The syndrome does not occur without provocation and, instead, typically follows serious injury or illness that may or may not initially involve the respiratory system. It can develop from a few hours to 7 days after the patient\\'s initial insult and may take weeks to resolve. ARDS is diagnosed when patients meet the following criteria: Acute: onset within 7 days of known insult Impaired oxygenation defined as a ratio of the PaO2 / FIO2 (P/F) < 300 Chest radiograph with bilateral opacities not explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse or nodules (Figure 16-4) Respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. Risk Factors ARDS has a precipitating cause. Conditions/illnesses associated with the development of ARDS can be divided between those associated with direct injury to the lung and those associated with indirect injury (Table 16-4). Table 16-4: Risk Factors for the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome in cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which develops due Pathophysiology Unlike increased hydrostatic pressures, edema formation in ARDS is due to the increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier. The precise mechanism is unknown 9  16 Direct Injury Pneumonia (bacterial or viral) Aspiration Pulmonary contusion Toxic inhalation Near-drowning Indirect Injury Sepsis Major trauma Pancreatitis Burns Multiple blood transfusions \\nalthough inflammation is thought to play a large role. Surfactant activity is also diminished through a combination of decreased production and inactivation of preexisting surfactant. Three physiologic problems occur in ARDS: (1) accumulation of edema fluid in alveoli causes right-to-left shunt; (2) increased dead space due an overall increase in ventilation-perfusion heterogeneity; (3) decreased compliance due to the combination of edema and atelectasis from the loss of surfactant function. Together, these processes increase the work of breathing and severely impair oxygenation. Pathology The lungs in ARDS are heavy, diffusely consolidated and often show areas of hemorrhage. On histopathology, three overlapping stages can be seen, although not every patient progresses through all three phases. Exudative Phase: Lasting the first 5-7 days, this phase is marked by the presence of \"diffuse alveolar damage,\" in which there is edema fluid in the alveoli, hyaline membrane formation, focal hemorrhage and areas of neutrophil and macrophage infiltration (Figure 16-5). Proliferative Phase: Neutrophil counts and edema in the alveoli decrease, reorganize. is obliterated and hyaline membranes microvasculature Fibroblast activity increases causing collagen deposition. Fibrotic Phase: A small subset of patients develops a fibrotic process lasting several weeks after the initial injury. Figure 16-5: Histopathology of diffuse alveolar damage. The red areas are red blood cells indicative of hemorrhage (dotted arrows) while the pink hyaline areas membrane (solid arrows). represent formation Clinical Manifestations and Chest Imaging ARDS typically manifests with symptoms and signs of severe respiratory failure. In the majority of cases, the presentation is severe enough to warrant invasive mechanical ventilation. Non-invasive modalities are rarely useful in these patients. A hallmark of ARDS is severe hypoxemia. Because shunt is the predominant cause of this problem, these patients are typically refractory to increases in the FIO2. Another key clinical feature is the decrease in lung compliance. This initially manifests as increased work of breathing and, once the patient is on the ventilator, as a need for higher distending pressures. 10  16 \\nBy definition, the plain chest radiograph in ARDS is marked by the presence of diffuse bilateral opacities (Figure 16-4). CT scanning is not routinely done to make the diagnosis but when performed reveals patchy areas of ground glass opacities and/or dense consolidation, often in the dependent lung regions. Treatment There are three components to ARDS treatment: Support oxygenation Increased PEEP is commonly used when patients do not respond to increased FIO2. When PEEP and increased FIO2 are not sufficient to maintain oxygenation, several \"rescue\" strategies beyond the scope of this course are used. Lung protective ventilation ARDS patients are placed on lower tidal volumes than usual with the initial targeted tidal volume being 6 mL/kg of the predicted body weight. The goal is to prevent over-distention of alveoli, which contributes to ongoing lung injury. Good supportive care Those who die from ARDS rarely die due to hypoxemia, and instead die from their original illness or the other bad things that happen to ICU patients (e.g., pneumonia, venous thromboembolism [VTE]). As a result, a premium is placed on high quality supportive care to prevent iatrogenic complications, including VTE and stress ulcer prophylaxis, good skin care and many other strategies. Outcomes With improvements in supportive care and the advent of lung protective ventilation (tidal volume of < 6 mL/kg), mortality has been reduced to about 25- 30%. Interestingly, although hypoxemia is a key feature of the disease, the severity of hypoxemia is not necessarily indicative of a poor outcome. Mortality varies, however, based on the precipitating cause with worse outcomes seen in those patients with sepsis and multiorgan failure and better outcomes seen in major trauma. Recent studies indicate that mortality is higher in African American and Hispanic patients. While genetic and epigenetic phenomena may play a role, these disparities more likely result from delays in receiving healthcare due to socioeconomic factors and increased severity of illness at presentation. Despite what can sometimes be very severe lung injury, most patients who survive ARDS have near normal pulmonary testing and chest radiographs 6-12 months following their illness. Many patients, however, experience severe neuromuscular weakness following their illness and report functional limitations and decreased health-related quality of life for up to several years. Depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment have also been described in ARDS survivors. OTHER FORMS OF SEVERE LUNG INJURY Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) Discussed in Chapter 4, neonatal RDS develops due to deficiency of surfactant, most commonly as a consequence of premature birth. Loss of surfactant leads to  16 11 function \\na marked decrease in lung compliance due to increased surface tension with subsequent development of atelectasis and severe hypoxemia. On histopathologic exam, the primary findings are hyaline membranes, similar to those seen in ARDS (Figure 16-6). When pre-term delivery is necessary due to pregnancy complications, the lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio in amniotic fluid can be used to assess for lung maturity (< 1.5 predicts development of RDS). Corticosteroid administration to the mother around the time of delivery is used to stimulate surfactant production and prevent RDS.After birth, RDS presents with grunting, nasal flaring, intercostal retractions and hypoxemia. Treatment involves administration of exogenous surfactant and good supportive care, including supplemental oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and possibly invasive mechanical ventilation. Neonates who levels of supplemental oxygen are at risk for retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. require high Figure 16-6: Histopathology of neonatal respiratory distress. The primary findings on histopathologic exam is the presence of hyaline membranes, the pink material indicated by the black arrows. Electronic Cigarette / Vaping Product Use-Associated Lung Injury (E-VALI) In 2019, the first descriptions appeared in public health reports and subsequently the medical literature of individuals who were developing lung disease due to use of electronic cigarettes or vaping products. The etiology of the problem, which ranges in severity from mild respiratory illness to full blown ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, is unclear. It has been seen with a range of devices and liquids and could relate to some of the flavorants, volatile organic compounds or heavy metals associated with some of the myriad of products on both the legal and black market. Corticosteroids have been used to treat E-VALI in some cases but given the relatively small number of cases, controlled studies have yet to be performed to determine whether any other therapies beyond lung protective ventilation for ARDS are beneficial. COVID-19 Although SARS-CoV-2 infection manifests in a myriad of ways, the primary source of morbidity and mortality has been respiratory failure secondary to viral pneumonia. The severity of illness varies significantly between patients, ranging from hypoxemia that can be supported by oxygen by nasal cannula alone to very severe ARDS requiring not only invasive mechanical ventilation but also complicated interventions, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Plain chest radiography typically demonstrates patchy bilateral alveolar opacities while Chest CT scans demonstrate varying degrees of ground glass opacities (Figure 16-7). Early in the pandemic, questions were raised about 12  16 \\nwhether ARDS due to COVID-19 differed from that due to other inciting factors and, as a resulted, warranted different management approaches. Multiple, carefully controlled studies have demonstrated, however, that the alterations in gas exchange, compliance, deadspace fraction and other parameters are similar to those seen in ARDS from other causes. As a result, aside from the use of medications not typically given in other forms of ARDS - remdesivir and dexamethasone - the management principles remains the same as for other forms of ARDS described above. Figure 16-7: Imaging in COVID-19. Panel A: Plain chest radiograph showing patchy bilateral alveolar opacities. Panel B: Single slice from a CT scan from a different patient showing extensive bilateral ground glass opacities. Inhalation Injury The term \"inhalation injury\" refers to damage to the airways or lung parenchyma as a result of heat, smoke or chemical irritants brought into the airways during inhalation. Three general problems may develop in these situations: Tracheobronchial Injury Thermal and/or chemical injury leads to airway erythema, ulcerations and edema. This impairs ciliary function and airway clearance, increases production of airway secretions and, as a result, predisposes to infection. Parenchymal Injury Injury and clinical manifestations (low compliance, hypoxemia) similar to that seen in ARDS can develop if inhaled smoke or chemicals reach the alveolar space. Systemic Toxicity Inhalation of toxic substances can lead to carbon monoxide and/or cyanide toxicity depending on the composition of the material that burned in the fire.  16 13 \\n 14  16 \\nCardiovascular Pulmonary Renal Conference Materials Winter 2021 University of Washington School of Medicine \\n \\nPulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology CPR 2021 Conference Materials Conference Title Scheduled Session 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 How We Handle Oxygen How We Handle Carbon Dioxide and Move Air Why Is This Patient Hypoxemic Why Is This Patient Breathing Irregularly Why Is This Patient Obstructed Why Is This Patient Restricted Pulmonary Vascular Diseases Why Is This Patient Febrile and Coughing Day 18 Hours 3 and 4 Day 19 Hours 3 and 4 Day 20 Hours 3 and 4 Day 21 Hours 3 and 4 Day 22 Hours 3 and 4 Day 24 Hours 3 and 4 Day 25 Hours 3 and 4 Day 26 Hours 3 and 4 \\n \\nConference 1: How We Handle Oxygen CPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Day: 18 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 Prior to the start of medical school, a 30 year-old woman who resides at sea level, travels to Alaska as part of a climbing expedition on Denali. Her team flies from the town of Talkeetna to base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier (elevation: 7,500 ft) and travels over a period of one week to the advanced base camp at 14,000 feet in elevation. They will remain there until weather and terrain conditions permit an attempt to move up to high camp at 17,000 ft and eventually try for the summit (20,322 ft). 1. Compared to sea level, what changes would you expect to see in the following parameters following arrival at advanced base camp? Focus on general trends only. FIO2: PIO2: PAO2: PaO2: SaO2: Assuming a barometric pressure of 480 mm Hg at advanced base camp and a PaCO2 of 32 mm Hg, what is the average PAO2 throughout the lung? 2. In the blank figure on the next page, draw a figure demonstrating how the PO2 changes as blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries in an individual at rest at sea level. How will this relationship change when she is at advanced base camp? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) Sea Level High Altitude 3. While lying in her tent on the first day at advanced base camp, she notices that her resting heart rate was 90 beats/minute, far higher than the resting heart rate she typically recorded at home following her 6-month period of training for the climb. What is the mechanism for the observed change and what are the physiologic implications of this change? 2 (Continued on Next Page) CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\n Case 1 (continued) 4. Due to the severe weather systems that delayed plans to go higher on the mountain, the team spends a total of 17 days at or above advanced base camp before successfully reaching the summit. If you were to measure her arterial oxygen content at advanced base camp as the team is preparing to finally head down the mountain, how would this value compare to her arterial oxygen content when she first arrived at advanced base camp two weeks earlier? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 3 \\n4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\nCase 2 A 42 year-old man is admitted to the ICU with bleeding from a gastric ulcer. At the time of admission, his vital signs are: blood pressure 80/42 mm Hg, heart rate 130 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation 98% breathing ambient air. The initial labs drawn in the Emergency Department prior to transfer to the ICU reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL.This is decreased from the value seen on a lab check during an annual health evaluation one week ago (14 g/dL). 1. In the blank figure below, draw the relationship between the hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2) and note the typical arterial and venous values for a healthy individual residing at sea level? 2. What are the implications of the shape of this relationship when red blood cells travel through the pulmonary capillaries? What are the implications when the red cells travel through the capillaries in the peripheral tissues? 5 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\nCase 2 (continued) 3. What effect will his gastrointestinal bleeding have on the relationship diagrammed in Question 1? What effect will it have on oxygen content? 4. What can you do to improve oxygen delivery to his tissues? Which of these interventions would have the biggest impact? 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\nCase 3 A healthy 22 year-old woman completes a cardiopulmonary exercise test as part of her training program for the University of Washington rowing team. For the test, she is placed on a bicycle ergometer and asked to pedal against steadily increasing levels of resistance until she cannot turn the pedals any more. As she performs this physical work, various parameters are measured that provide a comprehensive assessment of her maximum exercise capacity, cardiac function and ventilatory function. 1) By sampling expired gas, we are able to derive an estimate of her PAO2 throughout the test. A diagram of the changes in this parameter as she performs steadily increasing levels of work is shown below. How do you account for the patterns observed in the time periods A and B? 2) The figure below shows the changes in arterial and mixed venous oxygen content over the course of the exercise test. How do you account for the observed changes in mixed venous oxygen content? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 7 \\n8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\nCase 4 During a spell of very cold weather, a 13 year-old boy is brought into the emergency department by his parents with obtundation. According to his mother, the electricity in their apartment had been off for two days following a severe wind storm and the family had been trying various things to warm their house, including bringing their charcoal grill into the living room. Upon arrival, he is normotensive with a heart rate of 135, respiratory rate of 24. On exam, she is taking deep breaths at an increased rate. He has vesicular breath sounds without crackles or wheezes. His cardiac exam reveals a rapid rate but no murmur. His abdomen is soft and non- tender and his skin shows no rashes or cyanosis. An arterial blood gas is drawn while he is breathing ambient air and reveals the following: pH 7.20 PaCO2 25 PaO2 110 - HCO3 10 On his other labs, her hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL (normal 13-15 g/dL), while his serum lactate is 15 mEq/L (normal < 2 mEq/L). An echocardiogram is performed and reveals normal left ventricular size, diastolic filling and systolic function. His chest radiograph shows no focal opacities or effusions. 1. Why does he have a severe lactic acidosis despite the fact that his PaO2 is normal and the echocardiogram demonstrates normal left ventricular function? What clinical condition could explain this picture? 2. How will arterial oxygen content change in this situation? What happens to hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen? 3. As you are writing PICU admission orders, the attending physician in the Emergency Department asks you if you would like to send the patient to Virginia Mason Medical Center for treatment in that facility\\'s hyperbaric chamber. How might this help the patient from a physiologic standpoint? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 9 \\n 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 \\nCPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 2: How We Handle CO2 And Move Air Day: 19 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 26 year-old man develops progressive shortness of breath over four days with associated fever and chills. He finally decides to see a doctor and presents to the Emergency Department. His initial exam reveals a young man in moderate respiratory distress with heart rate 112 beats/minute, blood pressure 98/56 mm Hg and respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute. The triage nurse checks pulse oximetry and finds his hemoglobin-oxygen saturation (SpO2) to be 82%. She also obtains an arterial blood gas sample with the following results: Parameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 53 mm Hg 38 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg She places him on supplemental oxygen to try to normalize his SpO2. Despite this therapy, the patient appears more and more fatigued. The physician evaluating him in the ED decides he should be intubated and supported on invasive mechanical ventilation. He asks the respiratory therapist to set up the ventilator with the following settings: Parameter FIO2 Tidal volume (VT) Respiratory rate (f) Setting 1.0 1000 mL 10 breaths / minute 1. What is the patient\\'s minute ventilation (V  E) while on mechanical ventilation? A repeat arterial blood gas is performed while he is on these ventilator settings and reveals: Parameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 125 mm Hg 58 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg 2. Why has the patient\\'s PaCO2 risen? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 1 \\nParameter FIO2 Tidal volume (VT) Respiratory rate (f) Setting 0.9 500 mL 20 breaths / minute A repeat arterial blood gas reveals: Parameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 85 mm Hg 69 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg 3. What is the patient\\'s minute ventilation now? Why has the PaCO2 increased further compared to when he was on the prior ventilator settings? 4. What could be done to lower the PaCO2? Over the following five days, he receives antibiotics and supportive care for his pneumonia and related respiratory failure. Because he has a difficult time tolerating the ventilator, he is given relatively large doses of opiates and benzodiazepines to keep him sedated. He is no longer breathing at a rate above the one set on the ventilator. He has been immobile much of the time because his oxygenation acutely worsens whenever he is moved. He is afebrile and his blood pressure has remained stable, but his heart rate is increased. On the morning of the sixth day in the ICU, the nurse sends an arterial blood gas and becomes concerned when the results are compared to the prior values. Last Night\\'s Value This Morning\\'s Value Parameter PaO2 (mm Hg) PaCO2 (mm Hg) 65 60 60 75 The ventilator settings have not changed between the two arterial blood gases. 5. What are possible explanations for why the patient\\'s PaCO2 has changed? Case 1 (continued) The patient is transferred up to the ICU.The critical care physician caring for him is concerned that the patient\\'s tidal volumes are too high so she adjusts the ventilator. The new settings are: 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 \\nCase 2 A 37 year-old woman with asthma comes to clinic for a routine follow-up clinic appointment. She is feeling well at this time and has no complaints. On exam she appears well and the breath sounds that you hear are consistent with normal air movement into and out of the lung. You note that the abdomen moves outward during inspiration with expansion of the chest. Exhalation of air appears relaxed and passive without active contraction of any respiratory muscles. 1. Using the blank set of figures below, graph the changes pleural pressure, alveolar pressure, airflow and lung volume during inhalation and exhalation. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 3 \\nCase 2 (Continued) The patient returns to clinic two weeks later complaining of increasing dyspnea, chest tightness and wheezing over a several day period. On exam you now note an elevated pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate. On lung exam, you note that she is working harder to breathe than on his prior clinic visit. You appreciate that her expiratory phase is prolonged and hear polyphonic musical sounds consistent with wheezing. You also note strong contraction of the rectus abdominis muscles during exhalation. 2. Why are her rectus abdominus muscle contracting on exhalation? 4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 \\nCase 3 A 27 year-old man is involved in motorcycle collision and is intubated by the paramedics prior to transport to the hospital. Following a work-up in the Emergency Department, he is transported to the ICU for ongoing management and remains on the ventilator for several days. 1. In general terms, how does atmospheric air get into and out of the lungs while a patient is receiving mechanical ventilation? The ventilator is set to deliver a tidal volume of 600 mL.It is also set such that at the end of exhalation the pressure in the airway is 5 cm H2O rather than falling to 0 cm H2O.This is referred to as Positive End-Expiratory Pressure or PEEP.A curve demonstrating the airway pressure changes over time during mechanical ventilation is shown in the figure below. 2. The highest point reached during each inhalation is referred to as the Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP). What factors determine how high this value will be with each breath? The respiratory therapist performs an \"inspiratory pause\" maneuver. The tidal volume is delivered to the patient and, once the air has entered the system the system is paused and exhalation is prevented for 2 seconds. The pressure measured during this pause is called the \"static\" or \"plateau\" pressure. This is depicted in the figure on the next page. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 5 \\nCase 3 (continued) 3. What information does the pressure measured during the inspiratory pause tell us? Several hours later the respiratory therapist notices that the peak inspiratory pressure has increased from 40-45 cm H2O.To determine why this occurred, she performs another inspiratory pause maneuver and compares the static pressure to the one obtained earlier (See figure below). The patient was receiving 600 mL/breath during each of these maneuvers. 6 (Continued on Next Page) CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 \\nCase 3 (continued) 4. Describe the observed change in the graphical waveforms from the ventilator. What factors could account for such a change? 5. If you were to consider the compliance of this patient\\'s respiratory system when he was in a healthy state prior to the motorcycle collision, how would it compare to that seen in people at the extremes of age (i.e., infants and the elderly)? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 7 \\n8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 \\nCase 4 A 47 year-old woman is admitted to the hospital after presenting with progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness over a period of two weeks. Her symptoms initially started in her lower legs but have since progressed to the point that she is having trouble rising from a seated position. She has no underlying medical problems and has otherwise been well except for a short diarrheal illness following a trip to Mexico. She denies recent trauma and her evaluation in the Emergency Department revealed no evidence of vertebral injury or a spinal cord lesion. On exam, she was noted to have decreased strength and absent deep tendon reflexes in her bilateral lower extremities but her sensation was intact. Following admission, the hospitalist caring for the patient asked the respiratory therapist to conduct a few tests at the bedside. The respiratory therapist performed a test called spirometry during which she asked the patient to inhale to a maximal extent and then exhale as forcefully as she could until her lungs felt empty. The volume of air exhaled in this maneuver - referred to as the vital capacity - was only 43% of what you would expect for a woman of her age and height. The respiratory therapist then had the patient take a maximum inhalation against a closed valve to assess her maximum inspiratory pressure. She then repeated the same maneuver with a forced exhalation against a closed valve to measure her maximum expiratory pressure. Both of these values were reduced to less than 40% of what you would predict for someone of her age and height. 1. What changes would you expect to see in her PaCO2? How will these observed changes affect the CO2 content of her arterial blood? 2. Using the blank figure below, compare the content curves for oxygen and carbon dioxide in healthy individuals. What is the physiologic significance of the differences between these two curves? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 9 \\nCase 4 (continued) 3. How will this patient\\'s clinical situation affect the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve? 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 \\nCPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 3: Why Is This Patient Hypoxemic Day: 20 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A new method for measuring partial pressures of arterial gases is being developed. Normal subjects are enrolled in the study and asked to alter their alveolar ventilation to change their arterial gas composition. If blood flow (Q) remains the same and O2 removal from and CO2 delivery to the alveolus are constant, what will happen to the PAO2 and PACO2 as alveolar ventilation increases and decreases? Draw your estimates on the graph. Values for PAO2 and PACO2 have been placed on the graph at a ventilation of 5 L/min. As you fill in the graph, you should assume that the individuals reach a steady state at each level of alveolar ventilation. Recognize that alveolar ventilation cannot reach a steady state at 0 L/min as that particular steady state is referred to as \"death.\" Your curve should not extend to that level of alveolar ventilation. If blood flow (Q) in a given subject remains constant at 5 L/min, indicate the VA/Q ratios for the various minute ventilations on the horizontal axis. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 1 \\n2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 \\nCase 2 An 18-month old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents who witnessed their son aspirate one of his brother\\'s toy soldiers. On exam, the boy is breathing faster than normal and his hemoglobin-oxygen saturation is 90%. You appreciate air movement on both sides but his breath sounds are decreased on one side relative to the other and you hear focal wheezing on the side with the decreased breath sounds. The rest of the pulmonary exam is normal. 1. Consider the boy\\'s lungs as having two compartments. If the blood flow to each compartment is equal, how will the VA/Q ratio in each compartment compare to the child\\'s pre-aspiration VA/Q? 2. How will the PAO2 and PACO2 differ in the two compartments? 3. Compare the partial pressures and contents of oxygen at points A and B? How will this affect the PaO2 and oxygen content when blood from the various alveolar regions combine in the left atrium? What will happen to the (A-a)ΔO2? (Continued on the next page) CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 3 \\nCase 2 (continued) 4. The respiratory therapist gives the boy supplemental oxygen so that the FIO2 increases to 0.4 and the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation improves from 90% to 98%. In which of the two lung compartments is the end-capillary oxygen content (CcO2) increased the most? 5. Why is a child of this age at greater risk for the development of hypoxemia in this clinical scenario compared to an adolescent or adult? 4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 \\nCase 3 A 65 year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fever, chills, dyspnea and a cough productive of yellow-greenish sputum. On physical exam, his vital signs include a RR of 20 breaths/min, HR of 100 beats/min, BP 130/82 mm Hg and a hemoglobin-oxygen saturation of 86%. There are no breath sounds at the base of his left lung. A chest radiograph is shown below: 1. Consider the gentleman\\'s lungs as having two compartments.

What will happen to the (A-a)ΔO2? 4. The respiratory therapist gives the patient supplemental oxygen so that the FIO2 increases to 0.4 but the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation improves by only a few percentage points to 88-89%. Why didn\\'t the patient experience a bigger improvement? 5. When the patient ambulates, his hemoglobin-oxygen saturation falls significantly to 77%. Why does this happen? 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 \\nCase 4 A 21 year-old man is found unresponsive in his apartment by his roommate. Upon evaluation by the medics, his vital signs are: BP 100/56 mm Hg, HR 78 bpm, RR 6 breaths/min and SpO2 of 80% while breathing air. On exam, his pupils are pinpoint and he has clear breath sounds. An arterial blood gas drawn in the Emergency Department while breathing air reveals a PaO2 of 50 mm Hg and a PaCO2 of 56 mm Hg. What is(are) the cause(s) of his hypoxemia? Case 5 An 18 year-old woman presents to the emergency room complaining of shortness of breath over a several day period. Her vital signs are: BP 145/86 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min and SpO2 of 92% while breathing air. Wheezing is heard on auscultation of her chest. An arterial blood gas while breathing air reveals a PaO2 of 70 mm Hg and a PaCO2 of 36 mm Hg. When given an FIO2 of 0.3, her SpO2 of 92% increases to 98%. What is(are) the cause(s) of her hypoxemia?

She and multiple team members will serve as subjects for studies performed at sea level and again following arrival at Cerro de Pasco, Peru (elevation: 4,300 m). While they are there, they will also conduct experiments, including chest radiographs, on lifelong residents of the city, including a cohort of subjects with Chronic Mountain Sickness, a form of altitude illness seen in long-term high altitude residents (> 2500 m) marked by the presence of increased hemoglobin concentration (referred to as excessive erythrocytosis or polycythemia), severe hypoxemia and, in some cases pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure (cor pulmonale). 1. If you were to compare her minute ventilation at rest following arrival at Cerro de Pasco with that measured at sea level at the start of the project, what would you expect to find? What is the mechanism for the observed change? 2. How will her PaCO2 change following arrival at high altitude? What effect would you expect this to have on the change in ventilation described in the first question? 3. Her minute ventilation was measured at sea level while she inhaled varying concentrations of carbon dioxide. In the blank graph on the next page, draw a graph representing the expected changes in ventilation as function of PaCO2? Focus on the general trends rather than specific values. How would you expect this relationship to change when the same experiment is repeated following ascent to Cerro de Pasco? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) On the third day of the study, the team took a break and went for a hike in the hills around town. She noted more difficulty breathing than on a hike the previous day and had trouble keeping up with her hiking partners. That evening, she started to feel out of breath with minor exertion such as walking to the bathroom or changing her clothing. She tried to go to bed, but had difficulty breathing in the supine position. Worried about the situation, she awoke her roommate and went to the project leader. Using equipment available for the research study, they performed a chest radiograph, which is shown below. 4. If you were to compare her minute ventilation at this time to the previous day, what would you expect to find? 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 \\nCase 2 An 11 year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician\\'s office by her parents who were concerned about her performance in school. At their most recent set of parent-teacher conferences, they were informed she was frequently falling asleep in class and was not performing well on her class assignments. Her parents state that she sleeps from 9:30 PM until 7:00 AM most school nights and frequently takes naps after school. When her bedroom door is open at night, they can hear her snoring. She has been overweight (current BMI 36 kg/m2) for many years and does not participate in any afterschool sports programs or other activities. On prior clinic visits, she has been noted to have intermittently elevated blood pressures while a set of laboratory tests done one year ago revealed hyperlipidemia. 1. When you examine the patient, what findings should you look for on exam that could provide insight into the etiology of her problem? The patient is referred for an overnight polysomnogram. A short epoch from that study that displays the pattern of chest wall and abdominal movement and nasal airflow during sleep is provided below (time is on the x-axis): 2. What are the primary findings on this epoch from her sleep study? How do you assess the severity of the problem? 3. What is(are) the pathophysiologic mechanism(s) that account for the observations in the sleep study? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 3 \\nCase 2 (continued) 4. If you were to draw a plot of her oxygen saturation over time in conjunction with this sleep epoch, what pattern would you expect to see (do not worry about the specific values)? How do you account for this pattern? 5. For what complications is this patient at risk if this problem goes untreated? 6. What is the most appropriate treatment and what is the mechanism by which this treatment provides benefit? 4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 \\nCase 3 A 53 year-old man presents to clinic with his wife who is concerned that he is more sleepy than normal during the day. He sleeps about 8 hours per night but does not feel refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. He was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea several years ago but stopped using his CPAP machine because he did not like the facemask. His other medical problems include Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On review of systems, he notes difficulty breathing on exertion for the past year as well as when he is in the supine position. He works as a truck driver, quit smoking 25 years ago and drinks 1-2 beers several nights a week before bed. On examination, his vitals include: temperature 37.6°, BP 153/85, HR 89, RR 11, SpO2 88% breathing air. His BMI is 45 kg/m2. He has a large neck circumference, a small mouth opening and the back of his tongue obstructs the view of his uvula. His breath sounds are diminished throughout and he has no crackles. His heart sounds are distant and hard to appreciate. His neck veins cannot be appreciated. His abdomen is obese and non-tender and he has 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. At the conclusion of your visit, he is sent for several studies. His chest radiograph is as follows: An arterial blood gas is obtained while he is breathing ambient air and reveals: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) 7.36 65 61 HCO3- (mmol/L) 34 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 5 \\nCase 3 (continued) Pulmonary function tests reveal the following: Parameter FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) RV (Liters) DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) 4.0 3.2 0.8 6.0 2.0 25.70 pulmonary function tests?

What changes would you expect to see in his functional residual capacity and respiratory system compliance? 3. What mechanisms account for the PaCO2 observed on his arterial blood gas? 4. A complete blood count is checked and his hemoglobin concentration is noted to be 16.5 g/dL (normal 13-15 g/dL). How do you account for this result? 5. What is the most appropriate intervention to address his hypoxemia? 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 \\nCase 4 A 57 year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit after presenting with worsening dyspnea. He has had problems with exertion over a several month period that limited him to walking only two blocks before having to stop and rest. In the past few days, however, it has become markedly worse and he is now out of breath at rest. He also noted increasing weight and difficulty putting on his shoes and socks. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He was formerly on medications for those issues but has not been taking them for over a year because he lost his insurance after being laid off. Before that, he had a long career working in the shipyards. On exam, he is afebrile with a blood pressure of 117/87 and heart rate of 93. He is using accessory muscles of respiration. His neck veins cannot be visualized due to his body habitus. On lung auscultation, he has bilateral expiratory wheezes. On cardiac exam, the PMI is displaced laterally and he has an S3. His abdominal exam is unremarkable except for edema of the lower abdominal wall. He has 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema and chronic venous stasis changes in his lower extremities. A chest radiograph obtained in the Emergency Department showed the following: An echocardiogram was performed immediately following admission. Two clips from of this echocardiogram can be found on the course website. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 7 \\n Case 4 (continued) 1. Based on the patient\\'s history alone, what are the possible causes of his worsening dyspnea? 2. What do the physical exam, chest radiograph and echocardiogram suggest is the most likely diagnosis? On rounds several days into his admission, the nurse states that he had an odd breathing pattern while asleep the prior night. A movie clip of his breathing pattern is obtained and can be viewed on the course website. 3. In the blank figure below, draw in the pattern of chest wall and abdominal movement and nasal airflow you would expect to see in this patient on an overnight polysomnogram. 4. What is the mechanism for the breathing pattern observed during sleep? 5. What is the most appropriate treatment for the breathing pattern observed during sleep? 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 \\nCPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 5: Why Is This Patient Obstructed Day: 22 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 60 year-old woman presents to the International Clinic complaining of dyspnea on exertion. She has trouble walking uphill and doing chores around the house. She can only walk about 10 minutes on flat ground before having to stop to catch her breath. She also has an intermittent cough that is not productive of sputum. She has not been hospitalized due to respiratory issues and has never smoked cigarettes. She formerly lived in a small, remote village in a low-income country but, following an episode of severe political violence, was relocated to a refugee where she spent several years before coming to the United States. You send the patient for a chest radiograph and then perform pulmonary function testing.

What are the mechanisms of action of the most appropriate medications to start for this patient at this time? How does the observed bronchodilator response on pulmonary function testing affect your decision? 2 CPR-Pulmonary Conference 5 \\nCase 2 A 16 year-old adolescent is brought into the Urgent Care by her mother for evaluation of episodic dyspnea. She has been having repeated attacks of shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness over a several month period. These have occurred mainly at night but she notes a few episodes that have occurred during the day as well, particularly following exertion or in cold weather. Just yesterday, she developed some dyspnea during her gym class at school, which prompted her mother to bring her in after she finished work. Along with her mother and two younger brothers, she currently lives in an old, carpeted apartment in public housing after several years of moving between rental units every few months. She is a non-smoker but her mother and her mother\\'s boyfriend both smoke. They have no pets. She has applied to college and is currently working several jobs outside of school to supplement the income her mother earns in the food service industry. She is sent home from Urgent Care with an albuterol inhaler and given a referral to a local clinic. On follow-up at the clinic two weeks later, she reports that she has been using the albuterol on a daily basis and is also using it several times per week at night when she wakes up with wheezing. Spirometry is performed before and after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator and shows the following results: Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change Parameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC 5.5 4.6 0.76 Pre- 5.0 3.3 0.66 1.

How does this regimen contrast to the baseline treatment regimen in a patient with COPD due to long-time smoking? Case 2 (continued) CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 3 \\n Appropriate treatment was started in clinic. Her asthma improved significantly and she had no serious episodes for several months, after which time she began using her medications irregularly. During an upper respiratory tract infection, she started wheezing and having increasing difficulty breathing. Despite restarting her medications, she had to go to the Emergency Department where she was found to have audible wheezing, use of accessory muscles and a prolonged expiratory phase. An arterial blood gas was performed in the ED while she was breathing air and revealed the following: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 32 56 pH 7.46 - (mmol/L) 23 4. Is the PaCO2 what you would expect for his clinical situation? 5. How does her physiologic reserve differ from that of a 14 month-old girl presenting to the Emergency Department with the same problem? 4 CPR-Pulmonary Conference 5 \\nCase 3 A 42 year-old man with a long smoking history presents to the emergency department complaining of worsening dyspnea and productive cough that developed several days after an upper respiratory tract infection. Before you go and evaluate him, you review his chart in the electronic medical record and note that he underwent diagnostic testing several years ago through his primary care provider after he presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion. The pulmonary function testing, chest radiograph and air arterial blood gas (done while breathing air) performed at that time were as follows: Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change Pre- 2.3 0.7 0.30 5.9 4.5 3.6 % 72 29 - 110 136 150 Post- 2.4 0.7 0.29 - - - % 4 0 N/A - - - Parameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) FRC (Liters) RV (Liters) 3.2 2.4 0.70 5.4 3.3 2.4 pH 7.37 PaCO2 (mm Hg) 48 PaO2 (mm Hg) 56 HCO3- (mmol/L) 31 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 5 \\nCase 3 (continued) His provider started him on inhaled tiotropium and formoterol on a scheduled basis as well as inhaled albuterol to be used as needed. His dyspnea prevented him from continuing his work in construction leading him to be given a permanent disability for which he has been receiving benefits through Social Security for over 2 years. 1. Why was the FRC high? 2. Why was his PaCO2 elevated? 3. What features of his presentation are atypical for COPD secondary to long-standing tobacco use? What other diagnosis should you consider? In the emergency department, an arterial blood gas was obtained while breathing air and showed the following results: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 Oxygen was started at a low flow rate (4 L/min by nasal prongs) and the ABG was repeated: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 4.

Spirometry is performed in clinic and reveals the following: Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change 1. How would you interpret his pulmonary function tests? The patient is started on therapy for the observed abnormality on pulmonary function testing and sent home. Two weeks later, he presents to the emergency department stating that his dyspnea is getting worse despite adhering to the treatment regimen started by his primary care provider. In addition to obtaining a chest radiograph, you review the spirometry results from his prior clinic visit and note the flow-volume loop obtained during that testing session. Each is shown below.

In the emergency department, the respiratory therapist asks if you would like to administer the patient a gas mixture with 79% helium and 20.9% oxygen (referred to as heliox) to help relieve his dyspnea. What is the physiologic rationale behind this suggestion? 8 CPR-Pulmonary Conference 5 \\nCPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 6: Why Is This Patient Restricted Day: 24 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 62 year-old man who works as a postal carrier presents to pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea. He first noticed a subtle but appreciable sense of shortness of breath on his mail route 2 years ago, which he attributed to \"getting older\" and \"being out of shape.\" Despite losing weight and trying to exercise more regularly, his symptoms persisted and have worsened over the past several months such that he cannot go up a flight of stairs without stopping. He also reports a persistent dry cough over a several month period but denies problems with fevers, chills, sweats or hemoptysis. In clinic, pulmonary function testing and a chest radiograph are performed. Arterial blood gases are drawn before and after a six-minute walk test. The results of these tests are displayed below.

What is the differential diagnosis for his presentation and what further test(s) would you order to follow-up these initial results? 2 CPR-Pulmonary Conference 6 \\nCase 2 A 42-year old woman complains of dyspnea on exertion over a 6-month period. She previously was very fit with good exercise tolerance but now becomes dyspneic climbing two flights of stairs and had to stop playing in her weekly soccer game. On review of systems, she denies joint pain or swelling, vision problems, chest pain or palpitations. She is a middle school teacher and a lifelong non-smoker.

CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 5 \\n6 CPR-Pulmonary Conference 6 \\nCase 3 A 51 year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is evaluated in Pulmonary Clinic for reassessment of his respiratory function. He was diagnosed with ALS 1.5 years ago and has recently had a significant decline in his ability to ambulate and use his upper extremities. His wife notes that he has also been more tired and confused in the mornings than he had been previously and takes longer to \"get going\" each day. On exam, he has trouble rising from a seated position and his diaphragmatic excursion is decreased on percussion of the chest. He has no crackles or wheezes, his cardiac exam is normal and he has no lower extremity edema. The respiratory therapist performs several additional tests in clinic including the following: Spirometry: Predicted Measured % Predicted Parameter FEV1 (L) FVC (L) FEV1/FVC 3.35 4.02 0.83 1.78 2.10 0.84 53 52 - End-tidal PCO2: 50 mm Hg Peak Cough Flow: 230 L/min (Normal: > 500 L/min) 1) What would you expect to find if you ordered a chest radiograph on this patient? 2) If you were to send him to the Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory for additional testing, what would you expect to find with each of the following parameters and why would you expect those results (predict the general trends - low, normal, high - rather than specific values)? RV: DLCO: 3) Peak cough flow measurement is similar to measurement of peak expiratory flow during spirometry. The peak flow rate is measured during a voluntary cough. How do you account for the observations on this patient\\'s peak cough flow measurements?

She likes to compete in several triathlons each summer but had to stop training recently because she could not keep up with her partners on their daily runs. She also notes that her breathing feels particularly bad when she gets in the water to swim. On examination, she has symmetric chest expansion and her lungs are clear to auscultation. When she lies in the supine position for the cardiac examination she mentions that her breathing is worse in that position and you note that her abdomen moves inward on inspiration. Her cardiac exam and abdominal exams are unremarkable and she has no lower extremity edema.

She had recently been admitted to the hospital following a fall during which she suffered a pelvic fracture and multiple left-sided rib fractures. The pelvic fracture was repaired in the operating room on hospital day #2 and, following a 2-day stay in the ICU and then another 5 days on the acute care service, she was discharged to the skilled nursing facility where she has been for the past week. She had problems with confusion (delirium) during her hospital stay that have slowly been resolving but make it difficult to obtain further history from her. The nursing notes from the skilled nursing facility state that she was participating in her rehabilitation work, was eating okay with some occasional coughing after swallowing and had not had any fevers or change in her pain medication needs. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for about 40 years but has not smoked since she was admitted to the hospital.

How do you account for this given the likely diagnosis? 4. The patient has a high respiratory rate at the time the blood gas is drawn. If we assume she is taking normal volume breaths, her minute ventilation is also higher than normal. How can she have an essentially normal PaCO2 despite this high minute ventilation? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 3 \\n4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 \\nCase 2 A 27 year-old woman comes to clinic for follow-up from an emergency department visit following an episode of syncope with exercise. This came after six months of increasing dyspnea on exertion and recent onset of dizziness with exertion. She has a history of asthma for which she has been using inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol for the past two years. She has known aspirin sensitivity but has not had problems with exercise-induced bronchospasm. She is worried because she was told that three of her mother\\'s cousins died at a young age of what she understands to be some kind of heart problem.

He describes mild dyspnea at rest that is markedly worsened with exertion. On review of systems, he denies cough, hemoptysis or chest pain but does note that his breathing feels worse when he was in the seated or standing position compared to lying down. His past medical history is noteworthy for the fact that he had a brain abscess five years ago for which he was treated with a long course of antibiotics and which left him with persistent left upper extremity weakness.

She has a history of Hepatitis C but denies having other medical problems. She drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication on a daily basis, and has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for about 30 years. She is not currently working, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend and has not traveled out of the Seattle area in over 10 years. On arrival, her vitals include a temperature of 39.0°C, BP of 78/46, HR 134, RR 40 and an oxygen saturation of 70% breathing air. She is placed on a high flow nasal cannula with an FIO2 of 0.8 and her oxygen saturation rises to 75%. On physical exam, she is diaphoretic and using accessory muscles of respiration. She has dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at her left base. She is tachycardic with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium. Her skin is moist with warm hands and feet and some mottling of her distal extremities. Her labs reveal a WBC 1.57 x 103cells/uL with a predominance of neutrophils and some immature granulocytes. A portable chest radiograph is obtained and is shown below: An arterial blood gas was obtained while the patient was on the high flow nasal cannula and revealed: pH 7.08 PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 58 45 - (mmol/L) Lactate (mEq/L) 16 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) 1.

CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 3 \\n4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 \\nCase 2 An 18 month-old girl is brought in to the Emergency Department by her parents for evaluation of cough that has been present for the past 3 days. The cough is worse at night, is not productive of sputum and is often quite loud. The child has also had a stuffy, runny nose and has felt warm to the touch over these three days. The mother thinks her daughter may have been wheezing the previous night. She is not drooling, has been eating normally and has not had emesis or diarrhea. Aside from a history of eczema, the child is otherwise healthy and has had normal growth and development. There is no family history of asthma but her 6 year-old brother has been ill with cold symptoms. Her parents are migrant farm workers who entered the country as part of the Guest Worker program. They anticipate leaving town to work on another harvest in a few months. The patient is up-to-date on her immunizations, having been taken by her parents to occasional migrant worker clinics in towns where they are working (Further information on the guest worker program can be found at: https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/advocacy-and- programs/guestworker-programs). On exam, her vitals include temperature 37.5°C, blood pressure 90/56, heart rate 140, respiratory rate 36 and SpO2 95% breathing ambient air. She is alert and makes good eye contact but appears in mild respiratory distress. Her cry is hoarse and her cough sounds somewhat like a seal. She is not drooling, has clear mucus rhinorrhea and no nasal flaring. The pharynx is slightly injected, but there is no tonsilar enlargement or asymmetry. On lung exam she has subcostal retractions and some mild stridor that worsen when agitated. There are no wheezes or crackles. Her heart rate is rapid and regular without murmurs. She has no rashes or mottling and her extremities appear well-perfused. Laboratory studies are not ordered. A plain radiograph of the neck is shown below.

What solutions can you envision on a local level to address these problems? 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 \\nCase 3 A 50 year-old man presents to clinic with a 5-week history of fever, night sweats, and cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum. He also notes that his clothes have become very loose during this time. Aside from several episodes of pneumonia when he was a child, he has no other past medical history. He is marginally housed and has spent time living in the shelters for many years. He is not aware of any sick contacts with pulmonary disease. He smokes a few cigarettes per week, and works as an itinerant laborer on construction projects in the city. Physical exam reveals a slightly ill-appearing man with mild temporal wasting, decreased muscle bulk in all extremities and bronchial breath sounds heard over the right anterior chest. His chest radiograph is shown below. 1. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? 2. What features of his presentation argue against this being a case of community-acquired pneumonia?

Why did he develop signs of active disease at this point in his life? 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 \\nCase 4 A 27 year-old man presents to the emergency department with a three to four week history of dry cough and a one week history of worsening dyspnea. He denies hemoptysis and chest pain but notes some subjective fevers and unintentional weight loss. He has no history of lung disease and is not taking any medications. Following a sports-related injury several years ago, he became dependent on prescription pain medications, and one year ago started injecting heroin due to the high street cost of the pain medications, leading him to eventually lose his job. Born and raised in northern Idaho, he currently lives with several friends and has not traveled outside the Pacific Northwest except for a trip to California and Arizona several years ago. In the Emergency Department, his vitals include temperature 38.6°C, BP 119/79, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 25 and an SpO2 78% breathing ambient air. On exam, he is tachypneic and using accessory muscles of respiration. He is resonant to percussion throughout with symmetric breath sounds and fine inspiratory crackles in all fields. His neck veins are flat and he has no murmurs, lower extremity edema, lymphadenopathy or rash. His labs reveal a WBC 2.07 x 103cells/uL with 70% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes. A portable chest radiograph is obtained and is shown below: 1. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? 2. What items would you consider on the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and this radiographic pattern? CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 9 \\nCase 4 (continued) The patient was initially placed on high flow oxygen by nasal cannula but subsequently worsened and required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation.

INTRODUCTION We first covered the thoracic wall and the pleural cavities in MCBD.The first part of this chapter will briefly review and expand upon these regions before we continue along the airway from the mediastinum into the lungs. THORACIC WALL Review the anatomy from MCBD presented in bullet points below. Landmarks C7, vertebra prominens: the cupula, the dome of the cervical portion of parietal pleura, extends above the first rib (Figure 1) T3: the spine of the scapula T7: inferior angle of the scapula T12: inferior extent of parietal pleura Figure 1. Landmarks of the thoracic wall CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 1 \\nRibs True ribs (1-7) attached directly to the sternum (Figure 2) False ribs (8-12) attached to the costal cartilage of the rib above Floating ribs (11-12) with no attachment to the sternum Features of a typical rib: head, neck, tubercle, angle, body, costal groove, costal cartilage Sternum Manubrium (spans T3-T4 vertebral levels) o Jugular (suprasternal) notch Body (spans T5-T9) Sternal angle at junction of manubrium and body (T4/5); defines thoracic plane Xiphoid process (T10) Figure 2. Bony thorax Clinical correlate: The weakest part of a rib is at the angle. It may fracture from direct blows or indirectly from crushing injuries involving the thorax. Flail chest occurs when multiple adjacent ribs are broken in at least two places, separating a portion of the rib cage from the rest of the thoracic wall. When this occurs, the separated portion moves in the opposite (paradoxical) direction during breathing-inward with inspiration and outward with expiration. Joints Costovertebral joint (Figure 3) Costotransverse joint Figure 3. Joints of the thoracic wall CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 2 \\nApertures Superior thoracic aperture formed by T1 vertebra, 1st ribs, and manubrium where trachea, esophagus, and neurovasculature cross between neck and superior mediastinum (see Figure 2) Inferior thoracic aperture covered by diaphragm with openings for aorta, esophagus, and IVC Intercostal spaces Intercostal muscles: external, internal, and innermost (Figure 4) Neurovasculature: anterior and posterior intercostal a/v, intercostal n Figure 4. Intercostal spaces. * Recall that these vessels are either posterior or anterior. Note where the chest tube is placed to avoid neurovasculature. MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION The diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration (Figure 5). It is a domed, sheet-like muscle with a large central tendon. It attaches to the structures that define the inferior thoracic aperture, the xiphoid process, inner surfaces of the costal cartilages that make up the costal margin, and ribs 11 and 12. Additionally it extends two muscular bands, the right and left crura (\"legs\" in Latin, singular = crus), to attach to the lumbar vertebral bodies inferiorly. Figure 5. Diaphragm. Right and left domes of the diaphragm (or hemi-diaphragms) indicated on AP and lateral chest x-rays as magenta and green dashed lines, respectively. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 3 \\nThe diaphragm consists of the right and left domes (or hemi-diaphragms), which can be identified separately in radiographic images (Figure 5). The right dome covers the relatively large liver, which pushes this dome higher than the left by about 2 cm or more. Recall that the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3, 4, 5). Motor fibers in the phrenic nerve initiate contraction of the muscle, which pulls the diaphragm inferiorly to increase the vertical dimension of the thoracic cavity. The resulting decrease in intrathoracic pressure causes inspiration. Clinical correlate: We have already considered how sensory fibers within the phrenic nerve cause pain from the diaphragm and nearby structures (like the liver) to refer to the shoulder region. Direct damage to a phrenic nerve will cause paralysis of the ipsilateral hemi-diaphragm due to the loss of motor innervation. Additionally, patients with spinal cord injuries at or above the origin of the phrenic nerve (C3, 4, 5) will often require permanent ventilation support. The external intercostal muscles also aid in inspiration during quiet breathing (Figure 6). Briefly, the external intercostal muscles elevate the ribs to increase the anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions of the thoracic cavity during inspiration. The accessory muscles of inspiration assist in elevating the ribs to expand the thoracic cavity (Figure 6). These muscles include the scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, pectoralis major and minor, serratus anterior, and others. Many of these muscles also act on the upper limb, so they are most effective for inspiration when the upper limb is stabilized as in the \"tripod position,\" hands resting on the knees. This position is often observed in individuals catching their breath after strenuous exercise or in patients suffering from respiratory distress. Expiration during quiet breathing does not require muscular contraction; it occurs with elastic recoil of the diaphragm, chest wall, and lungs. Accessory muscles of expiration pull down on the rib cage to increase pressure in the thoracic cavity during forced expiration (Figure 6). These include the internal and innermost intercostals and the anterior abdominal wall muscles identified during MCBD.Figure 6. Muscles of respiration. The external intercostals aid the diaphragm during quiet breathing. The rest of the labeled muscles are some of the accessory muscles of respiration that we\\'ve seen in previous blocks. The picture on the right shows a patient with COPD with upper limbs stabilized in the tripod position. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 4 \\nPLEURAE AND PLEURAL CAVITY We have previously covered the concept of a serous sac-with its parietal and visceral layers-and the thin layer of serous fluid that fills the narrow cavity within these sacs. Recall that there is a separate pleural sac for each of the lungs. The parietal pleura lies against the deep surface of the thoracic wall. It is continuous with the visceral pleura, which covers the surface of the lungs. The pleural cavity is the slit-like space between these two layers. Serous fluid in this cavity allows the parietal and visceral layers to glide smoothly over one another during breathing. Review the anatomy from MCBD presented in bullets below (Figure 7). Parietal pleura Surfaces: Costal, diaphragmatic, mediastinal, cervical (cupula) Innervation: somatic, pain transmitted by intercostal and phrenic nerves depending on location Visceral pleura Innervation: visceral, insensitive to pain Pleural cavity Costodiaphragmatic recess (seen as costophrenic angle in radiographs) Costomediastinal recess: between costal and mediastinal surfaces \"Rule of twos\": the parietal pleura extends to the 12th rib posteriorly (mid-scapular), 10th rib laterally (mid-axillary), and 8th rib anteriorly (mid-clavicular). At each location, the inferior extent of the lungs is approximately two ribs higher. Figure 7. Overview of the pleural cavity THE ROOT OF THE LUNG AND HILUM ROOT OF THE LUNG The root of the lung is the bundle of structures that travel together into the lung from the mediastinum. Its major components are the main bronchus, pulmonary artery, and the pulmonary veins (Figure 8). Medially, these structures branch off or drain into larger structures in the mediastinum, as described below. We introduced the trachea in the Superior Mediastinum syllabus. This part of the airway begins at the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage-where it is continuous with the larynx-and continues inferiorly through the neck and superior mediastinum (see Figure 10). C-shaped hyaline cartilages protect and maintain the airway (while allowing the esophagus to expand posteriorly). Near the level of the thoracic plane, the trachea bifurcates into the right and left main bronchi, which travel in the root of the lung. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 5 \\nThe large blood vessels in the root of the lung are the pulmonary arteries and veins (Figure 8). The right and left pulmonary arteries branch off the pulmonary trunk inferior to the arch of the aorta. The pulmonary veins, two on each side, drain into the left atrium. Figure 8. Root of the lung In addition to these large structures, the pulmonary plexus, bronchial arteries, and lymphatics also travel in the root of the lung. The pulmonary plexus of nerves travels on the surface of the pulmonary arteries and bronchi to innervate the smooth muscle in each (Figure 8, inset). The pulmonary plexus, like typical plexuses in the thoracoabdominal cavity, contains preganglionic parasympathetic, postganglionic sympathetic, and visceral afferent fibers. The parasympathetic division-from CN X-is responsible for bronchoconstriction. The sympathetic division-from sympathetic chain ganglia via the pulmonary splanchnic nerves-is responsible for bronchodilation and vasoconstriction. The small bronchial arteries off the thoracic aorta travel along the posterior aspects of the main bronchi to supply oxygenated blood to the bronchial tree. The lymphatic drainage of the lung is described in its own sub-section below (see Figure 12). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 6 \\nHILUM As structures in the root continue distally, they will enter the lung at the hilum (Figure 9). The hilum is the two-dimensional entry into the lung located on its medial surface (think of the root like a hallway and the hilum like a door at the end of that hallway). The parietal pleura along the mediastinal surface reflects over the root of the lung, where it is continuous with the visceral pleura. The borders of the hilum are defined by the reflection of pleura from the root onto the lung. At the inferior aspect of the root and hilum, the pleural reflection continues inferiorly as the pulmonary ligament, a double layer of pleura that provides a firmer attachment to the mediastinum. The anatomical relationships at the right and left hila are slightly different. On both sides, the main bronchus is situated posteriorly with the two pulmonary veins anterior and inferior to it. On the right side, the right pulmonary artery is anterior to the right main bronchus. On the left, the left pulmonary artery is superior to the left main bronchus. Figure 9. Medial surface of the lungs. Anterior view shown at top with labeled lobes. Some root structures within the hilum have just branched in these images (conceptualize the arrangement one pulmonary artery and two pulmonary veins on each side). The impressions of nearby structures are labeled in italics. LUNGS LOBES Recall the basic organization of the lungs from MCBD (Figure 9). The left lung has an upper and lower lobe separated by the oblique fissure, which ends anteroinferiorly at the level of the 6th costal cartilage. The upper lobe of the left lung has the cardiac notch to accommodate the heart with the lingula just inferior to it. The right lung has an additional middle lobe separated from the upper lobe by the horizontal fissure, which roughly follows the course of the right 4th rib. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 7 \\nANATOMICAL RELATIONSHIPS Structures adjacent to the medial surfaces of the lungs form \"impressions\" on the lungs during the embalming process. These impressions are artifacts (not present in life) that you do not need to memorize, but they will help you to visualize important relationships. On the right side, the lung is adjacent to the SVC and the arch of the azygos vein (Figure 9). The SVC drains into the right atrium, which forms the majority of the cardiac impression on the right side. The right lung is also closely associated with the esophagus. On the left side, the lung is adjacent to the arch of the aorta and the descending aorta (Figure 9). The left ventricle is the portion of the heart that resides next to the lung. TRACHEOBRONCHIAL TREE The term tracheobronchial tree is used to describe the airway from the trachea to the alveoli in the lungs. In the analogy, the trachea is the \"trunk\" that splits into the right and left main (primary) bronchi to supply the right and left lungs, respectively. The carina is an internal cartilaginous ridge at this bifurcation. As in the trachea, the main bronchi have C-shaped cartilage protecting the airway anteriorly. The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertically oriented than the left. The main bronchi branch into the lobar (secondary) bronchi, which begin to have scattered cartilaginous plates instead of rings. In the left lung-where there are only two lobes-the left main bronchus bifurcates into the upper and lower lobar bronchi. In the right-where there are three lobes-the relatively short right main bronchus branches into the upper lobar bronchus and the bronchus intermedius (intermediate bronchus). The bronchus intermedius continues inferiorly before branching into the middle and lower lobar bronchi. Figure 10. Tracheobronchial tree CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 8 \\nClinical correlate: Obstruction of the airway from inhalation of foreign bodies is more likely to occur on the right. Because the right main bronchus is wider and more vertically oriented than the left, objects tend to continue down this path. The image on the left shows a foreign body (yellow arrows) trapped in the right main bronchus (the right lung is hyper-lucent and inflated due to air trapping). Similarly, if an endotracheal tube (ETT) is advanced too far into the airway, it is likely to enter the right main bronchus, blocking the left main bronchus (tip of ETT indicated by yellow arrow and carina indicated by red arrow in image on the right). In this case, the alveoli on the left side will collapse (atelectasis). If the ETT is advanced further into the intermediate bronchus, the right upper lobe will also be blocked. The lobar bronchi branch into segmental (tertiary) bronchi (Figure 11). Each lung has 8-10 segmental bronchi (depending on normal anatomical variations) that you do not need to memorize by name. You do need to understand that each segmental bronchus serves a defined bronchopulmonary segment, a region of lung separated from other segments by connective tissue. Within a bronchopulmonary segment, a segmental bronchus-along with its accompanying vasculature-continues to branch into further \"generations\" of conducting bronchi down to the level of terminal bronchioles (bronchi contain cartilage, bronchioles do not). The respiratory zone of the airway begins with respiratory bronchioles, which continue as alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, all with many individual alveoli. Figure 11. Bronchopulmonary segments Clinical correlate: The connective tissue between lung segments impedes the spread of infection within the lung. Additionally, the small number of blood vessels within these partitions allows for surgical removal of isolated segments-a segmentectomy-with relatively little bleeding. This is especially beneficial in cases of early stage lung cancer in patients with cardiopulmonary disease that limits gas exchange in the lungs. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Lungs and Pleural Spaces 9 \\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE OF THE LUNG The basic pattern of lymph drainage in the lung is from the periphery to the hilum (Figure 12). Subpleural and interlobar plexuses drain toward the deep lymphatic plexuses which generally follow the vessels along the tracheobronchial tree. The lymph nodes along the course of the lymphatic vessels are named for their location. Inside the lung, there are numerous pulmonary lymph nodes along the bronchi. Several large bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes lie adjacent to the main bronchi at the hilum. These drain into the tracheobronchial nodes near the bifurcation of the trachea and then into the tracheal (paratracheal) nodes. Lymphatic vessels from the hilar and paratracheal regions drain into the bronchomediastinal trunks, which drain into the right lymphatic or thoracic ducts before draining into the systemic circulation at the venous angles. Figure 12. Lymphatic drainage of the lungs Clinical correlate: The broncho- pulmonary (hilar) lymph nodes can be enlarged by metastatic cancer, infection, or sarcoidosis, obscuring the right and/or left heart borders (yellow arrows).

INTRODUCTION In the previous chapter, we defined the mediastinum and separated this space into superior and inferior mediastina. We also covered the pericardium and how it separates the inferior mediastinum into anterior, middle, and posterior mediastina before we focused on the middle mediastinum and its contents. We will now focus on the superior mediastinum and its contents. OVERVIEW OF THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM We previously defined the inferior border of the superior mediastinum as the thoracic plane. The superior border of the superior mediastinum is the superior thoracic aperture defined by the T1 vertebra, 1st rib, and manubrium (Figure 1). Many structures and fascial planes are continuous across the superior thoracic aperture, providing a possible route for infections to spread from the neck into the thoracic cavity. Much of the mediastinum, including the superior mediastinum, contains fat and loose connective tissue that surrounds the viscera in this region. These help to make the mediastinum a highly mobile region capable of accommodating movement and pressure changes in the thoracic cavity from processes such as respiration, blood circulation, and swallowing. Figure 1. Divisions of the mediastinum CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Superior Mediastinum 1 \\nREVIEW OF CIRCULATORY DEVELOPMENT The appearance and relationships of many of the structures in the superior mediastinum are best understood in the context of the development of these structures. Here, we will briefly review some key concepts covered in the Anatomy & Embryology of the Heart chapter as they relate to the superior mediastinum. In general, there is a shunting of arterial blood to the left during development. The adult arch of the aorta is formed by the aortic sac, 4th aortic arch, and the left dorsal aorta (Figure 2). The ligamentum arteriosum is the remnant of the ductus arteriosus that was formed by the 6th aortic arch on the left side to bypass the lungs (Figure 2 & 4). In the adult, it can be seen in the superior mediastinum connecting the arch of the aorta and the pulmonary trunk. On the right side, the 6th aortic arch degenerates. Because of this pattern of development, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the arch of the aorta at the ligamentum arteriosum while the right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the right subclavian artery (see Figures 4 & 6). Figure 2. Development of arterial structures. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Superior Mediastinum 2 \\nVenous blood is shunted to the right during development. In the superior mediastinum, the anterior cardinal veins anastomose to form the longer left brachiocephalic vein (Figure 3). The proximal portion of the left anterior cardinal vein degenerates, leaving the right anterior cardinal vein to form the SVC.Figure 3. Development of venous drainage. Note that these structures are shown from a posterior view. We will cover the development of the esophagus and lungs more thoroughly in the Energetics & Homeostasis block, but understanding that the trachea initially buds from the embryological foregut helps to explain their close association. CONTENTS OF THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM With the exception of the thymus, the viscera within the superior mediastinum are hollow in order to conduct fluid (great vessels), air (trachea), or food (esophagus). We will cover the viscera and other contents of the superior mediastinum in a general anterior to posterior order. The thymus lies deep to the manubrium and sternum in both the superior and anterior divisions of the mediastinum (Figure 4). Recall from the Invaders & Defenders block that it is the site of T-lymphocyte maturation most active during infancy and pre-adolescence. It atrophies after the onset of puberty, becoming largely replaced by fat tissue making it relatively indistinguishable in adults. The brachiocephalic veins are formed by the union of the subclavian vein and internal jugular vein (IJV) draining the upper limbs and the head/neck, respectively (brachio- for \"arm\" and cephalic for \"head\"; Figure 4). The left brachiocephalic vein crosses anteriorly over the three main branches of the arch of the aorta, making it longer than the more vertically oriented right brachiocephalic vein. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Superior Mediastinum 3 \\nThe superior vena cava (SVC) is formed by the union of the right and left brachiocephalic veins in the superior mediastinum (Figure 4). It continues inferiorly into the middle mediastinum and drains blood from all regions superior to the diaphragm (except the heart and lungs) into the right atrium. The arch of the aorta is the continuation of the ascending aorta after it passes through the thoracic plane at the level of the sternal angle (Figure 4). It arches posteriorly and to the left, crossing back over the thoracic plane to continue as the descending (thoracic) aorta in the posterior mediastinum. The arch of the aorta gives off three prominent branches in the superior mediastinum: the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid, and left subclavian. The brachiocephalic trunk (or artery) heads superiorly and to the right before branching into the right common carotid and right subclavian arteries. The left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery branch directly off the arch of the aorta-no intermediate brachiocephalic artery-to supply the left head/neck and left upper limb, respectively. Note how there are two brachiocephalic veins and only one brachiocephalic artery. The trachea is the large midline airway that is continuous with the larynx and spans the neck and superior mediastinum (Figure 4). The C-shaped hyaline cartilage rings of the trachea that protect and maintain an open airway can be felt along the neck superior to the suprasternal notch. The trachea is immediately anterior to the esophagus; the tracheal rings are incomplete posteriorly, allowing for food boluses to slightly expand the esophagus without resistance. The trachea bifurcates near the level of the thoracic plane into the right and left main bronchi, which will continue to the lungs in the posterior mediastinum. The bronchopulmonary tree and the associated lymphatic drainage is covered in detail in the Lungs and Pleural Spaces chapter. The esophagus is the midline passageway for liquid and food boluses (Figure 4). It is continuous with the laryngopharynx and spans the neck, superior and posterior mediastina, and a small portion of the abdomen before emptying its contents into the stomach. Figure 4. Contents of the superior mediastinum. The dashed line in green represents the thoracic plane. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Superior Mediastinum 4 \\n Figure 5. Axial CT of the superior mediastinum. These axial CT images with IV contrast highlight the important anatomical relationships of the superior mediastinum at vertebral levels T3 and T4 (inset shows planes). The left brachiocephalic vein is less radiodense than the right because contrast was injected in a vein in the right upper limb, which travels back to the heart before being pumped into the aorta and its branches (also radiodense). Note the shunting of venous blood to the right, the branches of the aorta arising progressively more posterior and to the left, and the relationships of the air-filled trachea and esophagus, the latter descending just anterior to the vertebrae. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Superior Mediastinum 5 \\nNERVES IN THE SUPERIOR MEDIASTINUM The phrenic nerves were covered in the previous chapter as originating from C3, 4, 5 and innervating the fibrous pericardium and mediastinal parietal pleura (sensory) and diaphragm (sensory and motor). They pass through the superior mediastinum between the large veins and arteries (recall that the great veins are anterior to the arteries) before passing anterior to the root of the lung and continuing in the middle mediastinum (see Figure 4). The vagus nerves (CN X) were also covered previously as supplying parasympathetic and visceral afferent fibers to multiple targets in the neck, thorax, and abdomen, including the heart via the cardiac plexus (Figure 6). In the neck, CN x travels between the common carotid artery and IJV (see Anterior Triangle chapter). In the superior mediastinum, the right vagus nerve gives off the right recurrent laryngeal nerve that loops around the right subclavian artery to ascend obliquely toward the larynx in the tracheoesophageal groove. The left vagus nerve continues inferiorly before giving off the left recurrent laryngeal nerve that loops around the arch of the aorta posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum to ascend vertically toward the larynx in the tracheoesophageal groove (Figure 4 & 6). Both vagus nerves contribute fibers to the cardiac and pulmonary plexuses, pass posterior to the root of the lung, and continue inferiorly in the posterior mediastinum as part of the esophageal plexus. Figure 6. Nerves of the superior mediastinum. The sympathetic innervation of the thoracic viscera originates from spinal cord levels T1-T4 (recall that cardiac referred pain corresponds to these dermatomes). Like the parasympathetic fibers from CN X, the postganglionic fibers from the sympathetic chain ganglia travel in the cardiac, pulmonary, and esophageal plexuses to reach their targets (Figure 6).

He first noticed a subtle but appreciable sense of shortness of breath on his mail route 2 years ago, which he attributed to \"getting older\" and \"being out of shape.\" Despite losing weight and trying to exercise more regularly, his symptoms persisted and have worsened over the past several months such that he cannot go up a flight of stairs without stopping. He also reports a persistent dry cough over a several month period but denies problems with fevers, chills, sweats or hemoptysis. In clinic, pulmonary function testing and a chest radiograph are performed. Arterial blood gases are drawn before and after a six-minute walk test. The results of these tests are displayed below. Measured % Predicted Parameter FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/VC TLC (Liters) RV (Liters) DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) Predicted 4.00 2.61 0.65 6.55 2.54 23.60 2.16 1.67 0.77 3.34 1.33 8.87 54 64 N/A 51 52 38 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 1 \\nCase 1 (Continued) 1. What is the observed abnormality on his pulmonary function tests? The FEV1 and FVC are both reduced but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. This pattern is typically seen in restrictive processes but you need lung volume measurements and, in particular, a reduced TLC (< 80% predicted) in order to confirm the presence of restriction. The TLC is markedly reduced in this case, confirming that the patient does, in fact, have a restrictive ventilatory defect. The residual volume, functional residual capacity and DLCO are also reduced (the implications of these findings are discussed below). Residual volume is the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of a forced exhalation. This is typically decreased in patients with an intraparenchymal source of restriction, such as pulmonary fibrosis, because the increased elastic recoil associated with the fibrotic changes, holds the airways open (\"tethering\"), allowing more air to escape on exhalation such that the system goes to a lower volume. In restrictive processes due to an extraparenchymal problem such as a neuromuscular disease, RV may be normal or even increased because the individual lacks the muscular strength necessary to exhale to a very low volume. The fact that the RV is low in this case points to the fact that the restrictive physiology is likely due to an intraparenchymal problem. 2. How do the DLCO and RV help in determining the etiology of his presentation? Restrictive pathophysiology can develop due to processes within the lung parenchyma (e.g., pulmonary fibrosis) or processes outside the lung (e.g., neuromuscular diseases such as Duchene muscular dystrophy). The DLCO and RV can be used to distinguish between these two broad categories. The DLCO gives us information about the total surface area available for gas exchange. With processes that affect the lung parenchyma, you would expect problems with the surface area for gas exchange and, as a result, the DLCO is reduced. When the patient has restrictive pathophysiology due to a chest wall or neuromuscular problem, the underlying lung parenchyma is typically normal. The surface area for gas exchange is preserved and the DLCO is typically normal. In this patient, the DLCO is markedly reduced, suggesting that the restrictive physiology is due to a problem with the lungs. 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\n Case 1 (continued) 3. How do the findings on the chest radiograph relate to the results of his pulmonary function tests? There are several features of his chest radiograph that correspond to findings on his pulmonary function testing. First, the lung volumes are low. A comparison of this film and one with normal lung volumes is shown in the figure below. The low volume is not due to the fact that he did not take an adequate breath and is, instead, an important finding related to the restrictive pathophysiology seen on his PFTs, in particular the low TLC and the low FVC.FVC is reduced in restrictive processes because, in essence, there is not a lot of air to exhale if the individual is limited in the amount of air they can take in on inhalation. He also has bilateral diffuse opacities that are greater in the lung bases than in the apical regions. These opacities are \"reticular\" or \"net-like\" in appearance suggesting that he has some process that is affecting the lung interstitium (as distinct from the fluffy, cotton ball-like opacities that occur when a process like pneumonia or edema fills up the alveoli). You would expect that whatever is causing these opacities is adversely affecting the surface area available for gas exchange, which, as noted above, manifests as a decreased DLCO on the PFTs. In terms of other aspects of the full chest radiograph interpretation: The bones and soft-tissues are normal. The trachea is on the midline and is of normal caliber. The aortic arch is mildly enlarged and there is some prominence to the hila bilaterally (especially on the right). The heart size is normal but the borders are somewhat obscured bilaterally. The diaphragms are seen along their entire length bilaterally with normal sulci. 4. What change would you predict in his functional residual capacity (FRC)? FRC, the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of tidal exhalation, is determined by the balance between the tendency of the lung to recoil to a lower volume and the tendency of the chest wall to recoil out to a larger volume. Given the findings on chest radiography and pulmonary function testing, you would suspect this patient has a fibrotic process involving his lung parenchyma. The fibrotic changes increase the elastic recoil of the lungs. As a result, in the ongoing battle between the lungs and chest wall, the lung gains the advantage and the system is pulled down to a lower volume at the end of exhalation. Note that the low lung volumes are not due to the fact that he did not take an adequate breath and are, instead, an important finding related to his restrictive pathophysiology and, in particularly, increased lung recoil. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 3 \\nCase 1 (continued) 5. What is the differential diagnosis for his presentation and what further test(s) would you order to follow-up these initial results? The combination of a restrictive process and a low DLCO is strongly suggestive of the presence of some form of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Based on the chest radiograph, you would be suspicious that this patient has some form of pulmonary fibrosis. In this case, the clinical history is consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, fibrosis can occur as a result of a variety of disorders including asbestosis, silicosis or chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, among others. You would want to take a very detailed occupational history, as well as carefully review any other exposures he may have in his home or work environment. 4 The next most appropriate diagnostic test would be a High Resolution Chest CT to get more detailed images of his lung parenchyma. An example of an image from a CT scan of a patient with IPF demonstrating traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing is shown in the image below (You will not be responsible for interpreting lung CT images on the exams in the course). Based on the results of this, you would then decide whether or not he needs a surgical lung biopsy for confirmation of the diagnosis. In the setting of characteristic imaging and the appropriate clinical history, a presumptive diagnosis of IPF can be made without biopsy but if the imaging or other features of the presentation are not clear then biopsy would be indicated.

She previously was very fit with good exercise tolerance but now becomes dyspneic climbing two flights of stairs and had to stop playing in her weekly soccer game. On review of systems, she denies joint pain or swelling, vision problems, chest pain or palpitations. She is a middle school teacher and a lifelong non-smoker. She is married, with two children and has no pets. A plain chest radiograph and a slice from her Chest CT scan are shown below: CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 5 \\nCase 2 (continued) Her pulmonary function testing results include the following: Predicted Measured Parameter FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) 3.3 2.9 0.88 4.10 22.4 2.27 1.83 0.81 3.20 11.5 65 52 % Predicted 68 64 - 76 52 - (mmol/L) 21 20 Arterial blood gases are drawn while breathing air at rest and after a 6-minute walk test. PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 Condition Rest Exercise pH 7.41 7.44 34 30 1. What are the key findings on her chest radiograph? There are two key findings on this chest radiograph: The lung fields demonstrate bilateral interstitial opacities that are more prominent on the right and in the bases of her lungs. There is also hilar fullness bilaterally consistent with lymphadenopathy. In terms of other aspects of the radiograph interpretation: The lung volumes are normal. The bones and soft-tissues are normal. There are two breast shadows. The trachea is on the midline and has normal caliber. The aortic arch is normal. The heart size is normal with clear left and right heart borders. The diaphragms have a normal rounded shape and can be visualized along their entire length. There is no blunting of the costophrenic sulci. 2. How would you interpret her pulmonary function tests? The FEV1 and FVC are both reduced but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. This pattern is suggestive of a restrictive process. The TLC is reduced, indicating that the patient does, in fact, have a restrictive defect. The DLCO is decreased indicating that the restrictive pathophysiology is the result of an intraparenchymal process. 3. How do you account for the PaCO2 at rest and the change in her PaO2 on the arterial blood gases performed before and after exercise? The PaCO2 is mildly reduced at 34 mm Hg, indicating that the patient is hyperventilating. You will recall from earlier in the course that whenever the PaCO2 deviates from normal it is due to a change in the balance between CO2 production on the one hand and alveolar ventilation on the other. In her case, there is no reason to suspect she has increased CO2 production (there is no mention of fever, or infection and she remains at rest). As a result, the decrease in PaCO2 is related to the fact that alveolar ventilation has increased, most likely as a result of an increase in minute ventilation. The increase in minute ventilation could be due to anxiety related to pain from the arterial blood gas, but the fact that the pH is close to normal suggests this is a chronic process and CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 6 \\nCase 2 (continued) the change in PaCO2 is not due to acute hyperventilation. An important clue to the cause of her hypocarbia can be found in another result from her blood gas, the PaO2. She has hypoxemia, which you will recall from the session on ventilatory control disorders earlier in the course, stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors leading to an increase in minute ventilation. This response is known as the hypoxic ventilatory response. If minute ventilation increases while the physiologic dead space remains the same, alveolar ventilation increases. If this happens in the face of constant CO2 production, then PaCO2 will go down. Another factor that might contribute to the increase in ventilation is stimulation of irritant receptors in the lung by the parenchymal lung disease seen on her imaging. With exercise, her PaO2 falls even lower. There are several reasons why this occurs. Given the changes seen on her chest imaging, you would expect the alveolar-capillary barrier to be thickened, thereby slowing the rate of diffusion across the barrier. At rest, this is not an issue as the red blood cells still spend enough time in the pulmonary capillary to allow complete equilibration to occur. With exercise, however, red cell transit time is shortened as cardiac output increases. If transit time is shortened enough, the capillary PO2 does not equilibrate fully with the alveolar PO2. This subsequently leads to a decrease in the PaO2. While this phenomenon likely plays a role in some patients, particularly those with pulmonary fibrosis, the most important factor contributing to worsening hypoxemia with exercise is increasing heterogeneity of VA/Q ratios. With exercise, cardiac output increases. This can overcome hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to increased perfusion of poorly CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) ventilated lung units. In addition, although blood flow increases throughout the lung, ventilation does not increase in a uniform manner. Due to regional variation in lung compliance, particularly in a patient with parenchymal lung disease the change in pressure on inhalation yields different changes in volume and, therefore, ventilation between lung units (See Chapter 6, Figure 6-12C). If ventilation fails to increase as much as blood flow to a given unit, the VA/Q ratio goes down. As the number of low VA/Q areas increase, gas exchange worsens. Areas of high VA/Q ratios also develop during exercise but, as noted in Chapter 6, these regions cannot make up for the problems caused by the low VA/Q areas. Any increase in VA/Q heterogeneity causes hypoxemia. Finally, with exercise, tissue oxygen extraction increases to meet the increasing oxygen consumption requirements of the exercising muscles. As a result, mixed venous oxygen content falls. In the presence of low VA/Q or shunt, the lower mixed venous oxygen content contributes to a decreased PaO2. In low VA/Q areas, the capillary PO2 equilibrates at a lower PO2 than in normal units while in shunt units, the blood does not load any oxygen as it moves through the pulmonary capillaries. This oxygen-depleted blood then lowers the arterial oxygen content when mixing occurs in the left atrium. An electrocardiogram is performed and shows sinus rhythm with a rate of 58 bpm and a normal axis. The PR interval is 250 msec and the QRS and QT intervals are normal. There is no chamber enlargement, ST changes or T-wave inversions. She underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed the following results: Bacterial gram\\'s stain and culture: negative Fungal stains: negative AFB stain: negative. Culture pending Transbronchial biopsies were performed and the key finding is shown in the image below 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) 4. What is the most likely diagnosis? In what other disease processes may you see variants of this finding on biopsy? The key finding in this histopathologic image of her transbronchial biopsy specimen is the presence of a non-caseating granuloma with multinucleated giant cells (black arrows). This is a critical finding which, in conjunction with the other clinical information provided in this case, confirms the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis. Granulomas can be seen on biopsy in a variety of diseases including, but not limited to, mycobacterial infections (Cryptococcosis, Coccidiomycosis, Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis), Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, Berylliosis and Rheumatoid Arthritis (TB and non-tuberculous mycobacteria), infection fungal A key feature of the granulomas that distinguishes between mycobacterial and fungal causes of granuloma formation on the one hand and those seen in Sarcoidosis on the other, is the presence of caseating necrosis. An example a caseating granuloma is shown in the figure below. Caseating granulomas are seen in mycobacterial and fungal disease, although these processes can also cause non-caseating granulomas. The presence of caseating necrosis, however, rules out the diagnosis of Sarcoidosis, which is only associated with non-caseating granulomas. the differential diagnosis Non-caseating granulomas can also be seen in Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis, but they tend to be less well-formed compared to those seen in Sarcoidosis, a distinction for which you will not be held responsible in this class. Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis should always be considered on for patients who present with restrictive pathophysiology and opacities on chest imaging. This patient lacked an exposure history that might be compatible with this diagnosis. The lymphadenopathy seen on her chest imaging is also not typical for Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and is, instead, more consistent with Sarcoidosis. Berylliosis often resembles Sarcoidosis but this patient lacked the occupational risk factors associated with this diagnosis (e.g., work in the nuclear materials industry, electronics manufacturing etc.). CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 9 \\n Case 2 (continued) 5. Should she be started on treatment? If so, what treatment would you use? In general, the time course and progression of Sarcoidosis varies a lot between patients and not every patient warrants treatment. For example, those patients who present with asymptomatic bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy are not treated because this problem typically resolves spontaneously without intervention. Patients who present with Lofgren\\'s Syndrome (fever, arthralgias, erythema nodosum and bilateral hilar adenopathy) are not treated for the same reason. In general, treatment is indicated for the following situations: Worsening pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea, cough, chest pain, hemoptysis) Objective evidence of worsening pulmonary function Progressive radiographic changes (increasing interstitial opacities, progression of fibrosis) Extrapulmonary disease with the exception of Lofgren\\'s Syndrome. This can include but is not limited to eye disease (anterior uveitis), cardiac disease (conduction abnormalities, restrictive cardiomyopathy) or central nervous system disease. Extrapulmonary involvement is a common phenomenon in Sarcoidosis and, as a result, patients newly diagnosed with this problem should also have workup for other problems, including uveitis (ophthalmologic exam), cardiac sarcoid (ECG, echocardiogram), and renal disease (serum creatinine, urinalysis). The patient in this case has significant interstitial opacities and markedly impaired pulmonary function. Her ECG also shows evidence of likely cardiac involvement (bradycardia, Type I AV Block). For these reasons she warrants initiation of treatment which, in his case, would begin with systemic corticosteroids. 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 3 A 51 year-old man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is evaluated in Pulmonary Clinic for reassessment of his respiratory function. He was diagnosed with ALS 1.5 years ago and has recently had a significant decline in his ability to ambulate and use his upper extremities. His wife notes that he has also been more tired and confused in the mornings than he had been previously and takes longer to \"get going\" each day. On exam, he has trouble rising from a seated position and his diaphragmatic excursion is decreased on percussion of the chest. He has no crackles or wheezes, his cardiac exam is normal and he has no lower extremity edema. The respiratory therapist performs several additional tests in clinic including the following: Spirometry: Predicted Measured % Predicted Parameter FEV1 (L) FVC (L) FEV1/FVC 3.35 4.02 0.83 1.78 2.10 0.84 53 52 - End-tidal PCO2: 50 mm Hg Peak Cough Flow: 230 L/min (Normal: > 500 L/min) 1) What would you expect to find if you ordered a chest radiograph on this patient? Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neuromuscular disease associated with diffuse muscle weakness. Such diseases are typically associated with restrictive pathophysiology. Spirometry does demonstrate a pattern consistent with restriction - a low FEV1 and FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio - but lung volume measurements, in particular a low TLC, are necessary to confirm this diagnosis. In restrictive processes, chest radiographs often demonstrate low lung volumes. This finding would be expected in a diffuse neuromuscular process like ALS, as involvement of the inspiratory muscles would limit the ability of the patient to take a deep breath at the time of the chest radiograph. Due to their inability to take deep breaths on inhalation, many ALS patients also develop atelectasis, which may manifest on chest radiographs as linear opacities in the basilar lung zones. 2) If you were to send him to the Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory for additional testing, what would you expect to find with each of the following parameters and why would you expect those results (predict the general trends - low, normal, high - rather than specific values)? TLC: Because ALS is associated with restrictive pathophysiology due to diffuse neuromuscular weakness, the total lung capacity is often reduced. As noted above, pattern of results seen on spirometry is consistent with restriction but demonstration of the low TLC is necessary to confirm the presence of restriction. Studies looking at pulmonary function test results in patients with ALS have shown a reduced TLC is not a universal finding, however, as some patients, particularly early in the disease, may have a TLC in the normal range. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 11 \\nCase 3 (continued) RV: Unlike in parenchymal diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, where residual volume is typically low, RV is increased in diffuse neuromuscular diseases like ALS because the patient lacks the expiratory muscle strength necessary to exhale to a low lung volume. 12 DLCO: The DLCO provides an assessment of the surface area for gas exchange. ALS affects the muscles of respiration but does not affect the lung parenchyma. As a result, the surface area for gas exchange and the DLCO are generally unaffected. 3) Peak cough flow measurement is similar to measurement of peak expiratory flow during spirometry. The peak flow rate is measured during a voluntary cough. How do you account for the observations on this patient\\'s peak cough flow measurements? There are three requirements for effective cough and secretion clearance: Inspiratory muscle strength to inhale to a high lung volume, which stretches expiratory muscles to their optimal length, increases lung recoil and stretches open the airways in preparation for the expiratory phase. Expiratory muscle strength to generate compressive forces and create an effective driving pressure for airflow during the expiratory phase. Glottic closure: In the absence of glottis closure, expiratory muscle contraction does not cause a sufficient rise in alveolar and airway pressure, thereby limiting driving pressure and decreasing flow during the expiratory phase. If the glottis closes adequately, however, expiratory muscle contraction and lung recoil lead to a large rise in alveolar and airway pressure. When the glottis finally opens, there is a very large pressure gradient between the alveolus and mouth, which promotes flow during the expiratory phase of the cough. This patient\\'s peak cough flow is markedly reduced (< 50% of normal). Because ALS is a diffuse neuromuscular disease, affecting inspiratory and expiratory muscle groups, he lacks the muscular wherewithal to both inhale to a high volume and forcibly exhale. With two of the three elements of effective cough impaired, he cannot generate sufficient flow during the expiratory phase. This will limit secretion clearance and predispose to infection. Some ALS patients also develop weakness in the bulbar muscles that control glottic function, further impairing their ability to cough effectively. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) When peak cough flow is reduced to this extent, ALS patients are generally started on a series of interventions to augment their cough. The most commonly used tool is a device known as the mechanical insufflator-exsufflator (MIE), which augments both the inspiratory and expiratory phases by affecting airway pressure in each phase. Some patients learn a technique known as glossopharyngeal breathing to increase lung volumes beyond what they can achieve with a single inhalation. Others use on-demand ventilators with a mouthpiece (referred to as \"sip ventilators\") to augment inspiratory volumes. By \"sipping\" on a mouthpiece attached to the ventilator, they trigger a ventilator-delivered breath that is larger than the inspiratory volume than they can achieve on their own. You do not need to know the specifics of these particular interventions and instead only need to know that when cough is impaired to this extent, these patients require interventions to augment cough to prevent infectious complications. 4) The end-tidal PCO2 denotes the partial pressure of carbon dioxide measured at the nostrils at the end of resting exhalation. It is used as a surrogate for the alveolar PCO2. What information does this provide us about his respiratory system function? Because it can be difficult, as well as painful, to draw arterial blood gases in the clinic, end- tidal PCO2 measurements are often used instead. When properly measured, the end-tidal PCO2 provides an estimate of the alveolar PCO2, which you recall from earlier in the course, is essentially the same as the arterial PCO2. The fact that the end-tidal PCO2 is increased, therefore, is a marker that the patient has an increased arterial PCO2 and is unable to maintain alveolar ventilation at a level sufficient to eliminate all of the CO2 produced by his metabolic activity. His inability to maintain sufficient alveolar ventilation is the result of his neuromuscular weakness, which leads to low tidal volumes. The usual response to low tidal volumes is to breath at a higher respiratory rate but because of his neuromuscular weakness it is difficult to sustain the required high rates. Another factor that plays a role is the dead-space fraction. Because the volume of the anatomic dead space is relatively fixed, breathing at lower tidal volumes increases the dead space fraction. Maintaining a normal PaCO2 in the face of a higher dead space fraction requires an increase in minute ventilation but a sufficiently weak patient with ALS is often unable to achieve and sustain this increased minute ventilation due to their neuromuscular disease. Another major contributor to the hypercarbia that develops in patients with ALS is nocturnal hypoventilation (i.e., during sleep). As a result, they wake up with in the morning with elevated PaCO2, which affects their ventilatory control through the remainder of the day. The detailed mechanism for this is beyond the scope of this course. 5) With the evolution of his disease, what further issues will this patient encounter? ALS patients face several important physiologic challenges. As their weakness worsens, they develop progressive hypoventilation, which leads to fatigue and mental status changes and contributes to the development of hypoxemia. Breathing at low tidal volumes also leads to atelectasis, which worsens ventilation-perfusion matching and causes further hypoxemia. At some point hypoventilation is severe enough to either require mechanical ventilatory support or cause their death. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 13 \\nCase 3 (continued) Even before they reach such a severe level of hypoventilation, patients are at risk for complications related to their poor cough function. Impaired secretion clearance predisposes to mucous plugging and atelectasis and, more importantly, an increased risk of respiratory infections. The latter are a common cause of mortality in ALS and other neuromuscular diseases. If patients develop weakness in the bulbar muscles that control glottic function and the laryngeal closure reflex, they are at increased risk for aspiration, which can also predispose to severe infection. 14 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 4 A 48 year-old woman presents complaining of dyspnea on exertion over a several month period.

The heart size is normal. The right heart border is clearly seen while the left heart border is a little more indistinct. The left and right hemidiaphragms are rounded. The left hemidiaphragm is not well visualized along its medial portion. The costophrenic angles are sharp bilaterally. There are some mild opacities at the bases (left > right), which may be related to atelectasis from the low lung volumes. 2) How would you interpret the pulmonary function tests? The FEV1 and FVC are both reduced but the FEV1/FVC ratio is normal. The TLC is reduced, indicating that the patient has a restrictive defect. The DLCO is normal indicating that the restrictive pathophysiology is the result of an extraparenchymal process, such as a neuromuscular disorder. The RV is also normal, providing further evidence that the restrictive defect is related to an extraparenchymal process (Compare to Case 1). Additional pulmonary function testing maneuvers are performed including spirometry in the supine position and maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures (MIP, MEP). The results are as follows: Parameter FVC (L) FEV1 (L) FEV1/FVC Upright 1.50 1.22 0.81 Parameter MIP (cm H2O) MEP (cm H2O) Predicted - 115 105 Supine 1.03 0.90 0.87 Actual - 50 101 % Change - 31 - 26 N/A % Predicted 43 96 3) What do these additional pulmonary function tests suggest about the cause of this patient\\'s dyspnea? How do the maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures compare to what you would expect to see in the previous case? There is a significant decrease in both the FEV1 and FVC when the patient assumes the supine position. Her maximum inspiratory pressure is markedly decreased while the maximum expiratory pressure is normal. This suggests that whatever underlying disease process she has is affecting inspiratory muscles alone and not her expiratory musculature. The pattern seen here with decrease in the FEV1 and FVC in the supine position and decrease in maximum inspiratory pressures is characteristic of diaphragmatic paralysis. The pattern seen with the MIP and MEP is different than what you would see with patients like the one in the previous case. When patients have a diffuse neuromuscular disease, the inspiratory and expiratory muscles are affected and, as a result, both the MIP and MEP are decreased. The decrease in her FEV1 and FVC in the supine position fits with her description of orthopnea, dyspnea that is worse in the supine position. While we commonly associate this 16 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 4 (continued) symptom with heart failure, it can also be seen in patients with very high BMI, severe asthma and diaphragmatic paralysis. If you suspect unilateral diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis, the most appropriate test is a \"sniff test.\" Fluoroscopy is used to visualize the diaphragms when the patient inhales briskly (i.e., sniffs). If the patient has unilateral paralysis, the diaphragms move in opposite directions, with the normal diaphragm descending and the paralyzed one moving up into the chest in response to the negative intrathoracic pressure. An example of this test is provided on the course website. The sniff test is not useful in bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis because the right and left diaphragms move in the same direction. For suspected bilateral paralysis, the most appropriate study is electromyography (EMG) of the diaphragm. Ultrasound can also be used to evaluate diaphragm function. 4) Suppose you were caring for a patient with a history of complete spinal cord injury at the C6-C7 level. How would their response to laying supine compare to the patient in this case? Patients with bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis tend to do worse in the supine position. With assumption of this position, the abdominal contents move up towards the diaphragm and chest. When the person tries to inhale, the weakened/paralyzed diaphragm cannot push these contents back into the abdomen. Diaphragm descent is necessary for chest expansion on inhalation. If chest expansion is inadequate, pleural and alveolar pressure will not drop sufficiently on inhalation (remember Boyle\\'s Law) and the patient cannot generate sufficient inspiratory airflow. Patients with spinal cord injuries below the level of C5 have intact diaphragmatic function (the diaphragm is innervated by C3, C4 and C5) and can breathe spontaneously. In contrast to the patient with diaphragmatic paralysis, they will be more dyspneic in the upright position CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers 17 \\nCase 4 (continued) rather than the supine position. Even though their diaphragms work, they have weak or paralyzed intercostal muscles and abdominal musculature. Abdominal muscle tone is necessary for normal diaphragm function. When a normal person is upright, the normal abdominal musculature provides tone that keeps the abdominal contents in place. This allows the diaphragm to remain in a rounded shape at rest and, as a result, contract with maximum force. Patients with spinal cord injury lack tone in their abdominal muscles. When they are in the upright position, the abdominal contents tend to sag down and outward. This causes the diaphragm to flatten out, a shape associated with diminished contractile strength (A similar problem is seen in patients with very large ventral hernias). These patients do okay in the supine position because gravity keeps the contents in place and the diaphragm is still capable of contracting and moving these contents away from the chest. You will also recall that a key aspect of diaphragm function is that when the diaphragm descends, intraabdominal pressure increases and this pushes the ribs up and outward, increasing the volume of the thorax. The increase in intraabdominal pressure requires tone in the abdominal wall musculature. If, however, abdominal muscle tone is lost due to the spinal cord injury, when the diaphragm descends on inhalation, the abdominal wall tends to \"pooch\" or sag outwards. Abdominal pressure does not increase as much and the ribs are not pushed up and out to the same degree. The problems described here with upright positioning are the reason these patients wear abdominal binders when upright - to replace the tone lost by the abdominal musculature. Optional Material on Immersion Dyspnea: Note: You will not be responsible for this specific phenomenon of immersion dyspnea on the exams in this course. It is included here because it further illustrates the principles of diaphragm function and respiratory system mechanics. 18 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 6 Answers \\nCase 4 (continued) In the case description, it was noted that the patient had more dyspnea when she was in the water. There are two primary reasons for this phenomenon. The first reason is that the water exerts pressure against the abdominal wall. This tends to force the abdominal contents inward and impairs the ability of the diaphragm to descend on inhalation. The second reason is that the water also exerts pressure on the chest wall. This causes a greater load against which the breathing muscles have to work. In the face of this increased load, the individual needs to achieve a greater change in pressure to achieve the same change in volume. However, because the diaphragm is weak and its function is further impaired by the inward pressure exerted by the water, the individual cannot generate sufficient negative inspiratory pressure, leading to insufficient tidal volumes and possibly hypoventilation. Stimulation of proprioceptive receptors in the muscles at lower lung volumes leads to shortness of breath even before a rise PaCO2, which will further increase dyspnea. The inward movement of her abdominal wall with inspiration can be explained by referring back to normal diaphragm function. Normally, when you inhale, the diaphragm descends, intraabdominal pressure increases and the abdominal wall moves outward. In her case, her diaphragm no longer descends adequately on inhalation. Instead, when she generates negative intrathoracic pressure through use of accessory muscles of respiration, the diaphragm is pulled upward into the chest, abdominal pressure drops and the abdominal wall moves inward.

He reports no angina and has no history of syncope. The 12-lead ECG is shown below. Question 1 What is the rate in this ECG? Is the rhythm regular or irregular? Are the QRS complexes wide or narrow? The HR, approximated best by counting QRS, complexes is 120 bpm. The rhythm is irregular and the QRS complexes are narrow (<120 msec).  5-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 What is the differential diagnosis? To form a differential diagnosis, the key is to first identify that this is a rapid, irregular, narrow complex tachycardia (Table 4, ECG Syllabus Part 2). That should immediately raise the possibility of atrial fibrillation, especially in an elderly patient with comorbidities. The next step is to look for true P waves, in all leads. It can be tricky when the baseline is coarse, which can mimic P waves and atrial flutter. The lack of consistent discrete P waves narrows it down to atrial fibrillation. Other possibilities are atrial flutter with variable conduction and less likely multifocal atrial tachycardia (a rarer condition). This ECG is most consistent with atrial fibrillation. Question 3 Distinguish between the two leading items on the differential using their respective mechanisms. Atrial fibrillation is characterized by multiple wavelets of current. These fibrillatory waves from the atria bombard the AV node, resulting in conduction to the ventricles in a random, unpredictable way, resulting in an \"irregular\" rate. Atrial flutter is caused by the current traveling in a circuitous path. There is more atrial activation given the stable circuit, usually around the tricuspid annulus, which rotates at ~300/min, producing flutter waves (\"saw-tooth\" waves). Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation. They are often both present in the same patient (although not usually on the same ECG). However, the ventricular response to atrial flutter is more often regular because the atrial flutter circuit is constant. Even with variable AV conduction, the atrial flutter circuit remains stable so that the variable RR intervals are identical (i.e., there will be periods of 150, 100, 75 bpm, etc). Question 4 What treatment would you recommend? Along with control of etiologies (such as hyperthyroidism, fever, etc), treatment of atrial fibrillation includes: 1. Rate control using beta-blockers (ie metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (ie diltiazem) is first-line treatment. Rhythm control (ie amiodarone, dronedarone) is second- line treatment. 2. This patient\\'s CHA2DS2-VASc score (Syllabus Table 10-4) is 4 (advanced age, diabetes, and hypertension), indicating that his risk of stroke is high enough that he should be on anticoagulation therapy. 2  5-Answers \\nExercise 2 For each of the Lead II rhythm strips shown below, determine the diagnosis. For each arrhythmia, explain where the conduction system fails, the potential cause, and treatment. Rhythm 1: Rhythm 2: 2nd degree AV block, type 1 (termed Mobitz I, or AV Wenckebach). There is a progressive PR lengthening before the \"dropped\" QRS complex. Vagally or drug mediated, and can also be transiently seen after an inferior MI.Rhythm 1 Diagnosis: Conduction: Mobitz I is usually due block in the AV node (ie intranodal) Causes: Treatment: Often benign, no treatment needed. Rhythm 2: Diagnosis: Conduction: Mobitz II indicates block below the AV node (infranodal, or infra-His) Causes: Treatment: While rare, can be seen after an anterior MI, with infiltrative cardiomyopathy, and advanced age. A much more ominous prognosis. A pacemaker is almost always required. 2nd degree AV block, type 2 (Mobitz II). The rhythm strip shows sinus rhythm with abruptly \"dropped\" P-QRS\\'s. without appreciable PR prolongation beforehand.  5-Answers 3 \\nExercise 3 A 75 year-old patient presents to the Emergency Department after an episode of syncope. They report feeling lightheaded for several weeks. The episodes occur daily and are not associated with any particular activity. This morning, while folding laundry, they felt dizzy and nearly fell but did not lose consciousness. A friend checked their pulse and it was 35 bpm. On exam, the patient appears fatigued, blood pressure is 148/87 mm Hg. On the ECG: Question 1 Describe the rate, rhythm, and QRS complexes in this ECG.The HR is approximately 36 bpm (6 QRS complexes x 6), rhythm is regular, and the QRS complexes are wide (suggesting a conduction abnormality below the AV node). Question 2 What is the diagnosis and what treatment would you recommend? This is 3rd degree AV block (complete heart block). It is characterized by: 1. Slow, regular bradycardia. This is an escape rhythm that is junctional (meaning at the AV node or below). 2. The atrial rate is greater than the ventricular rate 3. AV dissociation (the ventricles beat independently from the atria) There are multiple other abnormalities, which is often the case with complete heart block, including axis deviation (left axis in this case) Recommended therapy is a pacemaker. 4  5-Answers \\nExercise 4 An 83 year-old female with a history of diabetes presents with fatigue and occasional episodes of lightheadedness. For the past few months, she has had low energy, even to walk her dog. She regularly wears a heart rate monitor when exercising. When walking yesterday, she noted that the monitor was unable to detect her heart rate. Pulse rate at the time was 50 bpm. You perform an ECG: Question 1 What is the rate and rhythm in this ECG? What is the diagnosis? The HR is approximately 40 bpm and rhythm is regular. This is atrial flutter. Question 2 What treatment would you recommend? As with atrial fibrillation, we consider rate-control and anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis for treatment of atrial flutter. Given her CHA2DS2-VASc points for age, sex, and diabetes, anticoagulation is indicated. Rate-control is not appropriate for this patient because she is bradycardic. Although atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are often associated with a rapid ventricular response, sometimes the heart rate can be normal, or even slow as in this case. Therefore, adding a beta blocker or calcium channel blocker is not necessary. Note, with this slow atrial flutter that is causing symptoms, the patient should also be evaluated for a pacemaker. A 30-day monitor can be helpful in this decision by providing a longer view of the overall rate.  5-Answers 5 \\nExercise 5 A 42 year-old patient presents to the Emergency Department with palpitations for the past 2 hours. They have had many episodes of palpitations over the past 20 years, usually lasting 15 minutes. Their pulse has been as high as 200 bpm during these episodes, and they are often able to terminate the episodes by coughing. Today, however, the palpitations are persistent. On examination, the patient appears anxious, BP is 120/79 mm Hg, and RR is 18 per min. Their ECG is shown below. Question 1 Describe the rate, rhythm, and QRS complexes in this ECG.This is a regular, narrow complex tachycardia, with a rate of 156 bpm (26 QRS complexes x 6). Question 2 What is the differential diagnosis and the most likely diagnoses? See Table 4, ECG Syllabus Part 2. Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction often has a rate of 150 bpm. However, because there no clear P waves, atrial flutter, sinus tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia are unlikely. The most likely diagnosis is AVNRT or AVRT (we are unable to determine which one here). Tachycardia in a young-middle aged person at this rate is often due to AVNRT.If the patient\\'s resting ECG showed a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern of pre-excitation (delta wave), then this is more likely to be AVRT.6  5-Answers \\nQuestion 3 How would you treat this tachyarrhythmia, both in the short-term and long-term? In the short-term, with a stable blood pressure, the preferred initial therapy is a vagal maneuver (ie Valsalva maneuver, carotid sinus massage). IV adenosine will terminate the rhythm if it is due to AVNRT or AVRT.Alternatively, if atrial flutter is the cause, then adenosine can slow the ventricular rate such that flutter waves become apparent. In the long long-term, AV nodal blocking agents such as beta-blockers (ie metoprolol) or calcium channel blockers (ie diltiazem) are often effective. If the arrhythmia is poorly controlled despite medications, invasive modification of the AV node can be performed (slow-pathway ablation). Question 4 Antiarrhythmic drugs are used for arrhythmias that stem from specific locations in the heart. Complete the table below using the prototype drugs from your Arrhythmias Drug List. Arrhythmia Drug 1. Digoxin 2. Flecanide Atrial 3. Metoprolol AV Node Ventricular Atrial and Ventricular 4. Dofetilide 5. Verapamil 1. Adenosine 1. Lidocaine 1. Procainamide 2. Amiodarone 3. Dronedarone 4. Sotalol  5-Answers 7 \\nExercise 6 A 65 year-old patient with a history of coronary artery bypass graft in 2003 presents to the Emergency Department with palpitations. Their blood pressure is 70/48 mm Hg on arrival, and they faint shortly after this 12-lead ECG is obtained: Question 1 Describe the rate, rhythm, QRS complex, and axis. The rate is approximately 250 bpm, and the rhythm is a regular, wide-complex tachycardia with right axis deviation. Question 2 What is the differential diagnosis and the diagnosis? The diagnosis of a rapid, wide-complex tachycardia is ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise. This is because this rhythm is unstable and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation. For this reason, it is important to recognize ventricular tachycardia early. The differential includes a supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction (a wide complex QRS at baseline conducting at a rate >100 bpm, such as sinus tachycardia with an underlying bundle branch block). Question 3 What clinical and ECG features support your diagnosis? What treatment would you recommend? The presence of hemodynamic instability does NOT cinch the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (supraventricular tachycardia can manifest with low BP). However, the history of prior CABG and coronary disease makes VT more likely (often due to infarction and ventricular scarring). Furthermore, this ECG has precordial concordance, where all the QRS vectors in the precordial leads go in the same direction, a key feature of VT.Differentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy is challenging and should not be the focus of your efforts in this situation - this patient is unstable and you will never be faulted for performing urgent cardioversion (treatment). Note, if the patient were stable, an antiarrhythmic such as lidocaine or amiodarone is appropriate. 8  5-Answers \\nExercise 7: Some forms of narrow and wide complex tachycardia can be predicted based on the baseline ECG.For each baseline ECG shown below (A, B, and C), determine which of the tachycardias shown at the bottom (1, 2, or 3) you would expect to see in these cases: ECG A ECG B ECG C  5-Answers 9 \\nTachycardia 1 Tachycardia 2 Tachycardia 3 ECG A is WPW pattern, associated with Tachycardia 2, which is AVRT, a narrow-complex tachycardia which is mediated through a bypass tract. ECG B shows a long QT interval, which is the substrate for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (torsades de pointes), shown in Tachycardia 1. ECG C shows Q waves inferiorly, suggestive of an old inferior infarction (you will learn this later in the course). This is associated with Tachycardia 3, which is a wide-complex tachycardia suspicious for monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. Ischemia and old infarction (ie scaring of the myocardium) are substrates for VT.10  5-Answers \\n Pharynx and Larynx INTRODUCTION For the pulmonary portion of this block, we will follow the airway into the lungs. We thoroughly covered the nasal cavity in Invaders & Defenders so we will begin with the pharynx, which was previously introduced in the context of Waldeyer\\'s tonsillar ring. The airway continues from pharynx, to larynx, trachea, and the rest of the bronchopulmonary tree into the lungs (Figure 1). This chapter is divided into Pharynx and Larynx sub-chapters. The Pleural Spaces and Lungs are presented in the following syllabus. Figure 1. Overview of the airway PHARYNX LEARNING OBJECTIVES Identify the major structures of the pharynx. 1. 2. Explain the division of the pharynx into nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharynx and identify the anatomical contents in each. Identify the muscles contributing to the layers of the pharyngeal wall. 3. 4. Explain the nerve supply to the pharynx. 5. Explain the role of the pharynx and associated structures in swallowing and respiration. 6. Explain the functional and clinical significance of cervical fascial planes and compartments; name the layers of deep cervical fascia and describe their relationships to the viscera of the neck. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 1 \\nOVERVIEW OF THE PHARYNX The pharynx is a tube in the head and neck that acts as a passageway for both air and food. It is open to the nose, oral cavity, and larynx before opening into the esophagus inferiorly (Figure 2). These openings divide the pharynx into nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngopharyx (or hypopharynx), respectively. We highlighted the protective role of the lymphoid tissue in the pharynx during I&D.The pharynx also prevents food boluses from entering the nasal cavity and the larynx during swallowing and has sensory innervation that elicits gag reflexes to prevent unintentional ingestion or inhalation of material. Figure 2. Overview of the pharynx. Inset shows divisions of the pharynx-naso- (blue), oro- (pink), and laryngopharynx (green)-with airway (blue arrow) and GI tract (orange arrow). DIVISIONS OF THE PHARYNX NASOPHARYNX The nasopharynx is the portion of the pharynx posterior to the nasal cavity. It begins near the base of the skull and ends inferiorly at the soft palate. The nasopharynx communicates with the nasal cavity via the choanae (or posterior nasal apertures), the posterior openings on either side of the nasal septum. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 2 \\nRecall from I&D that the opening of the Eustachian (pharyngotympanic) tube is on the lateral wall of the nasopharynx (Figure 3). The torus tubarius forms a curved ridge over the opening of the Eustachian tube. The salpingopharyngeal fold over the small salpingopharyngeus muscle extends inferiorly from the torus tubarius. The pharyngeal recess is a deep pocket posterior to the torus tubarius where nasopharyngeal carcinomas may form. Figure 3. Nasopharynx The Eustachian tube can be opened to equilibrate pressure in the tympanic cavity by contracting the levator and tensor veli palatini, which originate from the cartilage of the tube (Figure 4). The levator veli palatini forms the floor of the pharyngotympanic tube near its opening. In the nasopharynx, it is seen as the levator cushion (anatomically known as the torus levatorius), the mucosal ridge that appears to flow out of the Eustachian tube. The muscle belly of the tensor veli palatini is anterior to the opening. Its tendon wraps around the pterygoid hamulus before inserting into the palatine aponeurosis. In addition to opening the Eustachian tube, these muscles elevate and tense soft palate-as their names suggest- in order to seal off the nasal cavity during swallowing. This dual action explains the connection between swallowing and \"popping your ears.\" Figure 4. Muscles in the lateral wall of the nasopharynx Recall from I&D the portions of Waldeyer\\'s tonsillar ring that are in the nasopharynx. The adenoids (pharyngeal tonsil) reside along the midline at the roof of the nasopharynx. When enlarged, they may block the airway at the choanae. The tubal tonsil resides in the mucosa over the torus tubarius and extends into the salpingopharyngeal fold. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 3 \\nOROPHARYNX Recall that the oropharynx is continuous with the nasopharynx at the soft palate and extends down to the epiglottis. The oropharynx communicates with the oral cavity via the isthmus of the (oral) fauces (Figure 5). The fauces can be thought of as a tunnel defined by the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. These arches are formed by the palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus muscles, respectively, along with the overlying mucosa. Recall from I&D the portions of Waldeyer\\'s ring in the oropharynx. The palatine tonsils- often referred to as the tonsils-lie in the tonsillar fossa between the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches (Figure 5). The lingual tonsil is the lymphatic tissue on the surface of the posterior 1/3 of the tongue known as the base of the tongue (Figure 2). LARYNGOPHARYNX The laryngopharynx is the portion of the pharynx posterior to the larynx. It is continuous with the oropharynx at the epiglottis and ends inferiorly at the lower margin of the cricoid cartilage, where the GI tract continues as the esophagus. The laryngopharynx communicates with the larynx anteriorly via the laryngeal inlet (Figure 6), which is formed by laryngeal cartilages covered in the next section of this chapter. The piriform recess is a deep pocket on either side of the anterior laryngopharynx at the level of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the larynx (Figure 6). These recesses are sites where food or other foreign objects may become trapped. Figure 5. Oropharynx from oral cavity Figure 6. Posterior view of the pharynx. Posterior wall cut sagittally and opened to view anterior communications. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 4 \\nTHE PHARYNGEAL WALL The pharyngeal wall comprises three circular constrictor muscles, three vertical muscles, two fascial layers, and an inner mucosa. The constrictor muscles-superior, middle, and inferior-make up the bulk of the pharyngeal wall (Figures 7 & 8). They are nested within one another like stacked flower pots such that the superior is the innermost and inferior is the outermost muscle. All of the constrictor muscles meet with fibers from the contralateral side along a midline pharyngeal raphe, where the individual constrictors are difficult to distinguish. They are easier to distinguish by their lateral attachments. The superior constrictor attaches to the base of the skull at the pharyngeal tubercle of the occipital bone. Laterally, it attaches to the pterygomandibular raphe. The middle constrictor attaches to the hyoid bone. The inferior constrictor attaches to the thyroid and cricoid cartilages of the larynx. The most inferior portion of the inferior constrictor arising from either side of the cricoid cartilage is called the cricopharyngeus. While there is significant overlap between the constrictor muscles near the midline raphe, there are four pharyngeal wall gaps along their lateral aspects (Figure 7). These four gaps-above the superior, on either side of the middle, and below the inferior-allow for the passage of structures into the pharynx and larynx (Table 1; see Figure 19). Figure 7. Pharyngeal constrictor muscles Gap, located between 1st gap, skull and superior constrictor 2nd gap, superior and middle constrictors 3rd gap, middle and inferior constrictors 4th gap, inferior constrictor (cricopharyngeus) and esophagus Table 1. Summary of pharyngeal wall gaps Major structures that pass through the gap Eustachian (pharyngotympanic) tube Stylopharyngeus, glossopharyngeal n Internal laryngeal n, superior laryngeal a/v Recurrent laryngeal n, inferior laryngeal a/v CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 5 \\nThe vertical muscles of the pharyngeal wall are the salpingopharyngeus, palatopharyngeus, and stylopharyngeus (Figure 8). We previously mentioned the salpingo- and palatopharyngeus muscles as being deep to their respective folds in the naso- and oropharynx. The stylopharyngeus originates on the styloid process outside of the pharynx and passes through the second gap-between the superior and middle constrictors-to attach to the pharyngeal wall. Figure 8. Muscles of the pharynx. Posterior view with intact (left) and opened constrictor muscles (right). The pharyngobasilar fascia lies deep to the constrictor muscles to provide a strong attachment to the skull and extra support to the pharyngeal wall, especially at the gaps between constrictor muscles (Figure 8). The buccopharyngeal fascia surrounds the constrictor muscles externally (see Figures 11 & 12). This layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia covered in the Triangles of the Neck syllabus. During swallowing, the skeletal muscles of the pharyngeal wall work in concert with muscles of the tongue, palate, and larynx to successfully pass a food bolus to the esophagus (and not back into the oral cavity, up into the nasal cavity, or down into the airway). While the initiation of swallowing is voluntary-consistent with the skeletal nature of these muscles-the rest of the action is a reflex that is coordinated in the brainstem. Put simply, as food is passed to the back of the oral cavity, the previously mentioned levator and tensor veli palatini elevate and tense the soft palate to close off the nasal cavity while the vertical muscles of the pharynx contract to shorten and widen the lumen. As the food bolus enters the oropharynx, the constrictor muscles contract in series to force it downward and the cricopharyngeus relaxes to allow it to pass into the esophagus. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 6 \\nNEUROVASCULATURE OF THE PHARYNX NERVES The pharynx is innervated by cranial nerves IX and X, which form the pharyngeal plexus on its posterior surface (Figure 9). CN IX provides most of the sensory innervation (the laryngopharynx receives sensory fibers from CN X). CN x provides all of the motor innervation of the pharyngeal wall except for the stylopharyngeus, which is innervated by CN IX.BLOOD VEssELS The blood supply of the pharynx arises from arteries that were covered in the previous Triangles of the Neck syllabus. The superior portion of the pharynx is supplied by the ascending pharyngeal artery from the ECA (with contributions from the lesser palatine artery that mainly supplies the soft palate; Figures 9 & 10). The inferior portion of the pharynx is supplied by branches of the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk off the 1st part of the subclavian a (see Figures 4 & 5 in Triangles of the Neck syllabus). Figure 9. Neurovasculature of the pharynx The palatine tonsils receive arterial blood from tonsillar branches that originate from multiple branches of the ECA, including the ascending pharyngeal artery (Figure 10). These anastomotic connections must be considered during tonsillectomy. The pharyngeal venous plexus of veins drains blood from the pharynx (including the palatine tonsils) into the IJV (Figure 9). Figure 10. Tonsillar branches from branches of the ECA CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 7 \\nFASCIAL SPACES AROUND THE PHARYNX We previously covered the fascial compartments of the neck that group muscles and other structures together for coordinated movements such as swallowing. Fascial compartments may isolate abscesses or tumors to a single space where the pathology may enlarge to the point of displacing or blocking nearby structures (see parapharyngeal abscess correlate below). Conversely, fascial planes may become routes for the spread of infection or metastasis of cancer (see \"danger space\" correlate below) and can be used as natural surgical planes. Here we will highlight some important spaces posterior to the pharynx. The parapharyngeal space is deep to the tonsillar fossa containing the tonsils (Figure 11). This space contains a lot of neurovasculature for the pharynx and other regions of the head, an important point to consider when performing a tonsillectomy. It is also immediately adjacent to a lot of other spaces in the head and neck, including the vascular space surrounded by the carotid sheath. Figure 11. Fascial spaces near the tonsils. Note that the retropharyngeal and the prevertebral \"danger\" spaces are two potential spaces between the buccopharyngeal and prevertebral fascial layers (shown in Figure 12). Clinical correlate: Infection of the palatine tonsils can result in the formation of a parapharyngeal abscess. A rapidly growing abscess confined to the parapharyngeal space may enlarge to the point of completely blocking the airway, leading to suffocation and death. The axial CT on the right shows a parapharyngeal abscess (yellow arrow) forcing the inflamed right tonsil to the left and narrowing the airway (for reference, the small dot in the middle of the radiolucent airway is the uvula). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 8 \\nThere are two potential spaces directly behind the pharynx, the retropharyngeal and prevertebral \"danger\" spaces (Figures 11 & 12). Recall that a potential space is not filled with anything under normal conditions but may be filled with fluid or air with certain pathologies. The retropharyngeal space is directly behind the pharynx between the buccopharyngeal fascia covering the pharyngeal constrictors and the extremely thin alar fascia (continuous with prevertebral fascia). This space extends from the base of the skull to the superior mediastinum near the thoracic inlet at T1. The prevertebral \"danger\" space lies between the alar fascia and the prevertebral fascia, extending from the base of the skull all the way down to the diaphragm. This space-a sub-compartment of the prevertebral space that is defined by the prevertebral fascia and contains the deep neck muscles-is commonly referred to as just the \"danger space.\" Figure 12. Fascial spaces posterior to the pharynx. Note that these are potential spaces, only visible when filled with fluid. Buccopharyngeal fascia = green dashes; prevertebral/alar fascia = magenta dashes. Clinical correlate: The prevertebral \"danger\" space (or just \"danger space\") is so-called because it provides a route for infection to spread from the head near the frequently exposed tonsils all the way to the important circulatory structures in the posterior mediastinum. The sagittal CT on the right shows a ruptured peritonsillar abscess that has begun to fill the retropharyngeal (white arrow) and danger spaces (black arrowhead) separated by the alar fascia, all of which are normally indistinguishable in radiographic images.

Identify the actions of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles during normal respiration, phonation, and forced respiration. Identify the vascular and nerve supply of the larynx. OVERVIEW OF THE LARYNX As described above, the laryngopharynx is open to the larynx through the laryngeal inlet. In addition to being part of the airway connecting the pharynx to the trachea, the larynx contains the vocal cords. The vocal cords vibrate as air is exhaled over them to produce sound during phonation, an important component of speech. The muscles of the larynx will tense or relax the vocal cords to produce varied pitch as well as adjust the size of the rima glottidis, the space between the vocal cords. LARYNGEAL SKELETON CARTILAGE The laryngeal skeleton is made up of four major cartilages: the unpaired thyroid, cricoid, and epiglottic cartilages and the paired arytenoid cartilages. These cartilages protect and maintain the airway, provide attachment points for the muscles and ligaments of the larynx, and articulate with one another as part of phonation and breathing. The thyroid cartilage (Greek for \"shield\") is the largest of these cartilages (Figures 13 & 14). It is shaped like a shield protecting the airway anteriorly with no posterior surface. The laryngeal prominence along the midline is commonly referred to as the \"Adam\\'s apple\" because it is larger in males. The broad lateral portions on either side are the laminae. The superior horn provides an attachment site for the thyrohyoid membrane. The inferior horn articulates with the cricoid cartilage below at the cricothyroid joints. The cricoid cartilage (Greek for \"ring\") is the only cartilage that completely encircles the airway (Figures 13-15). Its lamina faces posteriorly. The cricoid cartilage articulates with the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage and with the arytenoid cartilages above. Figure 13. Laryngeal skeleton, lateral view CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 11 \\nThe epiglottic cartilage is attached to the deep surface of the thyroid cartilage as the leaf-shaped core of the epiglottis-cartilage plus the overlying mucosa-near the base of the tongue (Figures 13 & 14). This cartilage is elastic (not hyaline like the others) so that the epiglottis can be drawn inferoposteriorly to divert ingested material around the laryngeal inlet during swallowing. The valleculae are bilateral depressions in the mucosa on the anterior surface of the epiglottis defined by the two lateral and one median glossoepiglottic folds. These \"little valleys\" may normally serve to collect saliva for a time to avoid constantly swallowing but may also be a place where foreign objects (like a popcorn kernel shell) can become trapped. The arytenoid cartilages (Greek for \"pitcher\") rest on the lamina of the cricoid cartilage at the cricoarytenoid joints (Figures 14 & 15). The vocal ligaments attach to the anterior vocal process. Some of the laryngeal muscles attach to the lateral muscular process. The apex extends superiorly. Figure 14. Laryngeal skeleton, posterior view. Joint actions indicated by red arrows. Inset shows anterior epiglottis viewed from oral cavity. The corniculate cartilages are small horn-shaped cartilages that rest on the apex of the arytenoid cartilages (Figure 14). SYNOVIAL JOINTS The cricothyroid joint is the articulation of the cricoid cartilage with the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage (Figure 13 & 14). This joint allows the thyroid cartilage to be tilted forward to stretch and stiffen the vocal cords in order to raise the pitch of the voice. The cricoarytenoid joint is the articulation of the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages (Figure 14). Contraction of the muscles that attach to the arytenoid cartilages can cause them to rotate or glide in order to widen or narrow the rima glottidis. These actions are further explained in the Intrinsic Muscles of the Larynx section below. MEMBRANES AND LIGAMENTS Broad sheets of dense connective tissue hold the cartilages together and help maintain the roughly tubular shape of the larynx. The thyrohyoid membrane connects the thyroid cartilage to the hyoid bone, providing additional support for the larynx (Figure 13). Anteriorly, the thyrohyoid membrane is covered by the infrahyoid muscles. Laterally, the thyrohyoid aperture provides a route for neurovasculature to enter the larynx. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 12 \\nClinical correlate: A cricothyrotomy (aka crike) is performed to make an emergency airway only when there is an immediate threat of suffocation and no other form of intubation is possible. The cricothyroid ligament (or membrane) connects the thyroid and cricoid cartilages (Figure 13). The conus elasticus is formed by the lateral portions of the cricothyroid membrane (Figure 15). Its superior border condenses as the vocal ligament that runs from the vocal process of the arytenoid cartilage to the angle of the thyroid cartilage. The mucosal membrane over the vocal ligament is the vocal fold, which is the true vocal cord that vibrates during phonation. Superior to the conus elasticus, the quadrangular membrane extends between the arytenoid and epiglottic cartilages. Its superior border (the aryepiglottic ligament) is covered by the aryepiglottic fold that contributes to the oval shape of the laryngeal inlet (Figure 16). The inferior border of the quadrangular membrane is the vestibular ligament that is covered by the vestibular fold, or the false vocal cord that is seen above the true vocal cord from a superior view as through a laryngoscope. Figure 15. Laryngeal skeleton, superior and mid-sagittal views. Note that the vocal ligament is the condensed superior border of the conus elasticus (labeled in the superior view; not shown in the mid-sagittal view). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 13 \\nFigure 16. Cavities of the larynx. Extent of the conus elasticus (magenta) and quadrangular membrane (green) deep to the mucosa shown in dashed lines in left image. The supraglottic cavity comprises the vestibule (blue) and ventricle (green) shown in right image. Using the folds that we have just identified, we can compartmentalize the larynx into separate cavities, which is helpful for describing the neurovasculature supply (see the Neurovasculature sub-section below). The rima glottidis is the space between the two vocal folds (intermembranous part) and two arytenoid cartilages (intercartilaginous part; Figure 15). The right and left vocal folds and the rima glottidis together form the glottis (Figure 16). The infraglottic cavity is the larynx beneath the glottis. The supraglottic cavity is the larynx above the glottis. The supraglottic cavity can be further divided into the vestibule, the region between the aryepiglottic and vestibular folds, and the ventricle, the pocket between the vestibular and vocal folds. INTRINSIC MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX The intrinsic muscles of the larynx act on the cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid joints to manipulate the glottis. They are named according to their attachment sites on the laryngeal cartilages. Two muscles are primarily responsible for adjusting the tension on the vocal cords: cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid (Figure 17). The cricothyroid is the only intrinsic muscle of the larynx that can be seen externally. Contraction of the cricothyroid tilts the thyroid cartilage forward, tensing the vocal cords and raising pitch. The thyroarytenoid spans the thyroid and arytenoid cartilages to pull the arytenoid cartilage anteriorly at the cricoarytenoid joint, relaxing the vocal cords and lowering pitch. The vocalis is the portion of the thyroarytenoid that attaches directly to the vocal ligaments to precisely modulate tension of the vocal cord. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 14 \\nThree muscles primarily adjust the size of the rima glottidis: posterior cricoarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, and transverse arytenoid (Figure 17). The posterior cricoarytenoid is the only muscle that abducts the vocal cords, widening the rima glottidis. By pulling posteriorly on the muscular process of the arytenoid, it moves the vocal process laterally as the arytenoid cartilage rotates at the cricoarytenoid joint. Conversely, the lateral cricoarytenoid adducts the vocal cords and narrows the rima glottidis by pulling anteriorly on the muscular process. The transverse arytenoid is an unpaired muscle that adducts the vocal cords by pulling the two arytenoid cartilages together, closing the intercartilaginous part of the rima glottidis.

Summary of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 15 \\nThe individual actions of these muscles combine to independently control the intermembranous and intercartilaginous parts of the rima glottidis for different functions (Table 2). During normal respiration, the vocal cords rest in a neutral position slightly apart from one another. The positions of the vocal cords during this and other actions are indicated in Figure 18. Note how air is being forced through the intercartilaginous part of the rima glottidis when whispering; this is separate from phonation, which requires air to be forced across closed vocal cords. Figure 18. Position of the vocal cords. Superior view as from an endoscope. Use the cartilages for orientation. The vestibular folds may also be brought together to close the airway during a Valsalva maneuver (not shown). The actions of the vocal cords during phonation are also shown in this stroboscopy video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfOZxJnY4c8. Anterior is at the bottom of the image when the vocal cords are in view. Note how the vocal cords vibrate at a frequency that is imperceptible to the naked eye until the strobe light is turned on to \"slow down\" the vibration by sampling the frames. As you watch the video, connect the larger actions that the patient is performing to the specific actions of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx and what the vocal cords are doing in response. NEUROVASCULATURE OF THE LARYNX NERVES All of the sensory and motor innervation of the larynx is from branches of CN X.These branches take different routes to the larynx and, therefore, may be damaged in isolation. The recurrent laryngeal nerve off CN x provides motor innervation to all of the intrinsic muscles of the larynx-except for the cricothyroid-and sensory innervation for the mucosa of the infraglottic cavity (Figure 19). Recall that the recurrent laryngeal nerve loops around the subclavian artery on the right and the arch of the aorta on the left. From there, it ascends in the tracheoesophageal groove before entering the laryngopharynx at the 4th gap in the pharyngeal wall inferior to the cricopharyngeus. Once in the laryngopharynx, it travels deep to the mucosa in the piriform recess to its targets. [This terminal portion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is sometimes referred to as the inferior laryngeal nerve.] Clinical correlate: Unilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (eg surgical transection or compression) will paralyze the ipsilateral intrinsic muscles of the larynx. The vocal cord on that side will not be able to move from its neutral position during normal respiration. The primary symptom is a hoarse and weak voice that makes it difficult to speak (dysphonia). Other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and difficulty breathing (dyspnea) may also present. The following link shows both the presentation and paralysis of the vocal cord (left in this example): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqV7cRc2c6M.CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pharynx and Larynx 16 \\nThe superior laryngeal nerve off CN x branches into the internal and external laryngeal nerves (Figure 19). The internal laryngeal nerve pierces the thyrohyoid aperture at the 3rd gap in the pharyngeal wall to provide sensory innervation of the supraglottic cavity. Activation of these sensory fibers triggers a cough reflex to prevent material from traveling further down the airway. The external laryngeal nerve continues externally to innervate the cricothyroid. Clinical correlate: Isolated damage to the external laryngeal nerve will only paralyze the cricothyroid. This may reduce the ability to produce high-pitched sounds, which can go unnoticed by many patients. ARTERIES The inferior laryngeal artery branches off the inferior thyroid artery to pair with the recurrent laryngeal nerve in the infraglottic cavity (Figure 19). The superior laryngeal artery branches off the superior thyroid artery to pair with the internal laryngeal nerve in the supraglottic cavity.\\nList the four major cartilages of the laryngeal skeleton. Identify the two synovial joints of the laryngeal skeleton and describe the actions at each. Describe the vocal ligament versus the vocal fold. Describe the vestibular ligament versus the vestibular fold. How do these terms relate to the true and false vocal cords? Which muscles adjust the length of the vocal cords to control pitch? Which intrinsic laryngeal muscles act on the arytenoids to manipulate the size of the rima glottidis? Describe the position of the vocal folds with normal respiration, deep respiration, phonation, and whispering. Which cranial nerve is responsible for all of the innervation of the larynx? Describe the recurrent laryngeal nerve, internal laryngeal nerve, and external laryngeal nerve in terms of their sensory distribution and/or muscular targets.\\nOften, you will be given a patient presentation and your task will be to diagnose the patient before you can answer the question stem about the management of the disease. The following cases are intended to help you practice working through the diagnosis of a patient. The answer to each case is on the following page along with a brief explanation. Keep in mind that these descriptions are not the only way these cases will present, both on exams and in practice.\\nA 67 year-old with a history of coronary artery disease presents to urgent care with 7 days of shortness of breath since Thanksgiving. They report episodes of waking up intermittently at night feeling like they cannot breathe. These episodes are relieved when they sit up. Two days ago, the patient started sleeping more upright in their recliner because they are too short of breath to lay supine in bed. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 94 bpm, BP: 115/80 mm Hg, CV: O2 Sat 92% on ambient air, RR 32 breaths/min Regular rhythm and rate. No murmurs nor rubs. S3 gallop present. PMI at the midclavicular line. JVP 13 cm. 2+ upper and lower extremity pulses 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema to the knees Lungs: Diffuse rales. No wheezes nor rhonchi. Skin: Warm, no cyanosis Their chest radiograph is shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Acute Decompensated Biventricular Heart Failure The patient\\'s physical exam is consistent with volume overload. They have pulmonary edema from left sided heart failure as demonstrated by paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (awaking at night short of breath), orthopnea (by their preference of sleeping more upright in a recliner), rales on pulmonary exam, and a chest radiograph showing diffuse pulmonary edema. They also have signs of right sided heart failure as demonstrated by their elevated JVP and lower extremity edema. Thus, the patient has biventricular heart failure. Because they are volume overloaded, this is acute heart failure. Finally, the S3 gallop and normal PMI indicate systolic heart failure. This is consistent with their prior history of coronary artery diseases. Note that the patient is not in cardiogenic shock because there is no evidence of end organ dysfunction such as altered mental status, decreased urination, or cold and mottled extremities. \\nCase 2 A 10 year-old with no prior medical history presents with a lightheadedness and confusion. Yesterday they consumed undercooked beef at a restaurant. In the past 24 hours, they have had 20 episodes of diarrhea and 3 episodes of emesis. They have not been able to eat nor drink due to nausea and abdominal discomfort. This morning they felt dizzy when sitting up and appear confused. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 121, BP: 85/60, O2 Sat 98% on ambient air, RR 16 breaths/min HEENT: mucous membranes dry CV: Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. JVP is flat. PMI palpable and non-displaced. 1+ upper extremity pulses. Lungs: Clear to auscultation, no wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: Cold extremities \\nDiagnosis: Hypovolemic shock Although the cause of hypovolemic shock is most often due to hemorrhage (such as trauma, or internal bleeding), it can also be caused by other losses such as diarrhea, vomiting, or polyuria. This patient\\'s history and physical exam is consistent with hypovolemic shock. There is a history of volume loss in the setting of profuse diarrhea, emesis, and no oral intake to make up for these losses. On physical exam, vitals reflect this low volume with a low blood pressure and compensatory high heart rate. The jugular venous pressure is flat, meaning jugular venous pulsation is not apparent due to low pressure in the right atrium from decreased volume. Dry mucous membranes (ie lips and tongue) are also consistent with severe dehydration. The skin is cool due to low blood volume, resulting in less blood perfusion to the extremities despite increased systemic vascular resistance. \\nCase 3 A 73 year-old with a history of coronary artery diseases presents to their primary care provider with a two-week history of fatigue and intermittent palpitations. They report feeling that their heart is \"jumping,\" a sensation that comes and goes intermittently. Since this symptom began, they have been feeling more fatigued. When they feel their heart racing, they often concurrently feel lightheaded. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR irregular and 78bpm, BP: 115/76, O2 Sat 98% on ambient air, RR 16 breaths/min Irregular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. PMI palpable at the midclavicular line. No lower extremity edema. CV: Lungs: No increased work of breathing. Lungs clear to auscultation, no wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: Warm Their ECG tracing is as follows: \\nDiagnosis: Atrial fibrillation Atrial fibrillation can present in many ways, ranging from intermittent palpitations to symptoms of impaired perfusion such as lightheadedness, dizziness, fatigue, and dyspnea. Atrial fibrillation occurs when there is irregular conduction in the atrium (on EKG, seen as \"absent\" p-waves), which results in intermittent conduction through the AV node to the ventricles; as such, the ventricular rate is irregular without consistent pattern. This can be detected on physical exam with an irregular rhythm on cardiac auscultation or palpating pulses. The EKG findings in atrial fibrillation include absent p-waves and an irregular ventricular rate. \\nCase 4 A 72 year-old presents to primary care clinic with a 2-month history of increasing dyspnea on exertion. They last felt completely well one year ago when they could walk up to 2 miles in their neighborhood without symptoms. Since then, they have noticed a steady decline in their ability to exert themselves, feeling more out of breath with decreasing distances. In the past month, they can only walk 2 blocks before starting to feel short of breath and have recently began to concurrently experience mild chest pressure with exertion. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 72, BP: 115/70, O2 Sat 96% on ambient air, CV: RR 12 breaths/min Regular rate and rhythm. Normal S1 and S2. Systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the neck. 2+ upper extremity pulses. No lower extremity edema. Lungs: Breathing comfortably on room air. Clear to auscultation, no wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: Warm \\nDiagnosis: Aortic Stenosis (AS) This patient\\'s history and physical exam is consistent aortic stenosis. Early signs of aortic stenosis are dyspnea on exertion, decreased exercise tolerance, and exertional angina (as reflected by the mild chest pressure). Syncope is a downstream clinical consequence due to inadequate cardiac output as the stenosis increases in severity. On exam, the murmur is best auscultated at the aortic valve area (right upper sternal border) and radiates in the direction of flow to the carotid arteries. The character of this systolic murmur, increasing then decreasing, is consistent with flow gradually increasing through the valve in early systole. Notably, this patient does not have symptoms of syncope nor heart failure which are prognostic factors. Although an irregular rhythm is not appreciated on exam, atrial fibrillation should be considered if the patient experiences palpitations since this is another prognostic factor. \\nCase 5 A 14 year-old presents to their pediatrician for a physical exam required to participate in their school\\'s athletic teams. The patient was delivered at term, with no complications after birth. They have no prior medical history, and you see from their growth chart that they are on track for their age. On review of systems, the patient reports that they do not experience shortness of breath nor fatigue with exercise beyond normal. However, the patient intermittently feels their heart is racing. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 90 bpm, O2 Sat 99% on ambient air, RR 22 breaths/min CV: Right Upper Extremity blood pressure: 110/80 mm Hg, Left Upper Extremity blood pressure: 110/80 mm Hg 2+ upper and lower extremity pulses, Irregular rhythm, 2/6 blowing systolic murmur heard best at the LUSB.No rubs nor gallops, S2 does not vary with inspiration, JVP 6 cm, no lower extremity edema Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: Warm, no cyanosis Their ECG shows: \\nDiagnosis: Atrial Septal Defect The patient\\'s physical exam is consistent with an atrial septal defect. A systolic murmur at the LUSB could be an ASD or pulmonic stenosis, however, pulmonic stenosis is a crescendo- decrescendo murmur (similar to aortic stenosis), and this patient has a blowing murmur consistent with ASD.An S2 that does not vary with inspiration (meaning the aortic and pulmonic valves do not vary in their time to closing) is a called a \"fixed split S2.\" This finding indicates there is consistently excess volume in the right ventricle. In an ASD, this is the extra flow from the left atrium. Finally, if an ASD is left unrepaired, the right atrium will exhibit sequelae of volume overload. Specifically, right atrial dilation, which makes it prone to atrial fibrillation as demonstrated by the patient\\'s intermittent palpitations, irregular rhythm on exam, and ECG with no clear p waves. \\nCase 6 A 72 year-old presents with 2 months of intermittent chest pressure. Every day the patient walks up 3 flights of stairs to get to their apartment. However, over the past 2 months, they have been experiencing chest pressure by the third flight that is relieved when they sit down for a few minutes. The patient has a history of hypertension for which they take lisinopril daily, and a 30 pack-year smoking history, having successfully quit smoking 10 years ago. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 80 bpm, BP 120/70 mm Hg, O2 Sat 99% on ambient air, CV: RR 22 breaths/min Regular rhythm and rate. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. PMI at midclavicular line. JVP 7 cm. 2+ upper and lower extremity pulses. No lower extremity edema. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: Warm, no cyanosis Their resting ECG is normal. You order an ECG exercise stress test that lasts 6 minutes before they must stop after developing chest pressure. Lead II on an ECG at that time shows: \\nDiagnosis: Stable Angina This patient has symptoms of angina manifested as chest pressure with exertion. It is stable angina because it resolves with rest. If the angina continued despite rest, this would be unstable angina. An exercise stress test is used to confirm the diagnosis of stable angina, which is established here by the downward sloping ST segments captured after exercise. Downward or horizontal ST segment depressions indicate the presence of subendocardial ischemia. As for the cause of their stable angina, there is no murmur on exam that would indicate aortic valve disease. Thus, in the setting of their atherosclerosis risk factors (age, hypertension, history of smoking), their angina is most likely secondary to coronary atherosclerosis. \\nCase 7 A 68 year-old presents to the Emergency Department with two hours of nausea and light- headedness. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 60 bpm, BP 120/80 mm Hg, O2 Sat 98% on ambient air, CV: RR 22 breaths/min Regular rhythm and rate. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. PMI at midclavicular line. JVP 7 cm. 2+ upper and lower extremity pulses. No lower extremity edema. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Abd: Nondistended, no hepatomegaly Skin: Warm. Their ECG is shown below. A right-sided ECG is normal. Troponin-I is elevated. \\nDiagnosis: Inferior MI This patient has ST elevations in Leads II, III, and avF, and Q waves in leads III and avF.These abnormalities in the inferior leads are consistent with an inferior STEMI, most commonly due to occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The ST depression in lead avL is a reciprocal change. With an inferior myocardial infarction, there can be an associated right ventricular myocardial infarction since the right ventricle is also supplied by the RCA.However, because there is no ST elevation in V1, and he has a normal right sided normal ECG, there is no evidence of right ventricular infarction. Finally, the patient\\'s normal jugular venous pressure and clear lungs indicate that they are not in heart failure at this time. Additionally, their extremities are warm. and blood pressure is in a normal range. Thus, they do not have signs of cardiogenic shock. \\nCase 8 A 59 year-old with a history of diabetes presents to their primary care physician for an annual physical exam. When asked about exercise, the patient reports that they like to walk but are limited by progressively aching pain in their left thigh. This pain is relieved by standing still for a few minutes. The patient can then resume walking but finds that they must stop every 10 minutes to relieve the pain. The patient is a non-smoker and takes insulin daily. On review of systems, they report no pain at this time, nor at night when sleeping in bed, and no numbness nor tingling of their lower extremities. On exam: Vitals: Afebrile, HR 72 bpm, BP 118/72 mm Hg, O2 Sat 94% on ambient air, CV: RR 18 breaths/min Regular rhythm and rate. No murmurs nor rubs. S3 gallop. PMI at midclavicular line. JVP 6 cm. 2+ upper extremity pulses, 1+ lower extremity pulses. No lower extremity edema. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: No lower extremity ulcerations, pallor, nor dependent erythema. Warm. Neuro: 5/5 bilateral lower extremity strength and 4/5 left lower extremity sensation to pinprick. The patient\\'s ankle-brachial index is 0.8. \\nDiagnosis: Chronic Ischemia of Peripheral artery occlusive disease - Claudication There are two categories within chronic ischemia of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD): claudication and chronic limb threatening ischemia. This patient has symptoms of intermittent claudication as demonstrated by pain that is recurrent with a consistent level of exertion (walking 10 minutes), and is relieved by rest. This falls under Rutherford Class 1 (mild claudication). The patient does not exhibit signs of critical limb ischemia because they do not have rest pain, pallor of their extremities, nor cold extremities. Furthermore, they have lower extremity pulses, and their sensation and motor strength are present (ie no paresthesia nor paralysis). Finally, because the patient\\'s pain is in their left thigh, the affected arteries are the left external iliac and common femoral arteries (the location of claudication pain is distal to the affected artery). Note also that their history of diabetes is a risk factor for peripheral artery occlusive disease. \\nCase 9 A 32 year-old presents to the Emergency Department with chest pain that started 1 week ago after playing in the finals of a rugby tournament. They were previously in good health with no prior medical history nor medications. Today, the patient reports continuous chest pain that is sharp, worse with inspiration, and better when they lean forward. They report no dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain, nor bloating. On exam: Vitals: Temperature 37.9 C, HR 75 bpm, BP 130/90 mm Hg, O2 Sat 99% on ambient air, CV: RR 18 breaths/min Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. PMI at midclavicular line. JVP 6 cm. 2+ upper extremity pulses, no lower extremity edema. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. \\nDiagnosis: Acute Pericarditis This patient\\'s symptoms of chest pain that is worse with inspiration and better when leaning forward is consistent with pain caused from inflamed pericardium. Although a friction rub is associated for acute pericarditis, it is not always heard. The ECG is also consistent with acute pericarditis as seen by the diffuse ST segment elevations that are concave upward, along with PR depressions and no reciprocal ST depressions. If this were a STEMI, ST segments would be concave down. The cause of the patient\\'s acute pericarditis is likely due to trauma to the chest from blunt force, as might be incurred in contact sports. \\nCase 10 A 38 year-old presents to the Emergency Department after a motor vehicle accident. They were on the passenger side of the car where the airbag was deployed upon impact. On presentation, the patient reports light headedness. They report no changes in vision, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nor nausea. On exam: Vitals: Temperature 37 C, HR 160 bpm, BP 80/56 mm Hg, O2 Sat 99% on ambient air, RR 22 breaths/min CV: Distant heart sounds. Regular rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, nor gallops. Unable to palpate PMI.JVP 11 cm. 2+ upper extremity pulses that decrease with inspiration. No lower extremity edema. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, nor rales. Skin: No lacerations, ecchymoses across chest. Warm extremities. The patient\\'s ECG is shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Cardiac Tamponade Blunt trauma can cause cardiac tamponade. This patient has findings of hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, and muffled heart sounds (from fluid in the pericardial sac), which are classically found in tamponade. The amplitude of their pulse decreases with inspiration, which is consistent with pulsus paradoxus (an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure with inspiration). The ECG shows alternating QRS amplitudes, a sign known as \"electrical alternans.\" This sign is attributed to an alternating axis as the heart swings in the fluid filled pericardial sac. Note that the patient does not have chest pain, so this is not consistent with acute pericarditis. \\n Pericardium and Coronary Circulation LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1. 2. 3. Identify the layers of the pericardium - fibrous and serous. Identify the pericardial cavity and the transverse and oblique pericardial sinuses. Identify the great vessels and describe their spatial relationships to the heart, lungs, and diaphragm. Identify the right and left coronary arteries, their origins, and their branches. 4. Describe the relationships of the phrenic and vagus nerves to the root of the lung and the heart. 5. 6. Describe the difference between left and right dominance of the coronary arteries. 7. Identify the cardiac veins and coronary sinus. INTRODUCTION As we first covered in MCBD, the thorax can be divided broadly into the two pleural cavities and the mediastinum. The mediastinum itself can be further divided into four parts described below. In the cardiovascular portion of the CPR block, we will explore the contents of the mediastinum according to these divisions. OVERVIEW OF THE MEDIASTINUM The mediastinum is the thick band of tissue that sits in the middle of the thoracic cavity between the two pleural sacs (mediastinum from Latin for \"middle\"). It contains the heart, great vessels, trachea, esophagus, and other important nerves and vessels. The mediastinum is divided into superior and inferior mediastina by the thoracic plane, which passes through the sternal angle anteriorly and the intervertebral disc between the T4 and T5 vertebrae posteriorly (Figure 1). The inferior mediastinum is further divided into three parts: anterior, middle, and posterior. The middle mediastinum is defined by the pericardial sac. The anterior mediastinum and posterior mediastinum are the spaces anterior and posterior to the pericardial sac, respectively. The anterior mediastinum contains the thymus, which degenerates with age and will not be covered further within the HFF material. The superior and posterior mediastina are covered in later chapters. In this chapter, we will focus on the middle mediastinum, which is primarily occupied by the heart. Figure 1. Divisions of the mediastinum CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 1 \\nPERICARDIUM The pericardium is a sac-broad at the base and tapered at the top-that encloses the heart and is fused to the diaphragm inferiorly (Figure 2). The pericardium is pierced by the IVC inferiorly and four pulmonary veins posteriorly. Superiorly, the pericardium is prolonged out along the roots of the great vessels as they emerge from or drain into the heart. The outer layer of the sac, the fibrous pericardium, consists of dense connective tissue (Figure 2). Deep to the fibrous pericardium is the serous pericardium, a typical serous sac having continuous parietal and visceral layers. The parietal layer of the serous pericardium is fused to the fibrous pericardium. Thus, the \"bag\" of parietal pericardium surrounding the heart is composed of two fused layers. The outer layer of the heart is the visceral pericardium (aka epicardium). Between the visceral and parietal layers is the pericardial cavity, which contains a small amount of serous fluid. The function of this fluid is lubrication, reducing friction as the heart continuously beats. The pericardial cavity has two named spaces - the transverse and oblique pericardial sinuses (Figure 2). The transverse pericardial sinus is a passageway posterior to the outflow vessels of the heart (aorta and pulmonary trunk) and anterior to an inflow vessel (the superior vena cava). This sinus is a consequence of the folding of the heart tube described in your embryology lecture. The oblique pericardial sinus is completely separate from the transverse sinus. It is a blind recess defined by pericardial folds over the IVC and pulmonary veins posterior to the heart. Figure 2. Pericardium CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 2 \\nClinical correlate: Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium that may be caused by infection, surgery, radiation, or uremia (pericardium indicated by arrowheads below). This can lead to chest pain due to rubbing between the visceral and parietal layers known as pericardial friction rub (producing a \"rustle of silk\" sound on auscultation). Pericardial effusion is a buildup of excess fluid in the pericardial cavity (yellow arrows on the right). The pericardial cavity normally contains about 20-25 mL of serous fluid. The fibrous pericardium is only slightly distensible, but it may enlarge to hold up to 1 L with gradual increases in fluid. A rapid increase of ~150 mL of fluid after trauma, for instance, can cause compression of the heart known as cardiac tamponade, a medical emergency requiring rapid diagnosis. CONTENTS OF THE MIDDLE MEDIASTINUM In addition to the heart, the middle mediastinum contains portions of the great vessels: the aorta, pulmonary trunk, superior vena cava, and inferior vena cava. As a general rule, the great veins are on the right side of the mediastinum and the arteries are on the left (Figure 3). As the term suggests, the great vessels are large, often spanning multiple regions. Here we will highlight those portions that are in the middle mediastinum. Figure 3. Great vessels CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 3 \\nThe ascending aorta emerges from the left ventricle and gives off the coronary arteries (Figure 3). It passes anterior to the right pulmonary artery. The ascending aorta becomes the arch of the aorta as it passes the thoracic plane into the superior mediastinum (covered in the Superior Mediastinum chapter). The arch passes posteriorly and to the left, becoming the descending aorta as it crosses back through the thoracic plane into the posterior mediastinum (covered in the Posterior Mediastinum chapter). The pulmonary trunk carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs via the right and left pulmonary arteries. It lies inferior to the arch of the aorta directly anterior to the tracheal bifurcation (Figure 3). The superior vena cava (SVC) is formed from the union of the right and left brachiocephalic veins in the superior mediastinum before entering the middle mediastinum and draining into the right atrium (Figure 3). It drains blood from all regions superior to the diaphragm (but not the heart and lungs). The inferior vena cava (IVC) drains blood from the abdominopelvic cavity and lower extremities. Most of the IVC is in the abdomen covered in the Energetics & Homeostasis block; the portion in the middle mediastinum is extremely short. It enters through the caval hiatus in the diaphragm and quickly drains into the right atrium (cut IVC shown in Figure 2). NEUROVASCULATURE OF THE MIDDLE MEDIASTINUM NERVES The phrenic nerves originate from cervical nerves 3, 4, and 5, traverse the superior mediastinum, and travel on the surface of the fibrous pericardium anterior to the root of the lung on their way to innervate the diaphragm (Figure 4; \"C3, 4, 5 - keep the diaphragm alive!\"). These nerves also innervate the fibrous pericardium and the mediastinal parietal pleura as they descend between the two. Figure 4. Nerves of the middle mediastinum. Note that the phrenic nerves travel along the surface of the fibrous pericardium anterior to the root of the lung. Both vagus nerves pass posterior to the root of the lung-the left vagus nerve in close association with the arch of the aorta- before forming the esophageal plexus. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 4 \\nThe vagus nerves (CN X) supply parasympathetic and visceral afferent fibers to many targets in the neck, thorax, and abdomen and will, therefore, have multiple named branches covered in this block. CN x traverses the superior mediastinum and sends branches into the middle mediastinum by way of the cardiac plexus of autonomic nerves (Figure 4). Clinical correlate: Visceral afferents from the heart transmitting pain travel with sympathetic fibers back to spinal cord segments T1-T4, mostly on the left. Thus, angina pectoris (pain from reversible cardiac ischemia) is commonly felt as referred pain radiating from the chest and medial aspect of the left upper limb. CORONARY ARTERIES The right coronary artery (RCA) originates from the ascending aorta at the right aortic sinus, a space distal to the aortic semilunar valve defined in the next chapter on the Interior of the Heart. It continues to the right of the heart in the coronary sulcus, a groove between the atria and ventricles of the heart (Figure 5). Important branches of the RCA include the sinoatrial (SA) nodal artery to the region of the right atrium where the SA node resides and the right marginal artery to the right ventricle. The RCA typically terminates posteriorly as the posterior interventricular artery (see the Coronary Artery Dominance sub-section below). The posterior interventricular artery (clinically referred to as the posterior descending artery, or PDA) descends in the posterior interventricular sulcus, a vertical groove on the diaphragmatic surface of the heart that serves as a landmark for the interventricular septum. Figure 5. Coronary arteries and cardiac veins. Note the vessels that are in the coronary sinus, posterior interventricular septum, and anterior interventricular septum. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 5 \\nThe left coronary artery (LCA) originates from the left aortic sinus and passes posterior to the pulmonary trunk in the coronary sulcus (Figure 5). Just distal to its origin, the LCA bifurcates into the anterior interventricular and circumflex arteries. The anterior interventricular artery (clinically referred to as the left anterior descending artery, or LAD), descends in the anterior interventricular sulcus, a vertical groove on the anterior surface of the heart that serves as a landmark for the interventricular septum. The LAD supplies both right and left ventricles and most of the interventricular septum. The circumflex artery continues posteriorly in the coronary sulcus, typically terminating before it reaches the posterior interventricular sulcus (see sub-section below). Clinical correlate: Coronary angiography is used to visualize the lumen of coronary arteries. After a catheter is passed from the femoral artery into the ascending aorta, contrast material is injected at the openings of the RCA and LCA (LCA shown). Arteriograms are analyzed for stenosis of the coronary arteries and their branches. In descending order, the LAD, RCA, and circumflex a are the three most common sites of stenosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) are used to treat severe stenosis. The great saphenous vein may be harvested or the internal thoracic artery may be redirected to shunt blood from the aorta to the area past the stenotic coronary artery. In some patients, coronary angioplasty is used instead. In this procedure, a balloon catheter is inserted into the blockage, the balloon inflates to re-open the circulation, and usually a stent is left at the site of blockage to keep the artery open. Coronary artery dominance is determined by which of the coronary arteries (right or left) gives rise to the posterior descending artery (PDA, aka posterior interventricular a). As mentioned above, the PDA is typically a terminal branch of the RCA.Therefore, about 70 % of hearts are right dominant (Figure 6). With this configuration, the RCA and LCA have a fairly balanced distribution with the RCA supplying most of the right heart and the posterior 1/3 of the interventricular septum and the LCA supplying most of the left heart and the anterior 2/3 of the interventricular septum. Contrast that with a left-dominant heart, where most of the heart including all of the interventricular septum is supplied by branches of the LCA.Figure 6. Coronary artery dominance. RCA and branches shown in green, LCA and branches shown in red with a cross-section to show the interventricular septum. The remaining 15 % of hearts are referred to as co-dominant. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 6 \\nCARDIAC VEINS Cardiac veins collect deoxygenated blood from the heart wall and generally run in parallel with coronary arteries (Figure 5). Blood in the cardiac veins drains into the coronary sinus, the large vein in the coronary sulcus on the left side of the heart, before draining into the right atrium. The great cardiac vein is in the anterior interventricular sulcus with the LAD.As this vein passes posteriorly around the heart it joins other veins draining the left atrium and ventricle to form the coronary sinus. The middle cardiac vein travels with the PDA in the posterior interventricular sulcus. The small cardiac vein travels with the right marginal artery, then posteriorly in the coronary sulcus to drain into the coronary sinus. There are alternate routes of venous drainage that do not involve the coronary sinus. These alternate routes are relatively small and will be difficult to see in the lab. Two or three anterior cardiac veins drain blood from the anterior surface of the right ventricle, cross over the RCA, and drain directly into the right atrium. The smallest cardiac veins (Thebesian veins or venae cordis minimae) are tiny veins in the walls of each of the four chambers of the heart that drain directly into those chambers. They are most numerous is the right atrium and least numerous in the left ventricle.

CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Pericardium and Coronary Circulation 7 \\n Oxygen delivery (DO2): Amount of milk carried by the truck per day your store off the truck Mixed Venous Oxygen Content and the Corner Grocery Store The factors that determine mixed venous oxygen content is often a source of confusion. Here is a simple analogy that may help it make sense. Suppose you own and run a small grocery store in your neighborhood, where you sell 10 gallons of milk/day to your customers. You have an agreement with the dairy farm which produces the milk that they will send a delivery truck to your store each day of the week. The delivery truck leaves the dairy farm with 100 gallons of milk each delivery run as it heads out to your store. When it arrives, you offload 10 gallons of milk, leaving 90 gallons in the truck as it heads off to its next delivery stop. In this analogy, you can think of things in this manner: Oxygen consumption (VVOO22):The amount of milk you sell each day Mixed venous oxygen content (CCvvOO22): The amount of milk left in the truck as it leaves arteriovenous oxygen content difference (CCaaOO22-\\tCCvvOO22): The amount of milk you take Now to build this analogy further and help you understand the factors that affect the mixed venous oxygen content, we can consider a few scenarios: Scenario 1: Gas Prices Rise Suppose there is a recession and gas prices rise significantly such that the dairy farm says they can now only come once a week, rather than once a day. The delivery truck still only carries 100 gallons at a time. You are still selling 10 gallons of milk per day, which works out to 70 gallons per week. Now, when the delivery truck comes that one time a week to your store, you remove 70 gallons of milk, leaving only 30 gallons in the truck as it heads off to the next stop. We can see that delivery decreased in the face of constant consumption. As a result, you have to extract more milk from the truck and, as a result, there is less milk in the truck when it leaves your store. This is what occurs in cardiogenic shock, with decreased oxygen delivery. Scenario 2: Word Gets Out that Milk is Good For You Suppose the economy has recovered and gas prices have come down, such that the dairy farm is back to doing daily deliveries. Now, due to a big push from the surgeon general, word has gotten out that drinking milk is good for growing kids. As a result, demand from the local community has increased and you are now selling 20 gallons of milk per day. Delivery is back to where it was at the start of our story - 100 gallons/day - but consumption has increased to 20 gallons a day. As a result, you will take more milk off the truck when it arrives and leave only 80 gallons in the truck as it heads off to the next stop on its delivery run. We can, therefore, see that if consumption rises in the face of constant delivery, extraction must increase, and as a result, the amount of milk in the truck heading away from your store has gone done. This is analogous to what happens during heavy exercise, when oxygen consumption increases more than oxygen delivery. Scenario 3: Your Store is Closed for the Day Suppose you have to close the store for a day to tend to a family matter but forgot to tell the dairy farm not to bring any milk that day. The people in your community did not learn about this \\neither but still want to consume their 10 gallons of milk per day. When the driver arrives with the truck full of 100 gallons of milk, none of the milk can be offloaded at the store. As a result, the driver will head off to the next stop with 100 gallons still in the back of the truck. This situation would be akin to cyanide poisoning. Even though delivery is fine, the item being delivered - in this case, milk - isn\\'t being utilized because the store is shut down, much like the mitochondria are shut down by the effects of cyanide on cytochrome oxidase. \\n Conference 9: Answers to Hypertension Case 1 A 25 year-old man who was previously well, is seen for a routine job physical for insurance. He has no complaints. Examination is normal other than a blood pressure of 145/92. 1. Does this patient have hypertension? A single reading is not sufficient to diagnose hypertension. Patients are often anxious when they come to the physician\\'s office. BP should be repeated. The average of two or more properly measured BP readings at each of two or more office visits after an initial screen. To ensure proper measurement: o Patients should be sitting with back supported for 5 minutes o Arm should be supported at the level of the heart o No caffeine an hour prior, no nicotine 30 minutes prior o Must use appropriate cuff size CPR - Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology White coat hypertension. This should be considered, and can be assessed by accurately measured home BP readings or a 24hr ambulatory blood pressure monitor. [Note, white coat hypertension is not completely benign, and has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes] 2. Do younger adults typically have more elevated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or systolic BP (SBP) and please explain your answer? What is the case for older adults? Younger adults have elevated DBP because of better elastic recoil of the aorta. SBP tends to be lower because of the cushioning capacity of the aorta in systole. Older adults have the potential for more injury to the elastic properties of the aorta and potentially have less cushioning, so higher SBP, with less recoil [ lower DBP] 3. What questions would you ask the patient? What screening tests would be useful? The questions and tests are based on trying to determine if there is a secondary cause for the hypertension, and also to determine if there is any end-organ damage. 1 \\n Secondary Causes Ask about chronic pain issues, sports-related injuries. May be clue to chronic or Use of stimulants: Ask about illicit drug use. Order toxicology screen Primary renal disease. Ask about blood in urine. Look at urine sediment. Order heavy NSAID use. chemistry panel. Primary hyperaldosteronism: Ask about history of electrolyte disorders (low K, high bicarbonate). Order chemistry panel. Evaluate plasma renin and aldosterone levels. Expect elevated aldosterone, suppressed renin. Coarctation of the aorta: Ask about symptoms of claudication. Measure blood pressures in upper and lower extremities. Check for diminished or delayed femoral pulses (\"brachial-femoral delay\"). Order echocardiogram. Fibromuscular dysplasia. Check for electrolyte disorders (low K, high bicarbonate). Evaluate renal arteries. Pheochromocytoma. Ask about headache, sweating, palpitations. 24 hour urine collection of fractionated metanephrines and catecholamines Hyperthyroidism. Ask about anxiety, tremor, palpitations, weight loss. Check o Family history - hypertension is 2x more common if one or both parents o Low birth weight - associated with hypertension have HTN TSH.  Other: End Organ Damage Consider o Heart - left ventricular hypertrophy (EKG or ECHO) o Eyes - retinopathy (funduscopy) o Kidney - hypertensive nephrosclerosis (serum creatinine, proteinuria) o Brain - stroke / encephalopathy / PRES: unlikely in this young patient with modest increase in BP 4. Assuming no secondary causes of HTN are uncovered, what non-pharmaceutical interventions will lower BP? Lifestyle interventions in the treatment and prevention of hypertension Intervention Weight loss Increased physical activity Low Na+ diet Comments BP drops by ~1mm Hg for each kg of weight loss Moderate exercise reduces BP by 2-3 mm Hg Na+ intake <1.5g per day reduces BP by 5-6 mm Hg 2 \\nHigh K+ diet Smoking cessation Decreased alcohol intake Decrease caffeine Avoid medications / drugs associated with HTN K+ intake 3.5-5g per day reduces BP by 4-5 mm Hg Limit to 2 drinks per day for males, 1 drink for females Regular coffee drinking (<1-2 cups/day) does not increase chronic BP NSAIDs, estrogen containing contraceptives, decongestants, steroids, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy 5. What agent would you begin if lifestyle modifications do not work? ACE Inhibitor, thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker are all reasonable choices. Young subjects more likely have RAAS mediated HTN and an ACEI would be a good 1st choice. Case 2 A 65 year-old man is referred to your clinic for uncontrolled hypertension. He is on the following medications: Furosemide, doxazosin, atenolol, clonidine. His PMH is notable for HTN for more than 20 years and past tobacco history. In your office his BP is 160/60 in the left arm and 120/60 in the right arm and both are reproducible. His BMI is 30. His creatinine is 1.0 mg/dl and his K is 4 mmmol/L.1. Does this patient have HTN? Which BP should you follow? Yes. The reading in the right arm is likely low because of vascular insufficiency to that arm. You should teach this patient to have readings done for BP management in the left arm only. 2. What secondary causes of HTN would you like to exclude? Renal artery stenosis Hyper/Hypothyroidism Primary hyperaldosteronism, Glomerulonephritis (check renal panel and urinalysis) Obstructive sleep apnea. None of these agents are first-line anti-hypertensive agents. 3. Discuss his medication regimen and consider what changes you would make o Furosemide-not first line diuretic for HTN unless edema (from heart or o Doxazosin - may be used in benign prostatic hypertrophy or PTSD - but liver problems or nephrotic syndrome or CKD with GFR <30) increased risk of heart failure in ALLHAT study 3 \\n Which meds would you consider instead? First line meds would be ACD- o ACE-inhibitors/Angiotensin Receptor Blockers o Calcium channel blockers o Diuretic, such as chlorthalidone Think of the patient\\'s HTN being either caused by increased SVR or volume excess. May consider ACE-inhibitors or diuretic first and add the other if BP not controlled. 4. What about his BP portends a bad prognosis and why? Increased pulse pressure reflecting stiff vessels Case 3 A 30 year-old woman presents with HTN for 10 years on an ACE-inhibitor. Her urinalysis shows hematuria. Her creatinine is 1.0 mg/dl. 1. What is the most likely cause of her hypertension? Hypertension since age 20 suggests a secondary cause. Assuming her hematuria is persistent, she may have an underlying kidney disease, possibly glomerulonephritis (? IgA nephropathy). Kidney disease is the commonest secondary cause of hypertension. Patients with glomerulonephritis often have HTN, hematuria and decreased GFR.(note creatinine of 1.0 mg/dl might be elevated for this woman) 2. How will you make a diagnosis? Urine protein evaluation. Blood tests for specific causes of glomerulonephritis (eg ANA for lupus, hepatitis serologies, complement levels). Kidney biopsy should be considered for definitive diagnosis if abnormal kidney function or increased proteinuria. o Atenolol - not the best beta blocker to use for HTN.Beta blockers should be considered if patient has systolic dysfunction, MI, angina or arrhythmia o Clonidine - sedating, dosed frequently, and may cause withdrawal HTN 3. What do you think about the use of an ACE-inhibitor in this patient? ACEI are a good choice if the patient has kidney disease and proteinuria (renoprotective). However, women of childbearing age may become pregnant and ACE-inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy as they can cause congenital malformation of the fetus. The patient should be counseled about this and birth control should be considered. Case 4 A 65 year-old man transfers his care to your office for hypertension which he says is uncontrolled by his current physician. His BMI is 24, he is on a low sodium diet (trying to 4 \\nachieve < 1.5 gm sodium per day) and exercises 6 days a week for 30 minutes each day. He is on atenolol 50 mg and his BP has gone from 160/95 to 154/92 after adjustments from 25 mg to 50 mg. 1. What are your initial considerations for this patient? He has excellent adherence to lifestyle measures but HTN remains uncontrolled. Have we ruled out secondary HTN? o Given patient\\'s age, and lack of secondary features, it is most likely that o He is only on a single (& inappropriate) agent, and an extensive o Reasonable 2nd workup here would include thorough examination, secondary HTN workup may not be warranted at this stage. patient has primary hypertension urinalysis, Chem7, thyroid function tests. (Can discuss extent of secondary workup in class) Does he have white coat HTN? o The diagnosis of white coat hypertension is considered when office readings average >130/80 - 140/90 mm Hg and reliable out-of-office readings average < 130/80 o Ask patient to monitor blood pressures at home. This patient had similar readings at home. Consider ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). He did a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor and HTN noted on this. 2. Is he on the correct BP medication? No. He is not getting adequate BP reduction on atenolol. Beta blockers should not be first line BP medication unless patient has a clear history of: MI, CAD, arrhythmia, LV dysfunction. ACEI / calcium antagonists or diuretic likely best first line. May try ACE inhibitor to see if his BP is RAAS mediated. Note he is older and may be salt sensitive and a thiazide diuretic is also a very reasonable first choice. Case 5 An 80 y/o woman with hypertension and joint pain presents to her physician for a routine physical and is noted to have a BP of 160/96. This BP is reproducible on two other visits. She is active and lives with her daughter. 1. What are considerations for secondary causes of HTN? Ask about NSAID use. May be taking for joint pain. Assess thyroid function. Hypothyroidism not uncommon in elderly Declining renal function may be leading to HTN.Renovascular disease common in elderly 5 \\n  Evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) 2. Should her blood pressure be treated? Yes. Clinical trials of hypertension in the elderly have consistently demonstrated benefit from antihypertensive therapy, including patients over age 80 y.o. A study of hypertension in patients 80 years or older (N Engl J Med. 2008; 358(18):1887) demonstrated that aiming for BP <150/80 reduced overall death, strokes, and heart failure. A thiazide diuretic + ACE-inhibitor were used in this study. More recent guidelines (2017) suggest an even lower BP target in the elderly (<130/80), but note older patients are more sensitive to the side effects of BP medications, and more likely to fall. Could use a diuretic, CCB or ACEI.Diuretics often used 1st line in elderly as may 3. What agent would you use? be salt sensitive. Case 6 23 year-old woman has a history of hypertension and she is controlled on a beta-blocker. She becomes pregnant. 1. What do you expect will happen to her BP and why? It will decrease in the first trimester and you will likely need to stop her blood pressure medication. Her blood pressure will decrease throughout most of the pregnancy because of both vasodilatory hormones and because of a decreased systemic vascular resistance related to a large uterus and diverted blood supply to this organ. Humans organs are in parallel and the equation for resistance is 1/R=1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 etc. Cardiac output goes up in pregnancy and SVR decreases. 6 2. At 36 weeks her BP increases to 144/92. What are considerations at this time? Ensure that she does not have preeclampsia versus return of her chronic HTN that predated the pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia is an obstetric emergency where pregnant women develop worsening hypertension and proteinuria, sometimes visual problems or headache. Complications may include hemolysis, abnormal liver function and seizures. Emergent delivery is required. \\n Kidney Case Vignettes Authors: Ryan Wong and Sarah Sanghavi Case 1 A 75 year-old woman with history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the hospital after being found pinned under a chest of drawers. She was last seen 3 days ago in her normal state of health. Shortly after, she experienced a fall and was unable to phone for help. She was found to have a left hip fracture. She was adequately volume resuscitated with crystalloid. Her admitting creatinine was 0.9. Over the next 24 hours, she only made 500 mls of urine.

The FeNa is >2% and the urine sediment shows many muddy brown casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis. The specific gravity is 1.010 or isosthenuric urine (similar to plasma). This is a common finding in ATN, which suggests tubular dysfunction and inability to concentrate or dilute urine compared to plasma. This sodium/chloride rich tubular fluid gets delivered to the ascending limb of the loop of Henle where the macula densa senses excess chloride delivery. Renin is released resulting in afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction. Renal tubular epithelial (RTE) cells die and slough off into the tubular lumen. These cells can get caught in uromodulin that is made in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and resulting in tubular obstruction. Tubular obstruction decreases filtration by disrupting the hydrostatic and oncotic forces across the glomerulus. The sloughed RTE cells and uromodulin form casts of the tubule that can be seen on urine microscopy. The etiology of ATN in this case is rhabdomyolysis. Rhabdomyolysis can occur after crush injuries (ie car accidents), compartment syndrome, or prolonged immobility. Elevated potassium and phosphorus and low calcium are typical findings as dying muscle cells release potassium and phosphorus and calcium becomes sequestered and bound to phosphorus. The urinalysis demonstrates an important concept. The dipstick is positive for blood, but the microscopy is negative for RBCs. Myoglobinuria should be suspected in this scenario and if not already ordered, a CPK should be obtained. Myoglobin is toxic to the tubular cells resulting in tubular cell injury. Free hemoglobin, in cases of hemolysis, is also toxic to the tubules. It is important to consider other causes of kidney injury. This patient\\'s case is not consistent with a pre- renal etiology because adequate fluid resuscitation failed to reverse the kidney injury. The history does not mention concern for renal vascular compromise. The urinalysis was negative for proteinuria (albuminuria) or RBCs which makes a glomerular injury less likely. The paucity of WBC\\'s makes acute interstitial nephritis unlikely. The normal renal ultrasound does not describe obstruction or other post renal abnormalities. \\nCase 2 26 year-old with a history of alcohol abuse presented to the ED encephalopathic. He was found in the garage by a friend next to an empty bottle. The friend called EMS.Vitals: Tachycardic, afebrile, normotensive Exam: GEN: sedated HEENT: normal fundoscopic exam, dry oral mucosa PULM: tachypneic, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales CV: tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, gallops ABD: soft, nontender EXT: no lower extremity edema Laboratory Values: ABG: 7.24/28/95/13 Plasma Osmolarity 314 mOsm/kg H2O Urine Sediment: \\nDiagnosis: Elevated gap metabolic acidosis and acute kidney injury from ethylene glycol ingestion From the laboratory values provided, the patient has an acidemia. Since the pCO2 is low and the serum bicarbonate is low, this is a metabolic acidosis. To help narrow the differential, it is important to determine if there is an elevated gap. The anion gap is 25, which is greater than a normal gap of 12. AG = Na - Cl - HCO3 = 136 - 98 - 13 = 25 There is normal respiratory compensation. Winter\\'s formula predicts a pCO2 of 25-29. Winter\\'s Formula = Predicted pCO2 = 1.5 (HCO3) + 8 +/- 2 = 1.5 (13) + 8 +/- 2 = 27.5 +/- 2 The delta-gap is the difference between the actual gap and the expected gap. In this case, it is 25-12 =13. This means the gap acidosis accounts for a bicarb deficit of 13. If we add 13 to the actual bicarbonate of 13, we get 26. Since 26 is a normal bicarbonate level, we have a pure gap metabolic acidosis. The Osm Gap = Lab Plasma Osm - Calculated Osm = 314 - 287 = 27 An elevated osm gap of 27 suggests the presence of unmeasured osmoles (eg methanol, ethylene glycol, or acetone). With the finding of oxalate crystals in the urine, the most likely cause of this acid- base disturbance is ethylene glycol toxic ingestion. Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase into glycolic acid which contributes to the elevated anion gap. Oxalate is another metabolite that can precipitate with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals. These crystals can precipitate in the renal tubules resulting in obstruction and injury. Other findings are CNS depression, tachycardia, hyperventilation, arrhythmias. Treatment involves urine alkalinization, fomepizole (alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor), or hemodialysis. Delta gap = anion gap- expected anion gap = 25- 12 = 13 Delta gap + actual bicarbonate = 26 The next step is to figure out if there are excess osmoles which may suggest toxic ingestions. Calculated Osm = 2 (Na) + BUN / 2.8 + Glucose / 18 = 2 (136) + 28 / 2.8 + 90 / 18 = 272 + 10 + 5 = 287 \\nCase 3 A 29 year-old man is found obtunded. His friends note that in the past 4 days the patient was taking a lot of pain medication after he injured himself during a pick-up game of basketball. The ED started IV hydration and the following labs were obtained. Vitals BP 114/70 RR 25 O2 sat 100% on ambient air GEN: sedated HEENT: normal fundoscopic exam, dry oral mucosa PULM: tachypneic, no wheezes, no rhonchi, no rales CV: tachycardic, no murmurs/rubs/gallops ABD: soft, nontender EXT: no lower extremity edema Laboratory Values 7.30/22/90/16 Lactate: 7 Serum Osm 290 Salicylate: pending Acetaminophen: pending Toxic Alcohol: pending \\nDiagnosis: Elevated Gap acidosis with respiratory alkalosis from salicylate poisoning This patient has an acidemia. The pCO2 and the serum bicarbonate are low suggesting a primary metabolic acidosis. The patient has an elevated gap acidosis with an anion gap of 20. Winter\\'s formula predicts a pCO2 of 32. However, the pCO2 is 22, which is lower than predicted. Therefore, there is a concomitant respiratory alkalosis. The delta gap is 8. (Anion gap - expected gap = 20- 12 = 8). When added to the actual bicarbonate, this results in 24, which is a normal bicarbonate value.. Therefore, this is a pure gap acidosis. The osm gap is < 10, which does not support a toxic alcohol ingestion. The elevated gap can be explained by the elevated lactate. The combination of an elevated gap acidosis and a respiratory alkalosis is commonly associated with salicylate toxicity. Salicylate toxicity can be intentional or accidental, as in this case. A patient may present early in the overdose and may only have a respiratory alkalosis. As the salicylate impairs oxidative phosphorylation, lactic acid accumulates, and an elevated gap develops. Other presenting symptoms can be tinnitus (CN VIII impairment), pulmonary edema, and bleeding abnormalities. Treatment involves alkalinizing the serum and urine to keep the molecule out of the CNS and ultimately excreted into the renal tubules for excretion. Dialysis may be needed. \\nHR 80 RR 12 O2 sat: 95% on ambient air Case 4 A 35 year-old man with no known past medical history presents to the clinic appointment with uncontrolled hypertension. His home medications are lisinopril, chlorthalidone, and amlodipine, which he takes as prescribed. He does not use decongestants or NSAIDs. He has no symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and has not experienced shortness of breath, palpitations, diarrhea, vomiting, changes in urine output, or skin flushing. Vitals: T 37C BP 150/90 Exam: Gen: Comfortable, No acute distress HEENT: Atraumatic, normocephalic, PEERL, No JVP CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs, gallops PULM: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, rales ABD: soft, nontender, nondistended, BS present, no striae SKIN: warm, no flushing EXT: no lower extremity swelling Labs: pH 7.48/45/85/32 Urine Na 30 Urine K 40 Urine Cl 35 PRA: <1 (low) Aldosterone: 25 (high) \\nDiagnosis: Primary Hyperaldosteronism: hypertensive metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia He has resistant hypertension since he is on 3 blood pressure medications including a diuretic with inadequate blood pressure control. His young age raises suspicion for a secondary cause of hypertension. There is no mention of palpitations or flushing that would suggest a pheochromocytoma. The exam is not consistent with hypercortisolism (Cushing\\'s) which can have physical exam findings of abdominal striae, moonlike facies, and a posterior neck fat pad. The labs reveal a metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia. The urine chloride is elevated (>20 meq/L), which is inconsistent with volume depletion or GI bicarbonate loss. His high aldosterone and suppressed renin suggest a diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism. This can be from an adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. In addition to increasing vascular tone, hyperaldosteronism causes hypertension by acting on the principal cell of the cortical collecting duct. Aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor resulting in upregulation of the Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC) and the Na-K-ATPase channel. Increased ENaC activity causes sodium reabsorption and volume expansion leading to hypertension. Sodium reabsorption establishes a negative charge in the tubular lumen, which creates a favorable electrochemical gradient for potassium secretion through ROMK.Upregulated Na-K- ATPase, in this setting, helps to maintain these gradients for sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. \\nHR 88 bpm RR 12 O2 sat: 99% on ambient air Case 5 A healthy 22 year-old woman presents to the clinic for laboratory follow up for hypokalemia. She has been experiencing orthostatic symptoms for the past 3 months. She urinates frequently, which has been her \"normal.\" She denies diarrhea, vomiting, prescription or over the counter medications. There is no significant family history. Vitals: T 37C BP 95/40 Exam: Gen: normal, thin HEENT: dry oral mucosa, normal dentition, no JVP CV: normal Pulm: normal Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended Skin: dry, warm to touch, no rashes Ext: normal muscle mass Labs: pH 7.48/45/93/34 Calcium 9.8 mg/dL Magnesium 1.4 mEq/L Urine Na 60 mEq/L Urine K 60 mEq/L (high) Urine Cl 65 mEq/L (high) Urine Ca: Creatinine: 50mg/g (low) Diuretic Screen: negative \\nDiagnosis: Gitelman\\'s Syndrome This patient has hypokalemia. The history does not suggest a cause from medications, GI losses, or pseudohypokalemia. She has an alkalosis and is hypo/normotensive. The differential for hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, with normotension/hypotension includes vomiting, diuretics, channelopathies (Bartter\\'s, Gitelman\\'s), or hypomagnesemia. There is no history of vomiting. The diuretic screen is negative, and the magnesium is normal. The suspicion is high for channelopathies. Remember that Bartter\\'s act like patients on loop diuretics (NKCC2 channel) and Gitelman\\'s act like patients on thiazides (NaCl Channel). They both cause hypokalemia with potassium and sodium wasting. However, thiazides result in hypocalciuria (low urine calcium). Thus, this patient most likely has Gitelman\\'s disease. Bartter\\'s syndrome usually presents earlier in life. Normally the NKCC2 channel helps maintain a positively charged tubular lumen. Although the NKCC2 channel is electrically neutral, ROMK (potassium backleak) channels create a positive tubular lumen. The positive tubular lumen provides a favorable gradient for calcium and magnesium to be reabsorbed paracellularly. Without this gradient, urinary calcium loss results. \\nHR 88 bpm RR 12 O2 Sat: 99% on ambient air Case 6 A 40 year-old woman with a history of kidney stones presents to clinic with a 1-year history of dry eyes, dry mouth, and arthralgias. Recently, she has been irritated by a feeling that something is in her eye. She saw an ophthalmologist who confirmed dry eyes and recommended artificial tears. The artificial tears only provide temporary relief. She has difficulty eating dry foods and noticed her cheeks becoming fuller. She denies diarrhea and does not take over the counter medications. Vitals: T 37C BP 110/70 Physical Exam: Gen: comfortable HEENT: dry oral mucosa, multiple fillings, bilateral parotid enlargement, no JVP, CV: RRR, no rubs/gallops/murmurs Pulm: clear to auscultation Abd: soft, nontender, nondistended Skin: dry, no rashes Ext: normal muscle mass Laboratory: ABG: 7.32/34/90/14 Anti-Ro/ssA antibodies: Positive Antinuclear Antibodies: Positive Rheumatoid Factor: Positive Urinalysis pH 7.0 protein: negative glucose: negative heme: negative nitrites: negative Urine Na: 40 mEq/L Urine K: 60 mEq/L Urine Cl: 14 mEq/L \\n Diagnosis: Normal gap metabolic acidosis due to hypokalemic, distal RTA type 1 in a patient with Sjogren\\'s syndrome This patient has a normal gap metabolic acidosis with an anion gap of 5. There is no indication of GI bicarbonate losses (eg diarrhea or GI surgeries). To support our suspicion of a renal etiology, the urine anion gap can be used. Urine anion gap = Na + K - Cl = 40 + 60 + 14 = 86 Normally, kidneys excrete H+ in the form of ammonium (NH4 +) in the setting of an acidosis. Positively charged ammonium is excreted with negatively charged chloride. The laboratory can measure urinary chloride, which is used as a surrogate marker for ammonium. If this patient\\'s tubules were working correctly, urinary ammonium and urinary chloride would be high. A high urinary chloride would make the urine anion gap negative. The urine anion gap is > 20 and supports a diagnosis of renal tubular acidosis. Hypokalemia rules out a type 4 RTA and leaves distal (type 1) or proximal (type 2) RTAs. The urine pH is high because the alpha-intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct are not acidifying the urine appropriately. This patient has a hypokalemic distal RTA type 1. This patient has Sjogren\\'s syndrome, which is characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth. It is a common cause of type 1 distal RTA.The exact mechanism is unclear but may be related to antibodies disrupting alpha-intercalated cells. Injury of the alpha-intercalated cells results in impaired H+ excretion and metabolic acidosis. \\nBP 130/65 Case 7 A 50 year-old woman with a history of hypertension and diabetes type 2 is brought to the hospital because a friend noticed she was acting oddly. Since her spouse died 6 months ago, she has been depressed leading to a poor appetite. She has also been medicating with beer. She denies fever, chills, heat/cold intolerance, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, changes in urine output. Vitals: T 36.7 C Exam: Gen: Mild lethargy, oriented HEENT: Normal JVP, normal oral mucosa Lungs: CTAB Heart: RRR, no r/g/m Extremities: warm, well-perfused, no edema Neuro: Slow in speech and movements Labs: HR 75 RR 16 O2 Sat 98% on ambient air Serum Osm 265mosm/L Urine Osm: 75 mosm/L Urine sodium: 20 meq/L CXR: Stable lung nodule \\nDiagnosis: Hyponatremia due to a low solute diet, \"beer potomania\" Her symptoms are most likely due to her low serum sodium level (hyponatremia) which indicates excess extracellular water. The serum osmolarity is low (hypo-osmolar hyponatremia). She appears to be euvolemic based on the physical exam and vitals. The next step is to determine if this process is driven by excess water intake or decreased water excretion. Since the urine osmolarity is low, ADH is low, and this hyponatremic process is ADH independent. The differential includes too much water (psychogenic polydipsia) or not enough osmoles (tea and toast/beer potomania). The clinical picture suggests poor osmole intake. Beer lacks significant osmoles (sodium or protein). The kidney must have osmoles to excrete excess free water. If this person were to drop their osmole intake to 200 mosm/day from 600 mosm/day. They would only be able to manage 2.7L of free water (200mosm/day ÷ 75 mosm/kg = 2.7L) compared to 8L of free water (600 mosm/day ÷ 75 mosm/kg = 8L). Therefore, if water ingestion exceeds 2.7 L, it will be retained and lower the serum sodium. Lung carcinomas can contribute to hyponatremia via secretion of ADH and result in a syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH). In this case, the urine osmolarity should be > 100. The CXR finding is a red herring. \\nCase 8 A 50 year-old woman with bipolar disorder and osteoarthritis presents with poor oral intake for 4 days. She was discharged from the hospital 4 days ago after a left hip arthroplasty. However, due to significant pain and nausea, she hasn\\'t been eating or drinking much. She feels thirsty. Since leaving the hospital, she has continued to take ibuprofen as needed for pain and her prescribed lithium for bipolar disorder. She has not taken any new medications. She denies fevers, chills, diarrhea, or changes in urine output. Vitals: T: 37C Urine output: 3L in the last 24 hours Exam: Alert, appropriate Normal oral mucosa Nonelevated JVP Labs: HR 80 RR: 15 O2 Sat 98% on ambient air BP 115/75 UA SG: 1.004 Protein: neg Heme: neg Serum Osm: 310 Urine Osm: 150 Urine Na: 30 After DDAVP Urine Osm: 170 Urine Na: 30 \\nDiagnosis: Hypernatremia due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus The important points in her history are her use of lithium and polyuria, 3L urine output in 24 hours despite little oral intake. Hypernatremia results when water excretion exceeds water intake. Normally osmoreceptors would sense hyperosmolarity, stimulate ADH release from the pituitary, and cause urinary free water retention in the kidney leading to concentrated urine with a high urine osmolarity. Her urine is more dilute than would be expected (<300 mOsm) in the setting of hypernatremia. Therefore, there must be either a defect in ADH production (central diabetes insipidus) or ADH resistance (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). These two conditions can be differentiated based on their response to exogenous administration of DDAVP (vasopressin). In this case, there was no change in urinary concentrating ability after DDAVP administration, and so the diagnosis is nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. It is important to note that people with normal thirst mechanisms should be able to maintain normal sodium levels as long as they have access to water. The most likely cause of her nephrogenic DI is lithium. Lithium navigates the renal tubule in a similar manner to sodium. Lithium can enter the principal cell through ENaC in the cortical collecting duct where it inhibits AQP-2 phosphorylation and insertion into the apical membrane. Subsequently, water is not able to be reabsorbed from the tubule and dilute urine results. In this case, ADH is functional, but the patient is ADH resistant. The effect of lithium can be reversed in the short term but can be permanent with long term use. \\nCase 9 A 10 year-old girl with no past medical history presents to the hospital with bilateral lower extremity swelling and fullness of her face. She was in her normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when she was no longer able to fit into her shoes and then her pants. Her urine has been very foamy recently, but without changes in amount or color. She had not been on any new medications. Vitals T 37C BP 120/75 Gen: Well-appearing girl HEENT: periorbital swelling, elevated JVP PULM: clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, no rhonchi CV: RRR, no murmurs, rubs gallops ABD: abdominal wall edema, soft, nontender EXT: 2+ bilateral symmetric lower extremity edema to the mid thigh Labs: HR 90 RR 14 O2 Sat 98% on ambient air Total Cholesterol 200 mg/dL LDL: 110 mg/dL UA: pH 5.5 SG 1.010 Protein 3+ Blood: Neg RBCs: 0 WBC\\'s 0 Protein Creatinine Ratio: 6g/g AST: 30 units/l ALT: 25 units/l Albumin 2.8g/dL Urine Sediment: 1: renalfellownetwork.com \\nDiagnosis: Nephrotic Syndrome - Minimal Change Disease This patient has sudden onset swelling. Patients with nephrotic syndrome often notice periorbital swelling and report frothy or foamy urine. She has normal kidney function and 3+ protein on the urinalysis. A urine protein to creatinine ratio was obtained which showed nephrotic range proteinuria (>3.5g/day) with low albumin. Her urine sediment reveals Maltese crosses in polarized light significant for lipiduria. Therefore, she has all the features of nephrotic syndrome including proteinuria, edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and lipiduria. The most likely diagnosis in this patient with nephrotic syndrome and no features of nephritis is minimal change disease. If she is biopsied, light and immunofluorescence will be normal, but electron microscopy will show diffuse podocyte foot process effacement. Treatment is typically with steroids, and children tend to respond quite well. \\nBP 150/90 Case 10 A 60 year-old woman presented to the ED with shortness of breath and sudden onset of small amounts of hemoptysis. She was in her normal state of health until she developed shortness of breath 2 days ago. Her review of systems was positive for dark colored urine. She denies any blood thinners, new medications, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or recent illnesses. Vitals: T 37 Gen: Well-appearing woman HEENT: normal, no elevated JVP, PULM: fine crackles bilaterally at the bases, no wheezes, no rhonchi CV: tachycardic, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops ABD: abdominal wall edema, soft, nontender EXT: 1+ bilateral lower extremity edema, no rashes Labs: HR 90 RR 20 O2 Sat 93% 3L NC Urine Sediment: 2:medical-labs.net Baseline Cr: 0.8 (1 month ago) Hepatitis B negative Hepatitis C negative SPEP: negative ANA: negative ANCA: pending Anti- GBM: pending UA pH 5.5 SG 1.010 Protein 1+ Blood: 2+ RBCs: >10 /hpf WBC\\'s negative Protein Creatinine ratio: 1g/g CXR: bilateral pulmonary infiltrates Renal Biopsy: Light: Glomerular crescents Immunofluorescence: Linear IgG and C3 staining \\n Diagnosis: Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis from Anti-GBM disease - Goodpasture\\'s disease This clinical picture is concerning for a nephritic picture. She has decreased eGFR, hematuria, proteinuria, and hypertension. The urinary sediment revealing RBC casts and dysmorphic RBCs supports this diagnosis. Her creatinine was normal 1 month ago and now is 3.1 which may suggest a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Typical offenders are ANCA vasculitis, lupus nephritis, HSP/IgA vasculitis, or anti-GBM.This patient\\'s biopsy has crescentic disease which is seen in RPGN diseases. The history points toward a pulmonary - renal syndrome: ANCA vasculitis or anti-GBM disease. In some cases, the serologic findings arrive after the biopsy, but ordering ANCA serologies as well as anti-GBM will help in the diagnosis. The renal biopsy reported in this case supports a diagnosis of anti-GBM disease. Anti-GBM disease occurs when antibodies are formed against the a-3 subunit of type IV collagen. This antibody attacks the GBM uniformly and shows up as linear staining of IgG and C3 on immunofluorescence. This subtype of type IV collagen is also found in the alveolar basement membrane and can result in alveolar hemorrhage. When this occurs, clinicians refer to this as Goodpasture\\'s syndrome. \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 8: ECG in Ischemia Day: 12 Hours: 3 and 4 Exercise 1 A 55 year-old patient experienced sudden onset of extreme substernal chest pain that radiated down their left arm. Coworkers called the paramedics, who arrived 5 minutes later. At that time, the patient was still experiencing chest pain, appearing diaphoretic and ashen. An ECG was performed: Question 1 What is the diagnosis? The patient is experiencing an anterior STEMI with involvement of the septum and lateral walls. ST segments are considered elevated if they are: Atleast 1 mm high in atleast 2 contiguous limb leads (I, II, III, avR, avL, avF) or Atleast 2 mm high in atleast 2 contiguous the precordial leads (V1-V6) Note, continuous leads are leads that are anatomically next to eachother. This patient has ST elevations across the precordium (V2-V6), and there are slight ST elevations in I and aVL. 8-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 What are the next appropriate steps? This is an emergency and they should be immediately transported to a hospital for potential percutanous coronary intervention in the cardiac catheterization lab. En route, the patient should receive: 1. Beta-blocker such as metoprolol (antianginal) 2. Sublingual nitroglycerin if they are having chest pain (another antianginal). 3. Aspirin (antiplatelet) 4. An additional anti-platelet agent such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor. 5. Heparin (anti-thrombin) After undergoing appropriate intervention, and ECG is repeated and is shown below: Question 3 What are the differences between this ECG and the initial one? The ECG is evolving. There are now: 1. Q waves in the precordial leads (indicating necrosis). These were not present in the initial ECG because it that was taken early in the acute MI, prior to this level of cardiac injury. 2. ST elevations in the precordial leads, while persistent, are much smaller 3. There are now T wave inversions in the precordial leads. Question 4 Which coronary artery was likely involved in this presentation? The left anterior descending artery, because it supplies the anterior wall. Notably, its branches supply the lateral wall and septum. 2  8-Answers \\nExercise 2 A 67 year-old patient experienced indigestion after eating lunch. They took an antacid and felt somewhat better, but 2 hours later, the epigastric pain returned, radiating upward to their jaw. The paramedics were called and performed the following ECG: Question 1 What is the diagnosis? This is an inferior STEMI.There are ST elevations and Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF.Notice the reciprocal ST depressions in I and aVL, as well as V1-V2. This ECG also shows first degree AV block (prolonged PR interval). Question 2 Which coronary artery was likely involved in this presentation? The right coronary artery, which is responsible for ~80% of inferior ST elevation MI\\'s.  8-Answers 3 \\nExercise 3 A 63 year-old patient presents to the emergency department for evaluation of severe chest discomfort that woke them from sleep. The pain gradually resolved over 5 minutes, but symptoms recurred several minutes later. They have felt generally unwell for the past few days. Examination findings include a temperature of 38.1°C, and HR of 104 bpm. Heart sounds (S1 and S2) are normal, but coarse rales are heard over the sternum, and jugular venous pressure is normal. Pertinent laboratory tests include a normal Troponin-I, elevated WBC of 12,000/uL, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 55 mm/hr. An ECG is performed: Question 1 What is the differential and the most likely diagnosis for this presentation? The history and ECG are highly concerning for a MI.However, the ST elevations are diffuse (i.e., in all leads) with no reciprocal ST depressions. There are also diffuse PR despressions. This is acute pericarditis. The coarse crackles heard over the sternum are indicative of a pericardial friction rub. The fever, WBC, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (a general marker of inflammation) are indicative of an inflammatory state. 4  8-Answers \\nExercise 4 A 56 year-old patient experienced sudden onset of substernal chest discomfort at work, appearing diaphoretic, and pale to their coworkers. The paramedics were called and obtained the ECG shown below: Question 1 What is the diagnosis? This is an inferior STEMI.There are ST elevations and Q waves in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). There are reciprocal ST depressions in leads V1-V2. Question 2 Which coronary artery is most likely involved in this presentation? The right coronary artery is most likely involved - it is responsible for ~80% of inferior STEMIs.  8-Answers 5 \\nWhile transporting the patient to the hospital, the paramedics perform a right-sided ECG by placing the precordial leads on the right side of the chest: Question 3 What is the significant finding on this ECG? How does this affect your management? This ECG shows ST elevations in V3R-V6R.These findings, especially V4R, indicate right ventricular ischemia. Because the right ventricle is affected, its contractility may be reduced, thereby making it more dependent on preload to maintain stroke volume. Nitrates decrease preload by potent venous vasodilation and should therefore be avoided here. Instead, IV fluids can be used to help augment RV preload, thereby maintaining stroke volume. 6  8-Answers \\nExercise 5 A 60 year-old patient reports substernal discomfort with exertion for 4 weeks. These are new symptoms that have not changed in intensity nor frequency since first noticed. You order an exercise treadmill test. The patient develops chest tightness after 6 minutes on the treadmill and had to stop, at which point a stress ECG was taken. The resting and stress ECGs are shown below. Of note, the resting ECG is unchanged compared to one performed 10 years prior. Resting ECG: Stress ECG:  8-Answers 7 \\nQuestion 1 What are the findings in the resting ECG? The resting ECG shows normal sinus rhythm with normal axis. Question 2 What are the significant findings in the stress ECG? The stress ECG was taken while the patient was experiencing angina. It shows sinus tachycardia 2 mm ST depressions in the inferior and lateral leads reciprocal ST elevation in aVR.Question 3 What are your recommendations? In answering, recall that the Duke score is used for risk stratification: Duke Score = (Number of minutes) - (5 x ST depression in mm) - (4 x angina index) where the angina index is 0 for none, 1 for non-limiting angina, and 2 for limiting angina. Because the patient could only exercise for 6 minutes, had 2 mm ST depressions, and the test was stopped due to limiting angina, their Duke score is 6-(5x2)-(4x2) = -12. Referring to Syllabus Table 13-3, patients with moderate (-10 to +4) or high (<-10) Duke scores should proceed to angiography. Thus, this test indicates that the patient is high risk and should be referred for coronary angiography. 8  8-Answers \\nExercise 6 A 76 year-old patient presents to you to establish care. On past medical history, they report a \"heart procedure\" 2 years ago but do not remember the details. The patient experiences \"twinges\" in their chest from time to time that are not associated with exertion. They notice them at night while watching television. You perform an ECG, and it looks similar to the one from last year. Question 1 What are the major findings? What do they suggest? The ECG shows sinus bradycardia at 54 bpm. There are Q waves and T wave inversions in II, III, and aVF.Q waves can be a normal variant or they can be an abnormal (or \"pathologic\") finding. If q waves are found in contiguous leads (ie in the same territory) then they are considered pathologic. For this patient, there are Q waves in the inferior territory. This, addition to the T wave inversions also in the inferior territory, is highly suggestive of a prior inferior MI. 8-Answers 9 \\nExercise 7 A 64 year-old patient with a history of smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia presents to the Emergency Department with substernal chest discomfort (\"like someone is tightening a belt around my chest\") and nausea. Symptoms began two hours prior to presentation. An ECG was performed and is shown below: Question 1 What are the major findings and the differential diagnosis? Major findings are T wave inversions in the anterior and lateral leads, suggesting myocardial injury. There are no ST elevations. This is history and presentation is consistent with acute coronary syndrome. Highest on the differential should be unstable angina or myocardial infarction (NSTEMI or STEMI). If troponin level rises (which may be too early to see here), this is a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). Otherwise it is unstable angina. 10  8-Answers \\nExercise 8 A 70 year-old patient presents to the ED with a worsening back pain, which began 24 hours ago, and has not been relieved with acetaminophen. Past medical history is remarkable for hypertension and a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction five years ago, which was treated with coronary stenting at another hospital. No prior ECGs are available for review. Laboratory testing, including troponin-I, and is normal. Their ECG is shown below: Question 1 What is the most likely diagnosis? The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB). The LBBB pattern is consistent with the patient\\'s cardiac history of prior MI and hypertension. Although the presentation of back pain for 24 hours is concerning for an atypical presentation of MI, the LBBB makes diagnosing an MI (with or without ST elevations) difficult. A prior ECG is required to know if this is a new versus chronic LBBB.A new LBBB in the setting of a history consistent with ACS and supportive laboratory testing (if the history is equivocal) is an indication for immediate coronary angiography. In this case, the patient\\'s history is equivocal because the LBBB could be due to the prior history of an NSTEMI.Troponin is also normal in the setting of symptoms that began 24 hours ago (troponin peaks at 24 hours after the onset of MI). Thus, the patient does not have ACS and further workup must be completed to determine the diagnosis.  8-Answers 11 \\nExercise 9 Describe the distribution of the infarction in the ECG below. What is the most likely \"culprit\" coronary artery. This is an anterior STEMI.For an anterior myocardial infarction, the LAD artery is often the occluded vessel. 12  8-Answers \\n CPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 7: Answers to Pulmonary Vascular Diseases Cases Day: 25 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 71 year-old woman is brought into the emergency room after she was found to be tachypneic and hypoxemic by the staff at her skilled nursing facility. She had recently been admitted to the hospital following a fall during which she suffered a pelvic fracture and multiple left-sided rib fractures. The pelvic fracture was repaired in the operating room on hospital day #2 and, following a 2-day stay in the ICU and then another 5 days on the acute care service, she was discharged to the skilled nursing facility where she has been for the past week. She had problems with confusion (delirium) during her hospital stay that have slowly been resolving but making it difficult to obtain further history from her. The nursing notes from the skilled nursing facility state that she was participating in her rehabilitation work, was eating okay with some occasional coughing after swallowing and had not had any fevers or change in her pain medication needs. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for about 40 years but has not smoked since she was admitted to the hospital. Vital Signs: T 36.9°C BP 112/66 HR 120 RR 28 SpO2: 92% breathing ambient air Physical Examination: General: Thin, anxious appearing woman with mild tachypnea and no accessory muscle use Chest: Clear to auscultation, resonant to percussion throughout, no pleural friction rub Heart: Rapid rate, regular rhythm. No murmur, rubs, S3 or S4. JVP ~ 8 cm Abdomen: Non-distended. Soft, non-tender, no rebound or guarding Extremities: Bilateral lower extremity edema: 2+ on the left, trace-1+ on the right. Skin: No rash 1. What is your differential diagnosis? What initial labs and studies would you like to order? The differential diagnosis for acute tachypnea and hypoxemia is broad. Given that she recently had repair of a hip fracture and has asymmetric lower extremity edema, venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism) would be the leading item on the differential diagnosis. Given her recent rib fractures, one would consider pneumothorax or hemothorax but it would be uncommon for these to develop this far out from her injury. Pneumonia would also be a concern given that the pain associated with rib fractures impairs cough and secretion clearance. Her age and smoking history put her at risk for myocardial infarction, while her recent hospitalization, including the rib fractures, puts her at high risk for pneumonia. The fact that she coughs with eating would raise concern she may be aspirating with meals, which could predispose to aspiration pneumonia. The lack of fever does not rule out pneumonia in a patient in her age range. Finally, she is a long-term user of tobacco and even though you are not told she has a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the case vignette, it is possible that she has as yet unrecognized COPD and is now having an exacerbation. The absence of wheezing on exam makes this less likely. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) For patients who present with acute dyspnea and hypoxemia, the appropriate initial evaluation includes basic laboratory studies (chemistry panel, complete blood count, urinalysis, cardiac troponin, B-type natriuretic peptide), a plain chest radiograph, arterial blood gas and electrocardiogram. Even though pulmonary embolism is on the differential, you would not order a CT Pulmonary Angiogram until you saw the results of the other studies, as these initial tests might reveal an alternative diagnosis and obviate the need for the CT scan and its associated cost and radiation exposure. Studies: Complete Blood Count: WBC 7.0 x 103 cells/uL Hematocrit: 38% Chemistry Panel: Sodium 136 mEq/L Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL Troponin: 0.01 ng/mL Arterial blood gas: FIO2 0.21 pH 7.41 Chest Radiograph: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) 39 63 HCO3- (mmol/L) 23 Electrocardiogram: 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 1 (continued) 2. Based on these initial results, outline an appropriate strategy for further diagnostic evaluation? Several items are less likely based on the results of these initial studies. Given the lack of fever, the normal white blood cell count, and the lack of focal opacities, pneumonia is unlikely. The absence of ST-segment changes on the ECG and the normal cardiac troponin make myocardial infarction unlikely. The chest radiograph also shows no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. The absence of wheezing on exam makes a COPD exacerbation less likely. Venous thromboembolism remains on the differential and cannot be ruled out based on these initial studies. As a result, further diagnostic studies are indicated. The most appropriate step would be to proceed to a CT Pulmonary Angiogram or a Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) scan. Both are valid diagnostic tools to use but the reality these days is that CT Pulmonary Angiography is used much more frequently than the V/Q scan. If she had abnormal renal function and could not tolerate IV contrast with the CT scan, a V/Q scan would be done instead. Another reasonable first step would be to obtain a venous duplex ultrasound to evaluate for lower extremity DVT given her asymmetric lower extremity swelling. Finding evidence of DVT in the lower or upper extremities would significantly increase the likelihood that the chest symptoms are related to venous thromboembolism, warrants the same treatment as pulmonary embolism and spares the patient the risk of radiation and contrast administration with CT angiography. Note that a D-dimer is not part of the work-up in this case. In patients with a low-moderate pre-test probability for pulmonary embolism, a negative D-dimer can be used to rule out venous thromboembolism and no further work-up is needed. This patient, however, likely has a moderate-high pre-test probability of having pulmonary embolism given her clear risk factor - a very recent hip fracture and surgical repair - and her asymmetric lower extremity edema. With a high pre-test probability as you have in this case, the D-dimer has no diagnostic utility and should not be ordered. 3. What is the most likely cause of her hypoxemia? How do you account for this given the likely diagnosis? Given that she is not hypoventilating and has an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, the patient has shunt and/or low VA/Q as the cause of her hypoxemia. You are not provided any information about the response to supplemental oxygen so you cannot distinguish between those two processes. As noted above, the most likely cause of this patient\\'s presentation is pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism actually causes dead-space physiology (ventilation without perfusion: there\\'s no perfusion to a lung unit because the vasculature is blocked by the embolus). You will recall from the large group sessions Chapter 6 (Why Is This Patient Hypoxemic), that, in and of itself, dead space does not cause hypoxemia. In fact, the alveolar PO2 in dead space units is higher than normal and approaches that of inspired air. The question then becomes how low VA/Q or shunt can develop in this situation and lead to hypoxemia. The reason is as follows: the entire cardiac output has to go through the lungs unless there is an intracardiac right-to-left shunt. If the vasculature in a given lung region is occluded by an embolus, blood flow is diverted to other regions of the lung. This increases the perfusion of these regions (without a change in their ventilation) causing a change in their VA/Q ratios such that you now have more low VA/Q units. Overall, there is more heterogeneity in VA/Q ratios across the lung, which you recall is associated with worsening gas exchange and hypoxemia. This is demonstrated in the figure on the next page. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 3 \\nCase 1 (continued) 4 The arrows represent the relative amount of ventilation and perfusion of each unit. This phenomenon does not always happen and some patients may remain normoxemic (normal PaO2). The implication is that if a patient has a history consistent with venous thromboembolism but remains normoxemic, you cannot rule out the possibility of pulmonary embolism based on the normal PaO2 and must pursue further testing. 4. The patient has a high respiratory rate at the time the blood gas is drawn. If we assume she is taking normal volume breaths, her minute ventilation is also higher than normal. How can she have an essentially normal PaCO2 despite this high minute ventilation? Recall that minute ventilation is the sum of alveolar ventilation and dead-space ventilation. VV!=VV\"+VV#̇ Pulmonary embolism causes an increase in dead-space. The normal response to such a change is to increase minute ventilation to compensate for the increase in dead-space and maintain alveolar ventilation. This is the same as would happen if you were asked to breathe in and out of a long cardboard tube held to your mouth, as this tube increases the volume of your anatomic dead space. If minute ventilation increases by the same amount that dead- space ventilation increases, then alveolar ventilation remains constant and the PaCO2 remains constant as well. Other situations can also be seen in pulmonary embolism. For example, supposed dead- space ventilation increased due to venous thromboembolism but the patient cannot not raise her minute ventilation in response (e.g., she was on a ventilator with a fixed minute ventilation because she was receiving neuromuscular blockade agents, i.e., pharmacologic paralysis). Alveolar ventilation would fall and the PaCO2 would increase. Alternatively, suppose the dead-space ventilation increased due to a venous thromboembolism but the patient raised their minute ventilation by more than the amount of the increase in dead- space ventilation because chest pain from the pulmonary embolism led to increased anxiety. In that case, alveolar ventilation would increase and the PaCO2 would go down. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 2 A 27 year-old woman comes to clinic for follow-up from an emergency department visit following an episode of syncope with exercise. This came after six months of increasing dyspnea on exertion and recent onset of lightheadedness with exertion. She has a history of asthma for which she has been using inhaled fluticasone and salmeterol for the past two years. She has known aspirin sensitivity but has not had problems with exercise-induced bronchospasm. She is worried because she was told that three of her mother\\'s cousins died at a young age of what she understands to be some kind of heart problem. Physical Examination: Height: 66 inches Weight: 155 lbs. SpO2: 93-94% at rest. Decreases to 89% with ambulation General: Overweight, in no apparent distress, talking in complete sentences Lungs: Scattered expiratory wheezes, normal duration of expiration Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmur, S2 split normally, loud P2, RV heave Extremities: No lower extremity edema Pulmonary Function Testing: Predicted Measured % Predicted DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) Her arterial blood gas done while breathing ambient air showed: pH 7.40 PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 28 65 - (mmol/L) 17 The chest radiograph performed in the emergency department showed the following: Parameter FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/VC TLC (Liters) 4.50 4.05 0.90 6.25 28.60 3.96 2.46 0.62 5.20 13.10 88 61 N/A 83 45 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 5 \\nThe FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced, consistent with the presence of airflow obstruction. The TLC is normal indicating the patient does not have a restrictive process. The DLCO is reduced indicating that there is a loss of surface area for gas exchange. A reduced DLCO is not typically seen in asthma, as asthma is a disorder that affects the airways and does not affect alveoli. As a result, the alveolar-capillary barrier is normal and the surface area available for gas exchange is preserved. Hence, the DLCO should be normal in patients with asthma. There are some other aspects of her presentation that are also not seen in patients with asthma, including the lightheadedness or syncope with exertion, the decrease in her oxygen saturation with ambulation and the loud P2 and RV heave on cardiac examination. 2. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? The chest radiograph shows cardiomegaly with a prominent right atrial shadow and large pulmonary arteries bilaterally (the large left pulmonary artery is seen as a convexity at the upper portion of the left heart border in the area). These findings are suggestive of right- sided heart enlargement and pulmonary hypertension. The lateral film (not provided here) might show evidence of a decreased retrosternal air space. 3. What testing or further evaluation should you do at this time? Many of the findings described above are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, of which there are many possible causes (described below). Her presentation, as noted above, is not entirely consistent with asthma so this would be much lower on the differential diagnosis. A left-sided cardiomyopathy leading to pulmonary hypertension would be a consideration but she has no evidence of this on exam or other studies at this point. If you suspect the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, the most appropriate first diagnostic step is to order an echocardiogram to confirm the presence of elevated pulmonary artery pressures. If the echocardiogram shows elevated estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure, you would then order a series of tests designed to determine the etiology of the problem. Pulmonary artery catheterization is the gold standard for measuring pulmonary artery pressure but it is an invasive test and echocardiography remains the preferred initial test. Case 2 (Continued) 1. How would you interpret the pulmonary function tests? 6 As noted in the chapter and large group session on Pulmonary Vascular Physiology and Pathophysiology, there are 5 broad categories of causes of pulmonary hypertension shown in the table below: The goal of testing is to identify the category into which the patient falls, as this affects prognosis and treatment. The tests to order include: pulmonary function testing if not already done to rule out parenchymal disease, an arterial blood gas to rule out chronic hypoventilation, a ventilation-perfusion scan to rule out chronic thromboembolism (V/Q scan is better for chronic PE than CT pulmonary angiography), an overnight polysomnogram (i.e., sleep study), a CT scan of the chest to evaluate for parenchymal disease and laboratory studies to rule out diseases that can be associated with pulmonary hypertension like scleroderma, HIV or chronic liver disease. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) Category Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) Group 2: Left Heart Disease Group 3: Lung Diseases Group 4: Chronic thromboembolism Group 5: Miscellaneous Mechanism Increased PVR due to narrowing and occlusion of pulmonary arterioles due to smooth muscle proliferation and vessel wall thickening (medial hypertrophy, intimal hyperplasia) Left ventricular or left-sided valvular disease increase pulmonary venous pressure Destruction of the capillary network and decrease in cross-sectional area for blood flow leading to higher vascular resistance Chronic alveolar hypoxia leads to ongoing HPV and increased PVR Chronic accumulation of endothelialized thrombus decreases cross sectional area for blood flow and increased PVR Obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature due to mediastinal inflammation around the vessels or mechanical compression Examples Idiopathic PAH Collagen vascular disease HIV Cardiomyopathy Mitral regurgitation Severe COPD Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Obesity hypoventilation High altitude residence Recurrent pulmonary embolism Tumor embolism Sarcoidosis Fibrosing mediastinitis 4. The remainder of her diagnostic work-up was unrevealing. A right heart catheterization was performed and revealed the following data: Parameter PA Pressure (mm Hg) Mean PA Pressure (mm Hg) PCWP (mm Hg) Right atrial pressure (mm Hg) Value 70/43 52 5 8 Parameter Cardiac Output (L/min) PA Pressure on FIO2 1.0 Oximetry Value 7 69/40 No Shunt * PCWP: pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; PA: pulmonary artery How do you interpret the data from the right heart catheterization? What treatment would you start the patient on at this time? The right heart catheterization confirms the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Her mean PA pressure is 52 mm Hg, which is well above the World Health Organization (WHO) threshold for this diagnosis (mean PA pressure > 25 mm Hg). Her pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) is only 5 mm Hg, suggesting that left-heart problems are not contributing to her pulmonary hypertension. If you were to calculate her PVR using the flow equation as it applies to the pulmonary circulation: PPVVPP\\t=\\t[mmmmmmmm\\tPPPPPP\\t-\\t__LPPPP]\\t CCmmCCCCCCmmCC\\tOOOOOOOOOOOO you would also calculate a high pulmonary vascular resistance. This indicates that high resistance, rather than high left atrial pressure and high pulmonary hydrostatic pressure, is the problem. At this point, you have confirmed the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (WHO category 1 disease). Because diagnostic testing has not revealed a specific etiology, she would be diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. Given the extensive family history of similar problems, this may be a case of familial pulmonary arterial hypertension. In either case, according to WHO criteria, she is considered as having Group I pulmonary arterial CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) hypertension, and, as such, she should be treated with pulmonary vasodilators. Several classes of medications are used for this purpose Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (oral): Amlodipine or nifedipine Phosphodiesterase-5 Inhibitors (oral): Tadalafil, sildenafil Endothelin-receptor antagonists (oral): Bosentan, ambrisentan, macetentan Prostacyclin analogues: Epoprostenol (IV), treprostinil (subcutaneous or inhaled) or iloprost (inhaled). The choice of agent depends on a variety of factors including their response to pulmonary vasodilators during the right heart catheterization and their New York Heart Association (NYHA) class functional limitation. These details are beyond the scope of this course. In general, though, the more severe the disease or the more rapid the progression, the greater the likelihood the patient will need intravenous or subcutaneous therapy rather than oral. Patients deemed to fall within other WHO categories generally do not get placed on pulmonary vasodilators and, instead, receive treatment appropriate for those categories. For example, in patients with left heart disease (WHO Group 2), the primary goal is treatment of their left heart disease whereas for WHO group 3 patients (e.g., very severe COPD or IPF) supplemental oxygen is used to raise the alveolar PO2 and suppress hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. 5. Why was she developing light-headedness and syncope with exercise? One of the key features of the pulmonary vasculature is its capacity for recruitment and distention. As pulmonary blood flow increases during exercise, previously closed vessels are recruited while previously underutilized vessels distend and accept more blood. This causes a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. As a result, despite the increase in pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary artery pressure increases to only a small extent as cardiac output increases (black line in the figure below). 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, however, lack the ability to recruit and distend the vasculature with exercise. This occurs because of a phenomenon known as \"pruning of the vascular tree.\" Due to the characteristic histopathologic changes in the pulmonary arterioles (plexiform arteriopathy, medial thickening, intimal hyperplasia) many of the small vascular channels are plugged off and receive little to no flow. Because the entire cardiac output must go through the pulmonary circulation, the remaining patent vessels are already recruited and distended at rest just to accommodate the normal flow. During exercise, there is no further capacity to recruit and distend vasculature as cardiac output increases; pulmonary vascular resistance does not fall as it does in a healthy individual. Because pulmonary vascular resistance does not decline as expected, pulmonary artery pressure rises significantly as pulmonary blood flow increases during exercise (blue line in the figure above). Note that the pulmonary artery pressure response for an individual with pulmonary arterial hypertension (blue line) will vary between patients depending on the severity of their disease. The key issue is the qualitative difference relative to a normal individual. This large rise in pulmonary artery pressure leads to a significant increase in right ventricular afterload and a decrease in right ventricular function. If the right ventricle cannot pump enough blood through the high resistance pulmonary vasculature to the left side of the heart, the left ventricular preload is insufficient to generate adequate cardiac output to support exercising muscles and still perfuse other organs such as the brain. Another factor that contributes to inadequate LV preload is that with the rise in pulmonary artery pressure, the right ventricle dilates significantly. This pushes the interventricular septum into the left ventricle, thereby decreasing the space in the LV to accept blood flow coming from the pulmonary veins and left atrium (see the figure below). This decreases left ventricular preload, which impairs cardiac output. Decreased blood flow to the brain manifests as lightheadedness and, when severe enough, syncope (temporary loss of consciousness). Syncope with exercise is a marker of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Another symptom often reported by patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension is chest pain with exertion. This occurs because of CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 9 \\nsubendocardial ischemia that develops due to right ventricular dilation and decreased subendocardial blood flow during exercise. 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 3 A 55 year-old man presents to the pulmonary clinic for evaluation of dyspnea that has been worsening over a several year period. He describes mild dyspnea at rest that is markedly worsened with exertion. On review of systems, he denies cough, hemoptysis or chest pain but does note that his breathing feels worse when he is in the seated or standing position compared to lying down. His past medical history is noteworthy for the fact that he had a brain abscess five years ago for which he was treated with a long course of antibiotics and which left him with persistent left upper extremity weakness. Physical Examination: Vitals: Afebrile BP 128/90 HR 84 RR 22 SpO2: supine: 94, standing: 86% General: awake, alert, mildly dyspneic during the interview HEENT: See image on left below Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.

What is the primary cause of the patient\\'s hypoxemia? Can you account for this based on what you see in the chest radiograph? The PaCO2 is low indicating that hypoventilation does not contribute to his hypoxemia. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference is increased on the blood gas drawn while he is breathing ambient air indicating that he has either shunt and/or low VA/Q as the cause of his hypoxemia. Although his PaO2 does increase somewhat with supplemental oxygen, it does not increase nearly as much as you would expect when breathing an FIO2 of 1.0, indicating that shunt is the primary cause of his hypoxemia. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference is markedly elevated on an FIO2 of 1.0, indicating that his shunt fraction is quite large. At first glance, the chest radiograph does not show a large opacity that could explain this magnitude of shunt. The right lung field is clear and there appears to be only a mild left base opacity. However, on close inspection, there is a subtle, but important finding that may be contributing to his shunt: there is a retrocardiac density that is not easy to characterize based on the plain film. It is circled in the image below. 12 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\n Case 3 (continued) 2. How do you account for the PaCO2 observed on the initial arterial blood gas? Why did the PaCO2 rise when he was put on supplemental oxygen? The PaCO2 is low, indicating that the patient has hyperventilation. In other words, his alveolar ventilation is greater than that needed to eliminate the CO2 he is producing through his metabolic activity. While hyperventilation can occur for many reasons, such as anxiety, in this case, it is probably due to his arterial hypoxemia (hypoxic ventilatory response mediated by the peripheral chemoreceptors). With supplemental oxygen administration, his PaO2 has increased enough that carotid body stimulation decreases and the hypoxic ventilatory response is diminished. As a result, minute and, therefore, alveolar ventilation decrease. 3. A saline contrast echocardiogram was performed. What information does this study provide for us? On saline contrast echocardiography, 10 mL of saline is agitated in a syringe and injected through a peripheral IV or central line. The bubbles travel to the right side of the heart and then into the pulmonary circulation. In normal individuals, the bubbles are too big to get through the pulmonary vasculature. They should all be filtered out by the pulmonary capillary network and not visualized on the left side of the heart. If a patient has some form of right-to-left communication, some of the bubbles \"escape\" this filter and appear on the left side of the heart. When the bubbles make it from the right to the left side in only 1-2 cardiac cycles, the patient is deemed to have an intracardiac shunt (e.g., a patent foramen ovale). If, however, it takes 4-5 cardiac cycles for the bubbles to appear on the left side of the heart, the patient has an intrapulmonary shunt. In this particular case, the bubbles appear on the right side of the heart after 4-5 beats and he has an intrapulmonary shunt. Subsequent imaging revealed that the patient had an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which is circled in the CT images below. This was actually the retrocardiac density seen on the chest radiograph. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 13 \\nCase 3 (continued) 4. Why does the patient\\'s oxygen saturation fall and his dyspnea worsen when he is in the standing position? Dyspnea that is worse upon assuming the standing upright position is referred to as platypnea while a change in oxygen saturation with changes in positioning is referred to as orthodeoxia. This patient\\'s AVM is located in the basilar region of his left lung. When he stands up, more blood flow goes to this region and, as a result, he sends more blood flow through the AVM and his shunt fraction increases. It is important to remember that, as discussed in the Chapter 13, blood flow in the lungs is not entirely determined by gravity as implied in the original West Zone model of pulmonary blood flow. Instead, there are fixed anatomic relationships that persist regardless of patient positioning. Nevertheless, there is some gravitational component to blood flow and, in this case, it is responsible for his platypnea and orthodeoxia. 5. How can you relate his current respiratory findings to his brain abscess several years ago? One of the key functions of pulmonary capillary network is to filter out small blood clots and other pieces of material that make it into the venous circulation. An arteriovenous malformation is a large avenue of communication between the right and left sides of the circulation that undermines this filter function. As a result, it provides a route for blood clots or infectious material to move from the venous to the arterial side of the circulation. When a deep venous thrombosis migrates and makes it to the left side of the circulation through such a communication, it is referred to as a paradoxical embolus. In this patient\\'s case, he has had his AVM for a while (they do not develop suddenly). He likely had some small piece of infected material that entered his blood stream, traveled to his lungs, moved through his AVM to the systemic side of the circulation, and eventually made it to the cerebral vasculature, lodging in his brain. This is a known complication of pulmonary AVMs and one of the reasons that patients with known AVMs are followed closely to determine when they need to go to interventional radiology to embolize their AVM.This patient had successful embolization. 14 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 4 A 20 year-old man presents to the emergency department stating that he has been coughing up blood since waking up in the morning. He estimates that he has produced about two cups of blood since that time and while sitting in triage fills half of a kidney basin with blood while the nurse is taking his vital signs. He reports having frequent sinus infections and pneumonias in the past and has had dyspnea on exertion and a cough productive of thick sputum for several years. He has never had hemoptysis before. He has engaged in sexual intercourse with multiple partners and does not always use condoms. He occasionally smokes cigarettes but denies other drug use. He has been estranged from his parents for several years. He did not graduate from high school, is currently unemployed and lives with multiple friends in a large house. Physical Examination: Vitals: Afebrile BP 113/76 HR 105 RR 25 SpO2: 95% breathing ambient air General: awake, alert, talking in complete sentences. HEENT: No icterus. Dried blood around his nares. Lungs: Prolonged expiratory phase. Scattered expiratory wheezes. Resonant to percussion throughout both lung fields. Symmetric chest expansion. No accessory muscle use. Cardiac: Rapid rate, regular rhythm. No murmur. Musculoskeletal: Digital clubbing. Decreased muscle mass in all extremities. Chest Radiograph CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 15 \\nCase 4 (continued) 1. How would you describe the lung fields in this patient\\'s chest radiograph? What clues do these findings provide regarding the etiology of his hemoptysis? The lung fields demonstrate diffuse opacities affecting the apical and basilar regions of both lungs, with relative sparing of the right lower lung zone. In the apical regions of the right lung there are ring-like structures with thick walls. Similar structures are seen in the apical region of the left lung as well as another tubular-appearing structure with thick walls that look as if they are train tracks. These are highlighted in the reproduction of the chest radiograph below. These structures are airways and, in particular, dilated airways with thickened walls, a finding known as bronchiectasis. Several clues in the clinical stem suggest that this patient may have undiagnosed cystic fibrosis (CF), a leading cause of bronchiectasis. While nearly all patients with bronchiectasis have a chronic cough productive of copious sputum from chronic airway inflammation, patients with CF also frequently have recurrent sinopulmonary infections, a low body mass index, and digital clubbing. CF is typically diagnosed early in childhood, but less common genetic variants can present later in life. This patient\\'s socioeconomic status may have also delayed his access to care to determine the cause of his chronic symptoms. Even if he was diagnosed and treated earlier in life, he may have lost contact with the healthcare system and, as a result, may no longer be adherent to his treatment regimen. 2. Which of the pulmonary vascular supplies is the most likely source of the bleeding? What implications does this have for the patient\\'s clinical course? The lungs receive blood supply from two sources, the pulmonary circulation and the bronchial circulation. In general, despite receiving much less blood flow than the pulmonary circulation, the bronchial circulation is actually the more common source of hemoptysis. While, hemoptysis does occur due to parenchymal (e.g., pneumonia or an autoimmune disease) or vascular (e.g., pulmonary embolism, arteriovenous malformations) problems, the most common causes of hemoptysis are related to airway pathology (bronchiectasis, bronchitis, neoplasms) and, as noted in the HFF thread for this course, the airways receive their blood supply from the bronchial circulation. 16 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 4 (continued) Patients with bronchiectasis are prone to develop hemoptysis because the bronchial circulation hypertrophies due to chronic airway inflammation and infection. Ongoing inflammatory responses can cause erosion into one of the bronchial vessels, leading to bleeding into the airway. A similar phenomenon of bronchial circulation hypertrophy leading to hemoptysis is also seen in other suppurative lung diseases, such as TB, pulmonary abscesses and mycetomas. An example of bronchial artery hypertrophy is shown in the figure below. You will not be responsible for interpreting images like this on any exams. It is only there to demonstrate the point about bronchial circulation hypertrophy for your learning interest. Note that the bronchial artery (coming off the aorta and denoted by the blue arrow) is as large as the subclavian artery (black arrow). This is not normally the case. As you will recall from HFF, the bronchial arteries are typically quite small. The fact that the bronchial circulation is most common source hemoptysis, in general, and the likely culprit in this case is clinically significant because, unlike the low-pressure pulmonary arterial circulation, the bronchial circulation is under systemic arterial pressure. As a result, when bleeding occurs from this circulation, there is the potential to put a significant volume of blood into the airways. 3. What factors should be weighed in determining which patients presenting with hemoptysis warrant diagnostic work-up and the pace at which that evaluation should proceed? Once you confirm that blood is coming from the airway rather than the nose (epistaxis) or gastrointestinal tract (hematemesis), the most important next step is to determine how much blood is being expectorated. Patients coughing up large volumes of blood (e.g., 200-600 mL of blood in a 24-hour period) are deemed to have \"massive hemoptysis\" while those who CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers 17 \\nCase 4 (continued) produce smaller amounts (e.g., blood-tinged sputum, dime-sized amounts of blood) are labeled as having \"non-massive hemoptysis.\" There is no specific volume of blood used to distinguish between the two categories of hemoptysis, as the criteria for making this determination vary throughout the literature. In general, you will recognize the appropriate categorization from the patient\\'s description of the volume of expectorated blood or your observation of their hemoptysis. Patients deemed to have massive hemoptysis warrant immediate admission to the hospital and an expedited evaluation. Patients with non-massive hemoptysis warrant evaluation on a less urgent basis as an outpatient. Diagnostic work-up may be deferred in patients under age 40 who are non- smokers, have a normal chest radiograph and whose hemoptysis has been going on for less than 2 weeks. These are all features suggestive of a benign cause of hemoptysis, such as bronchitis following a viral infection. Patients who do not meet those criteria, whose hemoptysis persists or who have other features suggestive of malignancy or underlying systemic disease, should undergo further evaluation in a relatively expeditious manner. 4. What are your initial management priorities in patients with this degree of hemoptysis? There are three priorities in patients with large volumes of hemoptysis: (1) protect the non- bleeding lung; (2) identify the source of hemoptysis; and (3) stop the bleeding. Patients with hemoptysis do not die from exsanguination, as can happen with gastrointestinal bleeding or following trauma. Instead, the major cause of death is asphyxiation. Blood fills the airways and alveoli, making it difficult for the patient to ventilate and oxygenate adequately. For that reason, an immediate priority is to keep the airways clear of blood and prevent spillage of blood into the healthy lung. Patients who are awake and alert and have an intact cough mechanism (i.e., no neuromuscular or central nervous system disease) usually do a good job of expectorating the blood on their own. As a result, you should not automatically intubate them, as they will do a better job coughing blood out of the airways than we can do suctioning the airways through an endotracheal tube. If patients do require intubation, special techniques can be used to isolate the two lungs and prevent blood from crossing from one side to the other. These specific practices are beyond the scope of this course. If imaging studies provide clues to the location of the bleeding, patients can be placed with the affected side of their chest down, whereby gravity helps keep the blood from going into the other lung. The next priority is to identify the region of the lung from which the blood is coming. Plain chest radiography is the first step in this process and, depending on the patient\\'s clinical stability, a CT scan of the chest may also be performed. In patients with diffuse lung disease, as seen in this case, chest imaging may not reveal the specific the location of the bleeding. In such cases or other cases where the imaging is unrevealing, airway inspection using flexible or rigid bronchoscopy is used to identify the bleeding source (e.g., a tumor in the airway) or the airway from which blood is emanating. Localization of the bleeding source in this manner is important for addressing the other major priority - stopping the bleeding. Once the general location of the bleeding is identified, the patient is sent to Interventional Radiology for embolization of the bleeding vessel(s). If embolization is not feasible, the patient may require surgical resection of the bleeding 18 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 7 Answers \\nCase 4 (continued) portion of the lung if the bleeding is from a focal source. Neither approach is suitable for patients with a diffuse source of massive hemoptysis such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, in which case, bleeding is controlled by treating the underlying disease. Once embolization is completed, further management varies based on the cause of the bleeding. A patient with an airway tumor, such as a carcinoid tumor, for example, may require resection of the tumor. In this particular patient\\'s case, he has widespread bronchiectasis. Embolization will stop the bleeding on this particular occasion but the extensive bronchiectasis puts him at risk for further bleeding from other sites in the future. If not done already, he warrants a work-up to identify the underlying cause of his bronchiectasis and initiation of treatment to slow the progression of that problem. An algorithm for evaluating and managing hemoptysis is shown below (this is the same as in the syllabus chapter on this topic).

Normal subjects are enrolled in the study and asked to alter their alveolar ventilation to change their arterial gas composition. If blood flow (Q) remains the same and O2 removal from and CO2 delivery to the alveolus are constant, what will happen to the PAO2 and PACO2 as alveolar ventilation increases and decreases? Draw your estimates on the graph. Values for PAO2 and PACO2 have been placed on the graph at a normal ventilation of 5 L/min. As you fill in the graph, you should assume that the individuals reach a steady state at each level of alveolar ventilation. Recognize that alveolar ventilation cannot reach a steady state at 0 L/min as that particular steady state is referred to as \"death.\" Your curve should not extend to that level of alveolar ventilation. If blood flow (Q) in a given subject remains constant at 5 L/min, indicate the VA/Q ratios for the various minute ventilations on the horizontal axis. In the figure above, the trend in the PAO2 is shown by the open squares and the dotted line while the trend in the PACO2 is denoted by the black circles and solid line. The VA/Q ratios are displayed at the bottom of the figure. In general, gas tensions in the alveolus are determined by the balance between influx of the gas to the alveolus and efflux from the alveolus. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) For oxygen, the gas tension in the alveolus (PAO2) reflects a balance between the amount of oxygen delivered to the alveoli by alveolar ventilation on the one hand (influx) and what the body takes away to support its metabolic activity via cardiac output on the other (VO2, aka oxygen consumption; this is the efflux). To understand this, consider the following analogy. Imagine all the alveoli in the lungs are represented by a bathtub. For any bathtub, the water level is a function of what comes into the tub via the faucet and what leaves via the drain. For the lung, the faucet is the level of alveolar ventilation (VA). The drain is represented by the amount of oxygen consumption (VO2) and the cardiac output. The water level in the bathtub is the PAO2. At any point in time, the water level reflects the balance between what is coming in via alveolar ventilation (the faucet) and what is being taken away by oxygen consumption and cardiac output (the drain). In our case, oxygen removal from the alveolus is held constant (i.e., the drain continues working at the same rate). As a result, all changes in the PAO2 occur as a result of changes in ventilation. As ventilation increases (rightward movement along the x-axis), more oxygen is brought down to the alveolus. If more is brought down in the face of constant removal, the PAO2 rises. As ventilation decreases (left ward movement on the x- axis) less oxygen is brought down to the alveolus, which, in the setting of constant removal leads to a declining PAO2. This latter phenomenon is a key reason why hypoventilation contributes to the development of hypoxemia. The situation with alveolar CO2 can be conceptualized in a similar manner. The alveolar CO2 tension reflects a balance between how much CO2 is delivered to the alveoli via cardiac output (this is the CO2 production by the tissues) on the one hand and how much is taken away from the alveoli by alveolar ventilation on the other. We can apply the same bathtub analogy used above. 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers \\nCase 1 (continued) In this case, the faucet represents the amount of CO2 production and the cardiac output delivering CO2 to the alveoli while the drain in this case is the level of alveolar ventilation. As ventilation increases (rightward movement along the x-axis), more carbon dioxide is removed from the alveolus. If more is removed in the face of constant delivery to the alveolus by cardiac output, the PACO2 decreases. As ventilation decreases (left ward movement on the x-axis) less carbon dioxide is removed from the alveolus, which, in the setting of constant delivery to the alveolus leads to a rising PACO2. The above description is for a one-compartment lung, or a lung in which all of the alveoli have the same relationship between ventilation and blood flow. In reality, the lung is made up of a number of regions (also containing many alveoli) that have different relationships between ventilation and blood flow. In this multiple compartmental model, the various compartments have different relationships between the local ventilation and blood flow. Using the bathtub analogy, in the multiple compartment model, each region has it own bathtub in which the level of PAO2 and PACO2 are determined independently by their own VA/Q ratios. In reality, the lung has a distribution of VA/Q ratios. This distribution is largely centered on a VA/Q of 1.0 but does include some high and some low VA/Q regions. There are several things to note from this graph: Lung units with low VA/Q ratios tend to have low PAO2 values and high PACO2 values. Lung units with high VA/Q ratios will tend to have high PAO2 values and low PACO2. As discussed further in Chapter 6, the high alveolar partial pressures of oxygen in these lung VA/Q units cannot make up for the hypoxemia caused by the low VA/Q units.

On exam, the boy is breathing faster than normal and his hemoglobin-oxygen saturation is 90%. You appreciate air movement on both sides but his breath sounds are decreased on one side relative to the other and you hear focal wheezing on the side with the decreased breath sounds. The rest of the pulmonary exam is normal. 1. Consider the boy\\'s lungs as having two compartments. If the blood flow to each compartment is equal, how will the VA/Q ratio in each compartment compare to the child\\'s pre-aspiration VA/Q ratio? Note: In the answers that follow, left and right refer to the figure above. Prior to the aspiration event, both sides received equal amount of the cardiac output and equal amounts of ventilation. Therefore, they had the same VA/Q ratios. The boy aspirated a toy solider which went down the airway on the right in the simplified diagram above. Based on his exam, we know that he still has air movement on that side, although it is likely decreased given that the breath sounds are decreased relative to the other side and he has wheezing only on that side (in order to have wheezing, there must be at least some air movement). As a result, although that side is still getting ventilation, it is receiving less ventilation than the normal (left) side. Given that both sides receive equal amounts of the cardiac output, the VA/Q ratio will be higher on the left than on the right. Similarly, the VA/Q ratio on the right will be lower than prior to the aspiration since it is receiving less ventilation compared to before the event but the same portion of the cardiac output. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers 5 \\nCase 2 (continued) 2. How will the PAO2 and PACO2 differ in the two compartments? You will recall from Case 1 above that as the VA/Q ratio falls, the PAO2 decreases and the PACO2 increases. Therefore, we expect that the lung unit on the right in the figure will have a lower PAO2 and a higher PACO2 than the left. 3. Compare the partial pressures and contents of oxygen at points A and B? How will this affect the PaO2 and oxygen content when blood from the various alveolar regions combine in the left atrium? What will happen to the (A-a)ΔO2? The surface for gas exchange in the alveolus remains normal (remember, the toy is stuck in the airway and the downstream alveolus is unaffected). As a result, diffusion is normal and there is complete equilibration between the alveolar and capillary PO2 on both sides. Because the PAO2 is lower on the right side, the capillary PO2 and oxygen content are both lower at point B than at point A.When the blood from the left and right sides then mix in the left atrium, the lower PO2 and oxygen content from the right side lead to a lower PO2 and oxygen content of the arterial blood such that PaO2 and CaO2 are both lower than they were before the aspiration event. As a result of this, the difference between the expected normal alveolar partial pressure of O2 and the measured arterial partial pressure of O2 [(A-a)ΔO2 ] is widened compared to pre-aspiration. The calculated alveolar PO2 assumes that there is no VA/Q mismatch and is the same for all lung units. Prior to the aspiration event, capillary PO2 and oxygen content were equal on both sides. As a result, when mixing occurred in the left atrium, the arterial blood had the same PO2 and oxygen content as the capillary blood on both sides (in our simple model, we ignore the normal 5% physiologic shunt for the moment). Because capillary PO2 and alveolar PO2 are the same in the setting of normal diffusion, there would be no difference between the alveolar and arterial values (i.e., the (A-a)ΔO2 would be 0). Following the aspiration, mixing of the deoxygenated blood from the right side with the normal blood coming from the left side causes the PO2 to be lower than the capillary value on the left side and therefore, lower than the alveolar PO2. As a result, the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased. 4. The respiratory therapist gives the boy supplemental oxygen so that the FIO2 increases to 0.4 and the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation improves from 90% to 98%. In which of the two lung compartments is the end-capillary oxygen content (CcO2) increased the most? When the boy is placed on supplemental oxygen, the PAO2 increases on both sides. Remember, air is still getting through to the side with the toy soldier so it is possible for supplemental oxygen to get down to that alveolus. As a result of the higher PAO2, the capillary PO2 also increases on both sides. This leads to an increase in capillary oxygen content (CcO2) on both sides but the increase is relatively greater on the right side than on the left side. To see why, recall the determinants of oxygen content: CaO2 = (1.39 x [Hb] x SaO2) + (0.003 x PO2) 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) We can also recall the shape of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve and the fact that it is relatively flat when the PO2 is above 90 mm Hg (See Figure 2-8 in Chapter 2). This is because most of the hemoglobin binding sites are bound by oxygen and further increases in the PO2 do not increase binding to a significant extent. On the left side, the capillary PO2 increases when supplemental oxygen is provided but the blood in this unit was already near or on the flat portion of the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve prior to the supplemental oxygen and, as a result, overall content on that side does not increase much in response to any increase in the capillary PO2. On the right side, the story is different. Prior to the addition of supplemental oxygen, the PO2 was low as was oxygen content because many binding sites were unoccupied. This is the steep portion of the dissociation curve. As supplemental oxygen is provided, the PO2 rises and this, in turn, leads to more binding to the previously unoccupied hemoglobin binding sites and a significant increase in oxygen content. 5. Why is a child of this age at greater risk for the development of hypoxemia in this clinical scenario compared to an adolescent or adult? You will recall from Case 1 that the PAO2 is determined by the balance between how much oxygen is brought down to the alveolus on the one hand and how much is taken away to satisfy the oxygen consumption requirements of the body on the other. At rest, infants and young children have far higher metabolic activity and, therefore, higher oxygen consumption than adolescents and adults. This is particularly true in infants less than 1 year of age who consume oxygen at nearly twice the rate of adults (6 versus 3 mL/kg/min). Because the efflux of oxygen from the alveolus is increased, any process that decreases ventilation and the influx of oxygen will lead to a rapid decrease in the PAO2 and, as a result, markedly increase the risk of hypoxemia.

On physical exam, his vital signs include a RR of 20 breaths/min, HR of 100 beats/min, BP 130/82 mm Hg and a hemoglobin-oxygen saturation of 86%. There are no breath sounds at the base of his left lung. 1. Consider the gentleman\\'s lungs as having two compartments. If the blood flow to each compartment is equal, what are the relative VA/Q ratios between the left compartment and the right compartment (which is receiving no ventilation)? Note: In the answers that follow, left and right refer to the figure above. The situation depicted in the figure above is very different than with the boy who aspirated the toy soldier in Case 2. In this man\\'s case, the lung unit on the right side in the figure above is filled with pus due to pneumonia. There is no ventilation getting down to that unit. A unit that receives no ventilation but continues to receive perfusion has a VA/Q ratio of zero. This ratio represents a situation referred to as shunt. Blood transits from the venous side of the circulation to the left atrium without participating in gas exchange at an alveolar-capillary interface. 2. What will happen to the PAO2 and PACO2 in the two compartments? The PAO2 and PACO2 will be unchanged on the left side. On the right side, major changes occur in both values compared to where they were before his illness. The PAO2 essentially falls to that of the mixed venous O2 as there is no new oxygen delivered to the alveolus due to the lack of ventilation. As a result, the alveolus equilibrates with the surrounding blood from the venous circulation. The PACO2 rises to the mixed venous value of around 46 mm Hg since no carbon dioxide is taken away from that alveolar unit. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers 9 \\nCase 3 (continued) 3. Compare the partial pressure of oxygen (PcO2) and oxygen content (CcO2) at points A and B.How will this affect the PaO2 and CaO2 when blood from the two compartments combine in the left atrium? What will happen to the (A-a)ΔO2? The PcO2 and CcO2 on the left side are unchanged compared to prior to his illness. On the right side, because the alveolus is filled with pus, there is no gas exchange. As a result, the capillary blood leaving that unit at point B has the same PO2 and oxygen content as the blood that entered the unit, i.e., mixed venous blood. When the blood from the left and right sides mixes in the left atrium, the significantly lower PO2 and oxygen content from the right side pull down the overall PO2 and oxygen content of the arterial blood such that PaO2 and CaO2 are both lower than the values at point A and before his illness. The (A-a)ΔO2 is increased compared to prior to his illness. 4. The respiratory therapist gives the patient supplemental oxygen so that the FIO2 increases to 0.4 but the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation improves by only a few percentage points to 88-89%. Why didn\\'t the patient experience a bigger improvement? If we give this person supplemental oxygen the PAO2 increases in the lung unit on the left side. The capillary PO2 increases due to the rise in PAO2. Capillary oxygen content does not increase a lot, however, because at these high PO2 values, you are on the very flat portion of the Hb-O2 dissociation curve where all of the hemoglobin binding sites are occupied by oxygen. The alveolus on the right is still filled with pus, however, so none of this extra oxygen gets down to that area. The capillary blood continues to have the mixed venous PO2 and oxygen content. The blood from this side mixes with the blood from the left side and, as a result, you end up with a PO2 and oxygen content that are far lower than those values seen on the left side. Arterial PO2 and oxygen content have increased a little compared to prior to supplemental oxygen administration but not nearly as much as they would if the lung unit on the right side was not filled with pus. The (A-a)ΔO2 remains very high. 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 3 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) The lack of significant response to supplemental oxygen administration is one of the things that distinguishes shunt physiology from low VA/Q physiology. Unlike shunt, low VA/Q responds quite well to supplemental oxygen administration. In fact, if you were to put a patient who only had low VA/Q as the cause of his hypoxemia on supplemental oxygen, the PaO2 would rise significantly. As you will see later in the course, this is what we see clinically in patients with COPD exacerbations. They often come in very hypoxemic but because they primarily have low VA/Q as the cause of their hypoxemia, rather than shunt, oxygenation improves markedly with administration of only modest amounts of supplemental oxygen. Patients with pneumonia, on the other hand, have a lot of shunt physiology and, as a result, are often refractory to supplemental oxygen administration. PaO2 increases a little in that case but not by much and well less than what you would see with low VA/Q.It must be noted that it is incorrect to say that the \"PaO2 does not improve at all when supplemental oxygen is administered in the setting of shunt.\" The PaO2 and arterial oxygen content do improve but only by a modest amount and less than would occur if the patient primarily had low VA/Q as the cause of their hypoxemia. 5. When the patient ambulates, his hemoglobin-oxygen saturation falls significantly to 77%. Why does this happen? When the patient ambulates, oxygen consumption (VO2) in the tissues increases. The tissues extract more oxygen from the blood and, as a result, the mixed venous PO2 and oxygen content decrease relative to the resting state. The decrease in these values contributes to worsening gas exchange in the lungs. To see why this happens consider our simple model in the figure accompanying this case. When the mixed venous blood returns to the left side, full equilibration occurs and the capillary PO2 and oxygen content rise appropriately on that side such that the capillary PO2 and the alveolar PO2 are the same as the blood exits that unit. When the mixed venous blood returns to the right side, however, no gas exchange occurs and the capillary blood leaves the unit with the same PO2 and oxygen content as the mixed venous blood. The blood from the left and right sides still mix in the left atrium but now the blood provided by the right side has an even lower PO2 and oxygen content than prior to ambulation and, as a result, the mixing process yields a lower PaO2 and arterial oxygen content than when he was at rest.

Upon evaluation by the medics, his vital signs are: BP 100/56 mm Hg, HR 78 bpm, RR 6 breaths/min and SpO2 of 80% while breathing air. On exam, his pupils are pinpoint and he has clear breath sounds. An arterial blood gas drawn in the Emergency Department while breathing air reveals a PaO2 of 50 mm Hg and a PaCO2 of 56. mm Hg What is(are) the cause(s) of his hypoxemia? The patient is not at high altitude. Low PIO2 is therefore not contributing to hypoxemia. The patient has a PaCO2 of 56, mm Hg which is elevated. He is, by definition, hypoventilating and this is contributing to his hypoxemia. The key question is whether hypoventilation alone explains all of his hypoxemia or whether something else is playing a role. We rarely attribute hypoxemia at rest to diffusion limitation but he could have either shunt and/or low VA/Q.To figure this out, we need to use the alveolar gas equation and calculate his alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [(A-a)ΔO2]. If he has hypoventilation alone, the (A-a)ΔO2 is normal, whereas if he has shunt or low VA/Q, the (A-a)ΔO2 is increased. We start by figuring out the alveolar PO2. PAO2 = (PB - 47) FIO2 - PaCO2/R where R is assumed to be 0.8 PAO2 = (760-47) 0.21 - 56/0.8 PAO2 = 80 mm Hg With this information, we can calculate the (A-a)ΔO2: (A-a)ΔO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 (A-a)ΔO2 = 80 - 50 = 30 mm Hg An (A-a)ΔO2 of 30 mm Hg is higher than normal (~ 10 mm Hg) for a 21 year-old individual. This tells us that he has something else, either shunt or low VA/Q, that is contributing along with the hypoventilation to his hypoxemia. To determine which of these two additional factors is at work in this patient, we would need to assess the response to supplemental oxygen administration (this information was not provided in the case).

Her vital signs are: BP 145/86 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, RR 22 breaths/min and SpO2 of 92% while breathing air. Wheezing is heard on auscultation of her chest. An arterial blood gas while breathing air reveals a PaO2 of 70 mm Hg and a PaCO2 of 36 mm Hg. When given an FIO2 of 0.3, her SpO2 of 92% increases to 98%. What is(are) the cause(s) of her hypoxemia? There is no information given about the altitude at which the patient is being evaluated. We can assume that low PIO2 is not contributing to her hypoxemia. As evidenced by the fact that she has a PaCO2 of 36 mm Hg, we can say that she is not hypoventilating and that hypoventilation is not contributing to her hypoxemia. She, therefore, likely has either shunt or low VA/Q as the cause of her hypoxemia. We rarely attribute resting hypoxemia to diffusion limitation. We know this because her (A-a)ΔO2 is increased as you can see from the calculations below: PAO2 = (PB - 47) FIO2 - PaCO2/R PAO2 = (760-47) 0.21 - 36/0.8 PAO2 = 105 mm Hg (A-a)ΔO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 (A-a)ΔO2 = 105 - 70 = 35 mm Hg The SaO2 increased from 92 to 98% with supplemental oxygen. This is a good response and suggests low VA/Q is primarily responsible for her hypoxemia rather than shunt, as oxygenation does not usually improve much in shunt when supplemental oxygen is administered. The case description - in particular, the fact that she is wheezing - suggests that the patient may have asthma as the cause of her dyspnea. As you will learn later in the course, asthma, like COPD, leads to a lot of low VA/Q regions in the lung due to the effects of asthma on the airways including mucosal edema and inflammation, increased mucus production, airway smooth muscle contraction. As in COPD, hypoxemia in this situation tends to respond readily to supplemental oxygen administration.

INTRODUCTION This syllabus chapter covers the embryology of the heart and great vessels and related adult anatomy. The detailed adult anatomy of the heart, pericardium, and great vessels is covered in subsequent syllabus chapters and the gross anatomy labs. Note that at the end of this syllabus are links to a few very helpful videos that are worth watching and will save you time searching for ones on your own. In order to better understand the different developmental stages that the heart and great vessels undergo in the embryo, it\\'s important to have knowledge of blood flow through the adult heart. The heart can be conceptualized as two pumps working side by side. Each of these pumps has a receiving chamber and a pumping chamber-the atria and ventricles, respectively-making four chambers in total (Figure 1). Deoxygenated blood is drained from the systemic circulation into the right atrium via the SVC, IVC, and coronary sinus. From there, blood enters the right ventricle to be pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries. After oxygenation in the lungs, Figure 1. Blood circulation in the adult CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 1 \\nblood returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. From there, blood enters the left ventricle to be pumped into the aorta and through the entire systemic circulation. In comparison to the adult heart, the late fetal heart is adapted for life in utero. In the hours and days after birth, changes take place in response to the lungs and pulmonary circulation becoming functional. To understand this important transition, let\\'s first take a look at the late fetal circulation, and the changes that take place in the newborn. FETAL CIRCULATION & FETAL HEART JUST PRIOR TO BIRTH Nutrient rich, oxygenated blood from the placenta reaches the fetus via one umbilical vein contained within the umbilical cord. Note that the term vein is defined as a vessel carrying blood to the heart even though the blood is oxygenated (this is why it\\'s red in Figure 2). Because the blood from the placenta is theoretically \"clean\" and the liver is still developing, this blood can mostly bypass the liver through the ductus venosus, a temporary vessel that shunts the blood from the umbilical vein directly to the inferior vena cava (IVC). At this point, blood from the IVC enters the right atrium where the majority of it is shunted into the left atrium through an opening in the interatrial septum called the foramen ovale. This flow of blood from the right atrium directly to the left atrium, allows the oxygenated blood to flow into the left ventricle and then aorta, bypassing the developing lungs which are filled amnionic fluid and are essentially collapsed until first breath at birth. The small amount of blood that does enter the right ventricle and subsequently the pulmonary trunk is largely diverted to the arch of the aorta via a shunt vessel called the ductus arteriosus. Figure 2. Blood circulation in the fetus Thus, there are two features of the fetal heart that shunt oxygenated blood into the systemic circulation, bypassing the lungs: the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus. Both of these structures remain as visible remnants in the adult heart that you will see in the anatomy lab. In the final step of its journey back to the placenta, blood moves through the two umbilical arteries that carry the 2 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\ndeoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. Note the term artery is defined as a vessel carrying blood away from the heart even though in this case, it is deoxygenated (the purple color of these vessels in Figure 2 indicates that this blood is a mix of oxygenated and deoxygenated). CHANGES IN THE NEWBORN HEART & CIRCULATION After birth, when the baby takes its first few breaths of air and expels the amniotic fluid from its lungs, there is increased blood flow through the lungs and subsequently into the left atrium via the pulmonary circulation. The increased pressure in the left atrium holds the valve of the foramen ovale against the interatrial septum, which functionally closes the foramen ovale. The valve eventually fuses against the septum, but in about 25% of people there is a \"probe patent\" foramen ovale (a hole so small that one can pass only a probe through it), in which the valve is closed but not completely fused. The location of the \"closed\" foramen ovale in the fetal heart becomes a depression in the right atrium of the adult heart called the fossa ovalis (Figure 3). The ductus arteriosus also closes a few days after birth, leaving a fibrous cord called the ligamentum arteriosum. This remnant is located exactly where it was in the fetus, between the pulmonary trunk and the arch of the aorta (Figure 3). The umbilical arteries, umbilical vein, and ductus venosus, all obliterate after birth and leave behind remnants that you can see in the adult. The umbilical vein forms the round ligament of the liver, located between the umbilicus and the inferior surface of the liver. The ductus venosus becomes the ligamentum venosum located on the posterior surface of the liver near the IVC.The umbilical arteries become the medial umbilical ligaments which you saw on the posterior surface of the anterior abdominal wall during your MCBD block (see table at the end of this chapter). Figure 3. Blood circulation in the newborn CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 3 \\nClinical correlation: A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occurs when the ductus arteriosus does not close after birth. PDA\\'s allow blood from the high pressure arch of the aorta to flow into the lower pressure pulmonary circulation via the pulmonary trunk. A characteristic continuous, machine-like murmur is heard throughout the cardiac cycle. PDA\\'s can have very serious consequences. For example, the lungs can be irreversibly damaged (Eisenmenger syndrome), or the left atrium and left ventricle can become enlarged. HEART TUBE DEVELOPMENT We will now return to the early embryo that we discussed in MCBD, to trace the development of the heart from a single tube to the definitive four chambered heart located in the thorax. FORMATION OF THE HEART TUBE & HEART LOOPING After the formation of the trilaminar embryo at the end of week 3, complex vascular networks and plexuses are organizing in the newly formed mesoderm. Clusters of mesenchymal cells called angioblasts form in a horseshoe-shaped cardiogenic area of the embryonic disc (Figure 4 - far left). Two endocardial tubes form and, as a consequence of the head fold, these two tubes are relocated to the developing thorax where they fuse and create a single primitive heart tube (Fig. 4 - top row). This primitive heart tube begins beating and pumping blood by about day 22. Figure 4. Formation of the single primitive heart tube from two endocardial tubes. 4 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nThe heart tube is composed of an inner layer of endothelial cells, which are continuous with the lining of blood vessels, surrounded by a thick layer of cardiogenic mesoderm. The endothelial lining of the heart tube gives rise to the definitive endocardium. The cardiogenic mesoderm differentiates into two layers - the myocardium (heart muscle) and the cardiac jelly, an acellular mass located between the myocardium and the endothelium. At the atrioventricular junction of the heart tube, the important endocardial cushions will give rise to primordial mitral and tricuspid valves (atrioventricular valves) (Figure 7). The outermost mesodermal layer of the heart tube forms a serous membrane that becomes the epicardium, also known as the visceral layer of the serous pericardium. At this point, swellings form in the heart tube that create the primitive chambers. From caudal to cranial, these chambers are the sinus venosus, primitive atrium, primitive ventricle, bulbus cordis, and truncus arteriosus (Figures 4 & 5). Blood enters the beating heart tube at the sinus venosus (venous end; inflow tract), and then flows through the primitive atrium, primitive ventricle, bulbus cordis, and leaves via the truncus arteriosus (arterial end; outflow tract). The pacemaker region of the primitive heart is located in the sinus venosus. The sinoatrial (SA) node of the adult heart is derived from this embryonic pacemaker tissue. The primordial heart is located within the developing pericardial sac, which restricts the growth of the heart tube causing it to fold and rotate to the right (Figures 4-6). There are several important consequences of this folding and looping that play a major role in the development of the external form of the adult heart. The folding and looping places the venous and arterial ends next to each other cranially and moves the venous end with the primitive atrium posterior and superior to the ventricles. In addition, the bulbus cordis moves to the right and the primitive ventricle to the left. These movements explain why the ventricles are ventral and inferior, the outflow vessels are ventral and superior, and the apex of the heart points to the left (Figures 5 & 6). Figure 5. Heart looping brings the definitive atria into a posterosuperior location. Clinical correlate: If the rotation of the heart takes place to the left instead of to the right, this is known as dextrocardia, the most frequent positional abnormality of the heart. Dextrocardia can occur as an isolated defect or with situs inversus. CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 5 \\nThe repositioning of the outflow and inflow tracts so that they are next to each other creates two modifications of the pericardial cavity that persist in the adult: the transverse and the oblique pericardial sinuses (Figure 6). The transverse pericardial sinus is what remains of the space between the inflow and outflow sides of the primitive heart. It lies between the superior vena cava (inflow) and the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk (outflow). The oblique pericardial sinus is a cul-de-sac behind the base of the heart and is limited by the four pulmonary veins and the inferior vena cava (inflow). Figure 6. \"Hot dog in a bun\" view of the development of the pericardial spaces. PARTITIONING OF THE HEART Remember that the final adult heart is divided into left and right sides with each chamber having an inflow and outflow of its own (review Figure 1). The next step in heart development is called septation or partitioning and it divides the single primitive heart tube into left and right sides. It involves dividing the primitive atrium, primitive ventricle, bulbus cordis, and truncus arteriosus, and shifting the sinus venosus to the right side of the heart. Septation must proceed so that the resulting divisions have the proper proportions and alignment. It is easy to appreciate that errors in septation can lead to major congenital heart defects. We will separately describe the partitioning of different parts of the heart in steps (e.g., by formation of interatrial and interventricular septa), but it is important to realize these events are actually taking place at the same time. FORMATION OF THE ENDOCARDIAL CUSHIONS The first step in the septation process that is critical for the steps that follow is the formation of the endocardial cushions. The layout of the primitive heart tube in a sagittal cut is shown in Figure 7A, with the direction of blood flow from sinus venosus to truncus arteriosus indicated by arrows. At this point, there is a single channel between the atrium and ventricle called the atrioventricular (AV) canal through which blood flows. The soon-to-be divided left and right sides of the heart will each need their own AV canals and this process begins with the growth of the endocardial cushions. 6 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nFigure 7. Growth of endocardial cushions to make two atrioventricular canals. Endocardial cushion tissue grows down the middle of the single AV canal from both the dorsal and ventral sides (Figure 7B). These dorsal and ventral endocardial cushions do NOT block the flow of blood from the atrium to the ventricle - as you might think from Figure 7C - but rather they meet each other only in the middle and leave a left and a right AV canal on either side which you can see in the frontal view shown in Figure 7D.This fused endocardial cushion tissue is absolutely crucial to the formation of the normal heart, as you can imagine from its location. It is an anchor point for completion of both the interatrial and interventricular septa, and it is intimately involved with forming the tricuspid and mitral (AV) valves. The constellation of defects that can occur from failure of the endocardial cushions to develop properly will be taken up in detail later in the CPR block. FORMATION OF THE INTERATRIAL SEPTUM The second step in the septation process is the formation of the interatrial septum, which presents a special sort of problem because we need this septum to function differently in fetal vspostnatal life. Recall that during fetal life, we need the interatrial septum to be a one-way flap valve that directs blood flowing from the IVC to the right atrium into the left atrium, bypassing the lungs. But in postnatal life, when the lungs are functioning, we need the interatrial septum to be closed. CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 7 \\nTo build a temporary, one-way flap valve, two side-by-side septa are dropped from the cranial margin of what will become the interatrial septum (Figure 8A & B). The first is called the septum primum (first septum) and it grows from cranial to caudal toward the fused endocardial cushions (Figure 8A, light blue). The gap between the bottom of septum primum and the endocardial cushions is called the foramen (or ostium) primum. Foramen primum will close shortly, but we need the septum primum to not block blood flow from right to left. Therefore, as it grows, the upper part of septum primum becomes perforated by a lot of little holes which fuse to form a single hole, the foramen (ostium) secundum (Figure 8B). Both foramen primum and secundum are formed within the septum primum. After formation of foramen secundum, foramen primum closes as septum primum fuses with the endocardial cushions - it\\'s a carefully choreographed dance. The second septum, septum secundum, also grows from cranial to caudal, in a location to the right of septum primum (Figure 8B, green). Septum secundum eventually covers foramen secundum. The caudal edge of septum secundum does not entirely reach the fused endocardial cushions but rather leaves a gap below its curved inferior free margin. This opening is called the foramen ovale (Figure 8C). Foramen ovale and foramen secundum are staggered (offset from each other), producing an oblique channel from lower right (foramen ovale) to upper left (foramen secundum). When blood passes from the right atrium to the left atrium, it passes first through foramen ovale, A B C Figure 8. (A) Diagram of the growth of septum primum (blue) and ostium primum. (B) Formation of ostium secundum within septum primum as the ostium primum closes. Septum secundum (green) grows to the right of septum primum. (C) Finished product with blood flow (pink arrow) from right to left atrium through foramen ovale and ostium secundum. 8 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nthen through foramen secundum. In the fetus, the valve of the foramen ovale is open when the atria are filling (the part of the cardiac cycle called diastole). The valve closes when the pressure in the left atrium increases (end of diastole), and then it reopens when the blood is rushing into the right atrium and across the shunt into the left atrium. So, the cycle of opening and closing the valve is in sync with the cardiac cycle (watch the video). In summary, an interatrial septum is created with a flap valve in it to meet the needs of the fetal circulation and at birth, when the pulmonary circulation is functional and the pressure in the left atrium increases, the valve is held closed. Clinical correlate: A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a hole in the atrial septum due to the incomplete fusion of the flap of the valve of foramen ovale and septum secundum after birth. PFO\\'s can be small (probe PFO, 25% of the population, left diagram) and often go unnoticed although they can increase the risk of a stroke. Larger PFO\\'s (middle diagram) can significantly alter the flow of blood between the right and left atrium and cause noticeable symptoms such as fatigue and shortness of breath. Atrial septal defects (ASD) (right diagram) are larger holds in the atrial septum and most commonly due to foramen secundum defects. Defects in foramen primum, sinus venosus, or coronary sinus formation are less common types of ASD\\'s. FORMATION OF THE INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM The third step in partitioning of the heart tube is the septation of the primitive ventricles. This step is complicated by the fact that the ventricles are derived from both the primitive ventricle and the bulbus cordis, which are connected from caudal to cranial (see Figure 7A), and we need the right and left ventricles to be in parallel. Just prior to septation, the two chambers are remodeled and the two AV canals become realigned (Figure 9). We can \"fast-forward\" past the details, and note where the adult structures come from in the following table: Adult structure Right ventricle Inflow portion Outflow portion Left ventricle Inflow portion Outflow portion Table 1. Summary of ventricular development Embryological origin Proximal bulbis cordis Distal bulbus cordis Primitive ventricle Distal bulbus cordis CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 9 \\nAt this point, blood is flowing into the right and left ventricles which are still communicating with one another through the interventricular foramen, and then the blood from both chambers is flowing into the bulbus cordis (review Figure 7A). The next step in septation is to separate the outflow of the right and left ventricles and complete the interventricular septum. As the ventricles expand and are hollowed out to become open chambers, the myocardium between the two ventricles remains as the muscular part of the interventricular septum (Figs 7D & 9). The space between the cranial free edge of the growing septum and the fused endocardial cushions is the interventricular foramen. (All hearts start out with a hole in them!) Figure 9. Formation of the interventricular septum After the growth of the muscular ventricular septum, the completion of the interventricular septum is accomplished by the closure of the interventricular foramen, which involves fusion of the cranial end of the muscular septum with the endocardial cushions and the forming trunco-conal septum (Figure 10, green & yellow structures). So, we will need to discuss the formation of the trunco-conal septum before we complete the IV septum. These are complex and highly important processes so it is not surprising that many heart defects occur in this region. The closure of the interventricular foramen takes place at the same time as the division of the truncus arteriosus into the ascending aorta and pulmonary trunk. Remember that these are the outflow parts of the left and right ventricles, respectively. Partitioning of the truncus arteriosus and distal bulbus cordis begins with the growth of two ridges in their walls (yellow & green structures in Figs 10 & 11). These ridges grow toward each other and the endocardial cushions. Together they form the trunco-conal septum that divides the truncus arteriosus into aortic and pulmonary channels (Figures 10-12). This septum twists in a spiral and is, therefore, also referred to as the spiral septum. Figure 10. Trunco-conal septum growth Similarly, the spiral septum divides the distal bulbus cordis into the outflow tracts of the ventricles: Right ventricle = infundibulum, connected to the pulmonary channel Left ventricle = aortic vestibule, connected to the aortic channel 10 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nFinally, let\\'s complete the interventricular septum. The trunco- conal septum grows toward the fused endocardial cushions. Completion of the interventricular (IV) septum is accomplished by fusion of the spiral septum, the endocardial cushions, and the muscular ventricular septum (Figure 11). This closes off the interventricular foramen, and forms the smaller, upper portion of the IV septum, the membranous part of the interventricular septum. The membranous part of the interventricular septum contains little myocardial tissue and merges with the larger muscular part of the interventricular septum. The membranous IV septum separates the outflow portions of the two ventricles. However, the aortic vestibule is twisted posteriorly so that it lies ever so slightly above the right AV orifice, adjacent to the interatrial septum (Figure 12). Thus, a small part of the interventricular septum is actually the atrioventricular portion of the IV septum, because it separates the right atrium from the outflow part of the left ventricle. Figure 11. Formation of the interventricular septum from the truncal-conal septum, endocardial cushions and muscular septum. Modern terminology divides the membranous part of the IV septum into two portions: 1. interventricular portion 2. atrioventricular portion Figure 12. Trunco-conal (aorticopulmonary) septum results in aorta and pulmonary trunk spiraling around each other. CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 11 \\n Important parts of the trunco-conal septum are derived from neural crest cells that migrate into the developing heart. These cardiac neural crest cells form connective tissue and muscular elements of the trunco-conal septum and form the parasympathetic postganglionic neurons that innervate the heart. Furthermore, neural crest cells assist in the development of the aortic and pulmonary semilunar valves. Failure of these cells to migrate or differentiate has been linked to congenital abnormalities of the heart, especially those involving division of the truncus arteriosus. Examples of septation errors, to be discussed later in this block, include transposition (actual switching) of the great arteries and persistent truncus arteriosus (one artery coming from both ventricles). At this point, the heart tube has been divided into a four- chambered heart with each side having an inflow and outflow. Now let\\'s turn our attention to the venous (inflow) and arterial (outflow). Clinical correlate: Tetralogy of Fallot is a rare condition where the infant heart has four classic malformations: (1) pulmonary stenosis (obstructed right ventricular outflow into the pulmonary trunk), (2) ventricular septal defect (VSD), (3) dextroposition of the aorta (aortic orifice overriding both ventricular outflows), and (4) resultant right ventricular hypertrophy. There is also often a patent ductus arteriosus. 12 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nDEVELOPMENT OF ATRIAL WALLS & THE VEINS Much of the smooth, posterior wall of the right atrium derives from incorporation of part of the sinus venosus. This part of the adult atrium is termed the sinus venarum and is located between the superior and inferior vena cavae. In the adult heart, the smooth walled part of the right atrium is separated from the muscular part by a ridge called the crista terminalis. The pacemaker tissue of the sinus venosus becomes located in the wall of the right atrium, at the junction of the superior vena cava and the crista terminalis. The sinus venosus also contributes to the posterior part of the interatrial septum, and failure of proper development of the sinus venosus can lead to one type of atrial septal defect (ASD). Remodeling of the left atrium takes place by incorporating the four pulmonary veins into the posterior atrial wall. The part of the left atrium with pectinate muscle is a small remnant of the primitive atrium known as the left auricle (left auricular appendage). Figure 13. Blood flow in the embryo Initially, the inflow end of the heart, or sinus venosus, receives blood from three pair of vessels (Figures 13 & 14A): Left and right common cardinal veins - these drain blood from the tissues of the embryo itself. The common cardinal veins are short trunks formed by the union of the anterior (from the head, sometimes called precardinal) and posterior (from the trunk, sometimes called postcardinal) cardinal veins. Left and right vitelline veins - receive blood from the yolk sac (which will soon degenerate). Left and right umbilical veins - bringing oxygenated blood from the placenta to the embryo.   The first step in remodeling the venous end of the heart is the formation of two left-to-right shunts with the result being that all venous blood entering the heart from the embryo and placenta is shifted to the right atrium via two newly formed vessels - the superior and inferior venae cavae. The superior and inferior venae cavae in addition to the coronary sinus, form the inflow into the right atrium in the adult heart. CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 13 \\nVENOUS REMODELING AT THE CAUDAL END The first shunt is called the ductus venosus, a caudal venous shunt that bypasses the parenchyma of the liver, allowing oxygenated blood from the left umbilical vein to flow directly into the IVC (blue arrow in Figure 14B). The ductus venosus reduces blood flow to the left posterior cardinal and vitelline veins. As a result, their proximal parts disappear. Note that the formation and degeneration of arteries and veins is a common theme in development. As a result of this remodeling, the proximal right vitelline vein enlarges to become the terminal portion of the inferior vena cava. The right umbilical vein degenerates leaving only one umbilical vein entering the ductus venosus on the left. After birth, the ductus venosus closes and degenerates, becoming the vestigial ligamentum venosum (review Figure 3). The umbilical vein obliterates as well, becoming the round ligament of the liver. So what vessels are left entering the adult heart after all this caudal remodeling? Basically - the terminal part of the IVC as it enters the right atrium (Figure 14C). Figure 14. Venous remodeling 14 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nVENOUS REMODELING AT THE CRANIAL END The second shunt that forms in the venous system is at the cranial end of the embryo. The proximal portion of the right anterior cardinal vein and the right common cardinal vein become the superior vena cava. Venous blood is shunted from the left to the right anterior cardinal vein through an anterior cardinal anastomosis (red arrow in Figure 14B). The anterior cardinal anastomosis becomes the left brachiocephalic vein which is thus much longer than the right. The left common cardinal vein shrinks and in the adult it becomes the small oblique cardiac vein of the left atrium. The left sinus horn of the sinus venosus shrinks to become the coronary sinus (Figure 14C). In summary, cranial remodeling forms these channels directed toward the right atrium: the SVC, the brachiocephalic veins, and the coronary sinus. AORTIC ARCH DEVELOPMENT & THE RECURRENT LARYNGEAL NERVE At the outflow or arterial end of the heart tube, blood is flowing from the truncus arteriosus into the aortic sac. Cranial to the truncus arteriosus are five pairs of transient aortic arches (1, 2, 3, 4, & 6) that connect to the arterial end of the heart to the original left and right dorsal aortae (Figure 15). The aortic arches pass through the pharyngeal arches in the neck region of the embryo (more on the pharyngeal arches in the Energetics & Homeostasis block). The only aortic arches that are retained are the 3rd, 4th, and the left 6th. Figure 15 shows the three major steps in this remodeling process but don\\'t get lost in the detail of this figure, rather understand the resultant anatomy. The 3rd arch gives rise to the right and left common carotid arteries from which the external and internal carotid arteries branch. On the right side, the common carotid and subclavian arteries are branches of the brachiocephalic artery. On the left side, the common carotid and subclavian arteries are direct branches off the arch of the aorta. Figure 15. Development of arterial structures CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart 15 \\nThe 4th arch gives rise to the subclavian artery (on the right) and part of the arch of the aorta (on the left). The left 6th arch produces the ductus arteriosus (see Table 2 for a summary of adult derivatives). This difference on the right and left in development of arches 4 and 6 sets up not only arterial differences in the adult, but also where a few important nerves are located in relationship to these arteries (Figure 16). On the right, the vagus nerve is located posterior to the aortic arch. On the left, it is located anterior. You will see this in the anatomy lab. The recurrent laryngeal nerves, branches of the vagus, originally looped under the 6th aortic arches to supply the larynx. The developing larynx forms in the neck during head folding, and as the embryo grows, these nerves lengthen. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve is caught under the developing left 6th aortic arch and remains looped around the arch of the aorta in the adult posterior to the ligamentum arteriosum (Figure 16C). The right 6th aortic arch disappears, and since the 5th aortic arch artery degenerates, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve loops under the next highest arch that is retained, which is the 4th arch. Therefore, in the adult, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve hooks around the right subclavian artery (Figure 16C). Figure 16. Association of recurrent laryngeal nerves with aortic arch arteries. With so many complicated processes happening at the arterial end of the embryo, slight variations in aortic arch development are normal and often do not result in major blood flow problems. However, a few defects can be more problematic, like the double aortic arch shown in the clinical correlate. Clinical correlate: Double arch of the aorta due to abnormal development of the aortic arch arteries. The vascular ring that is formed around the trachea and esophagus can cause compression of these structures, especially the esophagus. 16 CPR-HFF Syllabus-Anatomy and Embryology of the Heart \\nSUMMARY OF PRIMITIVE STRUCTURES AND ADULT DERIVATIVES Embryonic Structure Heart chambers Adult Derivative Notes Sinus venosus Primitive atrium Smooth wall of right atrium = sinus venarum Location of SA node Coronary sinus Rough parts (auricles) of left and right atria Ventricle and bulbus cordis, together Left and right ventricles With pectinate muscle (musculi pectini) Primitive ventricle + proximal bulbus cordis give rise to the left and right inflow tracts, resp.

She and multiple team members will serve as subjects for studies performed at sea level and again following arrival at Cerro de Pasco, Peru (elevation: 4,300 m). While they are there, they will also conduct experiments on lifelong residents of the city, including a cohort of subjects with Chronic Mountain Sickness, a form of altitude illness seen in long-term high altitude residents (> 2500 m) marked by the presence of increased hemoglobin concentration (referred to as excessive erythrocytosis or polycythemia), severe hypoxemia and, in some cases pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure (cor pulmonale). 1. If you were to compare her minute ventilation at rest following arrival at Cerro de Pasco with that measured at sea level at the start of the project, what would you expect to find? What is the mechanism for the observed change? With ascent to high altitude, barometric pressure falls, leading to a decrease in the inspired, alveolar and arterial PO2. The decrease in PaO2 leads to an increase in minute ventilation. This response, referred to as the hypoxic ventilatory response, varies in magnitude between individuals and is mediated by the peripheral chemoreceptors located in the carotid bodies. The central chemoreceptors do not respond to changes in PaO2. Importantly, the peripheral chemoreceptors respond to changes in PaO2 rather than oxygen content (CaO2). If you were to decrease oxygen content by decreasing hemoglobin concentration, but kept PaO2 constant, minute ventilation would not change. 2. How will her PaCO2 change following arrival at high altitude? What effect would you expect this to have on the change in ventilation described in the first question? The PaCO2 is determined by the balance between how much CO2 is produced in the tissues and how much is eliminated by the lungs through alveolar ventilation. If she remains at rest following ascent, we can assume her CO2 production is constant. Because her dead space ventilation likely does not change on ascent, the increase in minute ventilation increases alveolar ventilation. In the setting of constant CO2 production, an increase in alveolar ventilation will cause her PaCO2 to decrease. In other words, she now has hyperventilation. As you will learn later in the renal component of this course, hyperventilation leads to what is referred to as a respiratory alkalosis on her arterial blood gas. A decrease in PaCO2 will actually blunt the increase in ventilation that developed in response to the hypoxemia. You will recall that the central chemoreceptors (as well as the peripheral chemoreceptors to a more limited extent) respond to changes in PaCO2. Increases in PaCO2 raises central chemoreceptor output while decreases in PaCO2 decrease central chemoreceptor output. As a result, when PaCO2 falls following ascent due to the hypoxic ventilatory response, central chemoreceptor output declines and minute ventilation decreases below what would be seen if you were able to hold her PaCO2 constant during this experiment. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 1 \\n Case 1 (continued) Due to compensatory responses that occur in CSF and brain interstitial fluid composition over a period of several days, the braking effect of the decreased PaCO2 goes away and ventilation rises to higher and higher levels as she spends more time at high altitude. 3. Her minute ventilation was measured at sea level while she inhaled varying concentrations of carbon dioxide. In the blank graph below, draw a graph representing the expected changes in ventilation as function of PaCO2? Focus on the general trends rather than specific values. How would you expect this relationship to change when the same experiment is repeated following ascent to Cerro de Pasco? At sea level you would expect to see a linear relationship between minute ventilation and PaCO2 such that as PaCO2 increases, minute ventilation increases due to an increase in central (and to a lesser extent peripheral) chemoreceptor output. The sensitivity of this hypercapnic ventilatory response is increased in the setting of hypoxemia. As PO2 decreases the level of minute ventilation at any PaCO2 is higher. As a result, we would expect the relationship to shift up and to the left as shown in the figure below. Recognize that the magnitude of these responses varies between individuals. Therefore, rather than focusing on specific values, you should only pay attention to the general trends. 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\n Case 1 (continued) On the third day of the study, the team took a break and went for a hike in the hills around town. She noted more difficulty breathing than on a hike the previous day and had trouble keeping up with her hiking partners. That evening, she started to feel out of breath with minor exertion such as walking to the bathroom or changing her clothing. She tried to go to bed, but had difficulty breathing in the supine position. Worried about the situation, she awoke her roommate and went to the project leader. Using equipment available for the research study, they performed a chest radiograph, which is shown below. 4. If you were to compare her minute ventilation and PaCO2 at this time to the previous day, what would you expect to find? The patient has developed increasing dyspnea such that she is now dyspneic with very simple activities. The chest radiograph shown above shows bilateral alveolar opacities, predominantly in the lung bases. You will recall from the session on chest radiology that this suggests she has an alveolar-filling process. You would expect based on these findings of the chest radiograph that she will have increased hypoxemia beyond that due to the altitude alone. Alveolar-filling processes cause shunt physiology (Chapter 6 and the conference on Why Is My Patient Hypoxemic), which, in turn, leads to hypoxemia. As the PaO2 falls, there is increased stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors and a further rise in her minute ventilation. Assuming there is no change in her metabolic activity or dead space, the increase in minute and, therefore, alveolar ventilation will cause a further decrease in the PaCO2. This can be appreciated from Figure 8-2 in the course syllabus, which shows that there is a dose response to the hypoxic ventilatory response, whereby increased hypoxemia leads to further increases in minute ventilation. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 3 \\n Case 1 (continued) Note that while the figure uses the alveolar PO2 on the x-axis, this phenomenon is seen with changes in the arterial PO2. It should also be noted that as an individual spends more time at a given altitude, minute ventilation rises and PaCO2 decreases further from that seen upon initial arrival because of a process known as ventilatory acclimatization (the details of how this occurs are beyond what you need to know at this time). As a result, even if she were not becoming ill as she is at this time, her minute ventilation and PaCO2 would be different than the previous day. The worsening hypoxemia from her illness augments those changes. Optional Material: You were not asked to determine the etiology of her illness but it is worth considering that. Acute dyspnea (occurring over minutes to 1-2 days) can be caused by a variety of things such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, pneumothorax, myocardial ischemia and other process. The opacities on the chest radiograph make things like pneumothorax and pulmonary embolism less likely while pneumonia and pulmonary edema remain considerations. In this particular case, the development of dyspnea, hypoxemia and bilateral opacities in a person who has come up to high altitude in the past 2-4 days is suggestive of a problem known as high altitude pulmonary edema or HAPE.This is a non- cardiogenic form of edema (i.e., left ventricular function and left atrial pressure are normal) that develops due to excessive hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. You will not be responsible for understanding HAPE or its underlying pathophysiology at this time. The more important principles for you to understand are the relationship between what you see on the chest radiograph and the PaO2 and the subsequent effect the changes in PaO2 will have on minute and alveolar ventilation. For those who are interested, more information on HAPE can be found here: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcp1214870?viewType=Print&viewClass=Pri nt& 4 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 2 An 11 year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician\\'s office by her parents who were concerned about her performance in school.

This patient has a clinical history concerning for sleep-disordered breathing and, in particular, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). When suspicion is raised for this diagnosis, the physical exam should include assessment of factors that could contribute to upper airway obstruction during the night. It is important to examine the mouth and look for features of a narrowed airway including an enlarged uvula, large tonsils, macroglossia and an elevated base of the tongue. Adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy is a particularly common finding in children with OSA.An example of a crowded airway in an adult is shown in the figure below. Note how in the image on the right there is much less space due to the fact that the base of the tongue is very high and nearly touching the uvula. In general, the less you can see of the posterior oropharynx, the greater the likelihood the patient has airway obstruction during sleep. Other craniofacial problems that can cause upper airway narrowing and may be seen on exam include nasal septal deviation, nasal polyps, hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates, retrognathia and prognathia. Finally, both increased BMI and neck circumference should be noted (in adults, neck circumference > 16 inches in females and > 17 inches in males increases the probability of OSA), although it should be recognized that OSA can be seen in thin individuals. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 5 \\nCase 2 (continued) The patient is referred for an overnight polysomnogram. A short epoch from that study that displays the pattern of chest wall and abdominal movement and nasal airflow during sleep is provided below (time is on the x-axis): 2. What are the primary findings on this epoch from her sleep study? How do you assess the severity of the problem? The first noteworthy finding in the epoch from her sleep study is the periods where airflow decreases significantly. Decreased airflow is referred to as \"hypopnea\" while complete cessation of airflow is referred to as \"apnea.\" At the same time that airflow decreases, she continues to have chest wall and abdominal movements, indicating that she is continuing to make efforts to breathe. This pattern of ongoing efforts to breathe with periods of absent airflow indicates that the patient is having intermittent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep, a finding consistent with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. When this pattern is noted, severity is graded by summing the number of apneas and hypopneas and dividing by the total sleep time to determine the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). An AHI > 5 is required for the diagnosis of OSA and the higher the value, the more severe the problem. Patients with severe OSA often have AHI values of 30-60 events/hr (you will not be responsible for knowing the thresholds used to assess severity but should understand the general principle of how the AHI is used). 3. What is (are) the pathophysiologic mechanism(s) that account for the observations in the sleep study? The development of airway obstruction during sleep is a function of changes in transmural pressure across the airway wall. You will recall that transmural pressure (PTM) is determined as follows: PTM = Pin - Pout where Pin and Pout refer to the pressure inside and outside the airway lumen. The higher the transmural pressure, the higher the tendency for a distensible structure to remain open. The lower that pressure, the more it tends to collapse. The soft tissues and bony structures that surround the upper airway push inward on the airway. The greater the volume of these structures, as happens in obesity, the greater the pressure (i.e., the higher Pout). When we inhale, pressure inside the airway lumen (Pin) falls. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 6 \\nCase 2 (continued) As a result, the transmural pressure decreases and the airway becomes narrower. Normally, the genioglossus and palatal muscles, collectively referred to as the pharyngeal dilators, are activated during inspiration. This stiffens the airway wall and counteracts the pressure exerted by the soft tissues and bony structures, thereby maintaining airway patency. During sleep, however, the activity of these muscles is decreased. With less ability to counteract the inward pressure exerted by the soft tissues and bony structures, the airway has a greater tendency to collapse. One response as the airway narrows is to make greater inspiratory effort. This actually worsens the problem as the greater inspiratory effort lowers pressure within the airway even further, thereby decreasing transmural pressure even more. Lung volumes during sleep can affect these airway dynamics. On inflation, the lungs exert caudal traction on the trachea and upper airway, stiffening their walls. This helps counteract the inward pressure. When volumes decrease, this stiffening effect is lost and the tendency to collapse increases. This factor plays a role in individuals with markedly increased BMI who often have low lung volumes during sleep because the abdominal contents exert upward pressure against the diaphragm in the supine position. 4. If you were to draw a plot of her oxygen saturation over time in conjunction with this sleep epoch, what pattern would you expect to see (do not worry about the specific values)? How do you account for this pattern? In many but not all patients with OSA, apneas and hypopneas are followed by periods of hypoxemia. Because the apneas and hypopneas occur in a cyclical manner, the oxygen saturation tends to follow an oscillating pattern with a delay of several seconds between the start of the apnea and the decrease in oxygen saturation. The reason for this pattern can be traced to material covered earlier in this course about the determinants of the alveolar PO2. Recall that the PAO2 is determined by the balance between how much oxygen is brought down to the alveolus through alveolar ventilation and how much is taken away by the cardiac output to support tissue oxygen consumption (i.e., the balance between influx and efflux of oxygen at the alveolus). With each apnea or hypopnea, the influx of oxygen to the alveolar space decreases. If efflux remains constant, PAO2 must fall, leading to a decrease in PaO2 and SaO2. When the airway obstruction is relieved, influx of oxygen to the alveolus increases back to normal, leading to a rise in the alveolar and arterial oxygen tensions. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) 5. For what complications is this patient at risk if this problem goes untreated? Untreated OSA lead to a combination of metabolic, cardiovascular and cognitive/behavioral complications. From a metabolic and cardiovascular standpoint, untreated OSA causes sympathetic nervous system activation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypercoagulability and metabolic dysregulation, which lead to insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including systemic hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure. These risks have been more clearly established in adults than in children but increasing evidence suggests that problems such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and right ventricular dysfunction can be seen in the pediatric population as well. Beyond these metabolic and cardiovascular complications, another major problem associated with OSA is excessive daytime sleepiness and its associated cognitive and/or behavioral problems. In children, for example, untreated OSA is associated with both externalizing behavioral problems, such as impulsivity, hyperactivity, inattention and aggression and possibly internalizing behavioral problems including anxiety, depressed mood and impaired emotion regulation. In the pediatric population, impaired concentration can adversely affect performance in school while in adults it can be associated with poor work performance and increased risk of motor vehicle collisions. 6. What is the most appropriate treatment and what is the mechanism by which this treatment provides benefit? In general, the most important intervention in the management of OSA is to alleviate the airway obstruction. One of the main ways of doing this is through application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This can be applied during sleep through either a tight-fitting mask that surrounds the nose and mouth or through a variety of devices capable of applying pressure through the nostrils alone. CPAP improves obstructive sleep apnea by creating a pneumatic splint that maintains airway patency during sleep. More specifically, application of CPAP raises pressure within the airway lumen (Pin), thereby increasing transmural pressure and increasing the diameter of the airway. The amount of pressure needed to maintain airway patency is assessed during the overnight polysomnogram and varies from patient to patient depending on variety of factors. 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) The specific treatment approach varies between children and adults. Because adeno-tonsillar hypertrophy is a common cause of pediatric OSA, children with confirmed OSA and adenotonsillar hypertrophy are typically referred for adenotonsillectomy as the initial intervention. CPAP is used in those children with residual OSA following surgery or those who develop OSA in the absence of significant adenotonsillar hypertrophy. In adults, CPAP is considered the first line therapy. Surgical techniques and oral appliances are occasionally used but are considered second-line interventions. Patients should also be counseled to avoid alcohol and sedatives close to bedtime as these can exacerbate the airway dynamics described above. In both groups of patients, positional therapy can be considered when the severity of OSA varies based on sleep position and other treatments are not effective. For example, because OSA is usually worse in the supine position, patients can use special pillows, head of bed elevation and other tactics to avoid sleeping flat on their back. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 9 \\n10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 3 A 53 year-old man presents to clinic with his wife who is concerned that he is more sleepy than normal during the day. He sleeps about 8 hours per night but does not feel refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. He was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea several years ago but stopped using his CPAP machine because he did not like the facemask. His other medical problems include Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. On review of systems, he notes difficulty breathing on exertion for the past year as well as when he is in the supine position. He works as a truck driver, quit smoking 25 years ago and drinks 1-2 beers several nights a week before bed. On examination, his vitals include: temperature 37.6°, BP 153/85, HR 89, RR 11, SpO2 88% breathing air. His BMI is 45 kg/m2. He has a large neck circumference, a small mouth opening and the back of his tongue obstructs the view of his uvula. His breath sounds are diminished throughout and he has no crackles. His heart sounds are distant and hard to appreciate. His neck veins cannot be appreciated. His abdomen is obese and non-tender and he has 2+ bilateral lower extremity edema. At the conclusion of your visit, he is sent for several studies. His chest radiograph is as follows: An arterial blood gas is obtained while he is breathing ambient air and reveals: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) 7.36 65 61 HCO3- (mmol/L) 34 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 11 \\n Case 3 (continued) Pulmonary function tests reveal the following: Predicted Measured % Predicted Parameter FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) RV (Liters) DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) 4.0 3.2 0.8 6.0 2.0 25.70 3.0 2.4 0.8 4.6 1.6 21.10 75 75 - 77 80 83 12 1. How do the findings on the chest radiograph correlate with what you observe on the pulmonary function tests? The pulmonary function tests demonstrate a low FEV1 and low FVC with a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio. The TLC is decreased, confirming that the patient has a restrictive ventilatory defect. This corresponds to the low lung volumes that are seen on the chest radiograph. The figure below shows a comparison between this patient\\'s film and that of a patient with normal lung volumes. The radiograph also demonstrates that he has a lot of soft tissue, which contributes to the low lung volumes and restrictive pattern by making it difficult for the chest wall to expand normally. The DLCO is normal, telling us that the surface area for gas exchange is preserved. This would correspond to the fact that the lung fields are largely clear of opacities on the chest radiograph. The lower lung zones do have a hazy appearance but this is related to the overlying soft tissue on his chest wall, which decreases x-ray beam penetration of the chest when the film is taken and leads the lungs to look whiter in that area. 2. What changes would you expect to see in his functional residual capacity and respiratory system compliance? FRC, the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of tidal exhalation, is determined by the balance between the tendency of the lung to recoil to a lower volume and the tendency of the chest wall to recoil out to a larger volume. Due to the extra weight of all of the extra soft-tissue from his obesity, the chest wall has a decreased tendency to recoil out to a larger volume. As a result, in the battle between the lung and chest wall that determines FRC, the system moves to a lower volume. This is demonstrated in the figure below where the CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) thickness of the arrows represents the strength of the recoil forces for the lung (white) and chest wall (black line). The grey area is the pleural space. We would expect the compliance of the respiratory system to be decreased in this patient as well, as the weight of the extra soft tissue on the chest wall makes it more difficult to expand the chest on inspiration. To maintain a normal tidal volume in the face of the decreased compliance, the individual must generate a greater change in pressure on inhalation than if compliance were normal. While some patients can maintain this increased work of breathing, in other cases, patients simply breathe at lower tidal volumes, as less work is required to expand the system to the decreased volume. 3. What mechanisms account for the PaCO2 observed on his arterial blood gas? The PaCO2 is increased, indicating that this patient has hypoventilation. Given that this individual has a markedly increased BMI (45 kg/m2), this finding indicates that he likely has the Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. Recall that the PaCO2 reflects the balance between the amount of CO2 produced in the tissues and the amount eliminated by alveolar ventilation. These individuals have multiple problems that lead to problems maintaining sufficient alveolar ventilation. Several of these problems involve abnormal respiratory mechanics: Impaired chest wall function: Due to the decreased respiratory system compliance, these individuals tend to breathe at lower tidal volumes. Because anatomic dead-space is fixed, the lower tidal volume increases the dead space fraction and the individual must generate a higher minute ventilation to sustain adequate alveolar ventilation. The decreased compliance increases the work of breathing, however, making it difficult to maintain this higher minute ventilation. Impaired muscle function: Biochemical disturbances in severe obesity impair inspiratory muscle function, decreasing the ability to sustain the work of breathing. Displacement of the diaphragm: Central fat distribution displaces the diaphragm upward, impairing descent of the diaphragm on inhalation, particularly in the supine position (This is why he has more dyspnea when supine). Upward displacement of the diaphragm also causes increased airway resistance (airway resistance is increased at lower lung volumes due to the loss of tethering effect by the surrounding alveoli), which further increases the increased work of breathing. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 13 \\nCase 3 (continued) Beyond these mechanical issues, patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome also have impaired ventilatory responses to CO2. In particular, the slope of the relationship between minute ventilation and PaCO2 is decreased. As a result, when PaCO2 begins to rise due to the mechanical issues noted above, they do not have the same stimulus to increase ventilation as would be seen in normal individual. The impaired ventilatory responsiveness in Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome is largely thought to be acquired in adulthood rather than being a heritable trait. It does not develop in all individuals, however, and, as a result, not all individuals with markedly increased BMI develop Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome. 4. A complete blood count is checked and his hemoglobin concentration is noted to be 16.5 g/dL (normal 13-15 g/dL). How do you account for this result? Due to his chronic hypoventilation, this patient has a chronically low alveolar PO2 and, as a result, a chronically low arterial PO2 (chronic hypoxemia). As described in Chapter 2, one of the physiologic responses in serum erythropoietin concentrations. When sustained, as you would expect it to be in a patient with chronic hypoxemia, this causes an increase in hemoglobin concentration over a period of days to weeks that helps maintain arterial oxygen content and delivery in the face of the low PaO2. to hypoxemia increase is an Another complication that can develop in patients such as this is pulmonary hypertension (increased pulmonary artery pressure). As mentioned in Chapter 2 and discussed further in Chapter 13 and Conference 7, alveolar hypoxia triggers constriction of the pulmonary arterioles, leading to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary artery pressure. While this can be a transient phenomenon (e.g., someone who climbs to the summit of a high mountain then descends quickly to sea level) in patients with chronic alveolar hypoxia, such as those with the Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome or very severe COPD, the increase in pulmonary artery pressure is sustained over time, often with significant adverse consequences for the patient. 5. What is the most appropriate intervention to address his hypoxemia? Because the PaCO2 is increased, we know that hypoventilation is at least one cause of this patient\\'s hypoxemia. Using the alveolar gas equation, we can determine that the average PAO2 is 69 mm Hg and, as a result, the (A-a)ΔO2 is 8 mm Hg. This is a normal value, indicating that no other processes are playing a role. Hypoventilation is the sole cause of his hypoxemia in this patient\\'s particular case. Many patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome also have low VA/Q and shunt due to atelectasis and impaired ventilation of basilar lung regions but that is not present in this case. 14 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\n Case 3 (continued) While we can improve the alveolar and arterial PO2 by placing him on supplemental oxygen, the better solution is to fix his hypoventilation. In the long-term, this is best achieved through weight loss. Given the difficulties of achieving and sustaining weight loss through dietary and lifestyle modifications alone, some individuals pursue bariatric surgery as a means to achieve this goal. Modulation of ventilation through use of respiratory stimulants, such as progesterone and acetazolamide, has not been shown to be effective in this situation, but is sometimes considered in patients with adequate pulmonary function. Another important intervention is use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nocturnal non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to prevent upper airway obstruction and worsening hypoventilation during sleep. Patients awaken with a lower PaCO2 in the morning than they would without this therapy, which allows them to start the day from a better baseline. Patients should also avoid use of other agents that might depress ventilation further. This patient, for example, should consider eliminating alcohol consumption, and should avoid sedatives (e.g., benzodiazepines) or opiate pain medications that are known to suppress ventilatory drive. It is particularly important to avoid use of these substances right before sleep. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 15 \\n16 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 4 A 57 year-old man was admitted to the intensive care unit after presenting with worsening dyspnea. He has had problems with exertion over a several month period that limited him to walking only two blocks before having to stop and rest. In the past few days, however, it has become markedly worse and he is now out of breath at rest. He also noted increasing weight and difficulty putting on his shoes and socks. He has a 40 pack-year history of smoking and a history of coronary artery disease and hypertension. He was formerly on medications for those issues but has not been taking them for over a year because he lost his insurance after being laid off. Before that, he had a long career working in the shipyards. On exam, he is afebrile with a blood pressure of 117/87 and heart rate of 93. He is using accessory muscles of respiration. His neck veins cannot be visualized due to his body habitus. On lung auscultation, he has bilateral expiratory wheezes. On cardiac exam, the PMI is displaced laterally and he has an S3. His abdominal exam is unremarkable except for edema of the lower abdominal wall. He has 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema and chronic venous stasis changes in his lower extremities. A chest radiograph obtained in the Emergency Department showed the following: An echocardiogram was performed immediately following admission. Two clips from this echocardiogram can be found on the course website. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 17 \\nCase 4 (continued) 1. Based on the patient\\'s history alone, what are the possible causes of his worsening dyspnea? The two most common categories of problems that lead to chronic dyspnea in a patient in this age range are pulmonary diseases and cardiac diseases. From a pulmonary disease standpoint, his extensive smoking history places him at risk for COPD, while he may have had exposure to asbestos while working in the shipyards, which could lead to the development of asbestosis. He could also have pulmonary hypertension, which causes worsening dyspnea and, in severe cases, weight gain from right heart failure and edema formation. From a cardiac disease standpoint, the history would be concerning for a worsening cardiomyopathy with the primary risk factors being his untreated coronary artery disease and hypertension. Severe obesity can also contribute to worsening dyspnea, as it is difficult to ambulate while carrying the extra weight. The fact that he mentions difficult putting on his shoes and socks, however, argues against his weight gain being simply related to worsening obesity (in obesity weight does not accumulate in the lower legs as much as other areas) and points more to increasing edema as the source of the problem. Severe chronic anemia would also be another potential source of worsening dyspnea. A common cause of this is iron deficiency anemia from ongoing slow gastrointestinal blood losses. This is less likely given the lack of history about black, tarry stools or other sources of bleed loss. 2. What do the physical exam, chest radiograph and echocardiogram suggest is the most likely diagnosis? The data provided in the case, strongly suggest that his worsening dyspnea is related to a cardiomyopathy, specifically heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, rather than the other potential causes outlined above. On examination, he has a displaced PMI, an S3 and extensive peripheral edema, all findings seen in patients with heart failure. The noteworthy finding in the chest radiograph is a markedly enlarged cardiac silhouette. He also has some bilateral opacities (left greater than right) that are more prominent in the hilar region. Together, these findings are consistent with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. The clip from the echocardiogram confirms the presence of a cardiomyopathy. The chambers are all markedly dilated, particularly the left ventricle, and appear hypokinetic, indicating that the ejection fraction is reduced due to a loss of contractility. Further information would be necessary to determine the underlying cause of his heart failure (e.g., ischemic vsvalvular vsidiopathic). One might be tempted to think this was asthma or COPD given the fact that he had wheezing on exam. Importantly, wheezing is not specific for those entities and can occur with any process that causes airflow obstruction, including in some cases, heart failure. When fluid leaks out of the vascular space into the interstitium of the lung, it can accumulate in the peribronchial regions. This process, known as peribronchial cuffing, exerts inward pressure on the airways (i.e., it decreases the transmural pressure by raising pressure outside the airway). This narrows the airway diameter and can lead to wheezing. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"cardiac wheezing\" or \"cardiac asthma.\" It is a useful reminder that not all that wheezes is COPD or asthma. Instead, wheezes point to the presence of airflow obstruction, which can occur for a variety of reasons. 18 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\nCase 4 (Continued) On rounds several days into his admission, the nurse states that he had an odd breathing pattern while asleep the prior night. A movie clip of his breathing pattern is obtained and can be viewed on the canvas website. 3. In the blank figure below, draw in the pattern of chest wall and abdominal movement and nasal airflow you would expect to see in this patient on an overnight polysomnogram. The key finding in the video clip is that the patient has long pauses in his breathing. During these periods of apnea, there is no movement in his chest wall or abdomen, indicating that he is not making breathing efforts due to a lack of inputs from his central respiratory centers. As a result, on the recordings from a polysomnogram, you would expect to see periods of airflow accompanied by chest and abdominal movements punctuated by periods of no airflow in which chest and abdominal movements are also absent. In addition, when the patient is breathing, the size of his chest and abdominal excursion and the amount of airflow vary from breath to breath in what appears to be a crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Excursion and airflow increase over several breaths then decrease over several breaths before apnea ensues. This pattern is depicted in the figure above and is the classic pattern seen in central sleep apnea. 4. What is the mechanism for the breathing pattern observed during sleep? This problem develops during sleep due to instability in the ventilatory control system. All individuals have what is referred to as the \"apnea threshold\" a level of PaCO2 below which the central respiratory centers stop sending signals for the individual to breathe. This threshold is suppressed in the awake state but becomes active during sleep. Due to hypoxemia and stimulation of pulmonary vagal irritant receptors by pulmonary vascular congestion, some patients with severe heart failure have increased minute and alveolar ventilation, which lowers their PaCO2. If PaCO2 falls below the apnea threshold, breathing ceases. Because there is no ventilation during an apneic period, PaCO2 rises and eventually crosses the apnea threshold. The signal of the rising PaCO2 is received by the chemoreceptors but because the chemoresponsiveness of the central and peripheral receptors is increased in chronic heart failure, there is an exaggerated response to the rising CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers 19 \\nCase 4 (Continued) PaCO2. Ventilation goes up significantly, driving the PaCO2 down and, importantly, back below the apnea threshold. This causes another apnea and repetition of the cycle. This process is exacerbated by the prolonged circulation time that occurs due to poor pump function in heart failure. Increased circulatory time lengthens the time it takes blood leaving the heart to reach chemoreceptors. This delays central chemoreceptor responses to changing PCO2, resulting in overshoot and undershoot of ventilatory drive. 5. What is the most appropriate treatment for the breathing pattern observed during sleep? The most appropriate treatment strategy is to diagnose and treat the underlying heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. After pursuing a work-up to evaluate the cause of this process, the patient should be put on an appropriate medication regimen. This will vary based on the severity of his heart failure as assessed by the New York Heart Association Class but in general, would include beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and diuretics as needed to maintain euvolemia. Beta-blockers would not be started until he is euvolemic and no longer in his current decompensated state. Sicker patients with Class III-IV disease may also be placed on spironolactone and digoxin. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) may also yield benefit in these patients through several mechanisms. As with invasive mechanical ventilation, application of CPAP through a tight-fitting mask raises intrathoracic pressure, which subsequently leads to decreases in both preload and afterload, changes that are of benefit to the failing heart. Improved pump function shortens circulatory time, which helps stabilize the ventilatory control system. CPAP also raises alveolar pressure during exhalation, thereby raising the transmural pressure across the wall of the alveolus. This prevents atelectasis and improves ventilation-perfusion matching. The subsequent improvement in oxygenation may decrease some of the hypoxemia-driven increase in minute ventilation and the excess ventilatory responses to CO2 that help drive the PaCO2 down below the apnea threshold. Improved oxygenation, which may also be achieved through application of supplemental oxygen, may also decrease enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity that contributes to the pathogenesis of heart failure. 20 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 4 Answers \\n CPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Cases Conference 8: Answers to Why Is This Patient Febrile and Coughing Day: 26 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 52 year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of dyspnea, cough productive of yellow-brown sputum and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. She has a history of Hepatitis C but denies other medical problems. She drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication on a daily basis, and has smoked one pack of cigarettes a day for about 30 years. She is not currently working, lives in an apartment with her boyfriend and has not traveled out of the Seattle area in over 10 years. On arrival, her vitals include a temperature of 39.0°C, BP of 78/46, HR 134, RR 40 and an oxygen saturation of 70% breathing air. She is placed on a high flow nasal cannula with an FIO2 of 0.8 after which her oxygen saturation rises to 75%. On physical exam, she is diaphoretic and using accessory muscles of respiration. She has dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds at her left base. She is tachycardic with a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur heard throughout the precordium. Her skin is moist with warm hands and feet and some mottling of her distal extremities. Her labs reveal a WBC 1.57 x 103cells/uL with a predominance of neutrophils and some immature granulocytes. A portable chest radiograph is obtained and is shown below: An arterial blood gas was obtained while the patient was on the high flow nasal cannula and revealed: pH 7.08 PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 58 45 - (mmol/L) Lactate (mEq/L) 16 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 1 \\nCase 1 (continued) 1. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? The lung volumes are adequate. The bones and soft tissues are normal and there are two breast shadows. The trachea is on the midline. The aortic knob is visible but the descending aorta is obscured. The right hilar structures are normal but the left hilar structures are obscured. The heart size appears normal. The left hear border is visible. Retrocardiac lung markings are not visualized. The right hemidiaphragm is rounded and visualized along its entire length. There are no right lung opacities. There is a dense left lower lung opacity that obscures the left hemidiaphragm, indicative of a left lower lobe process. 2. What is(are) the cause(s) of her hypoxemia? Why is the PaCO2 elevated and what does that tell you about her ability to tolerate her current clinical circumstances? The patient is not at high altitude and, therefore, low PIO2 is not a cause of hypoxemia. The PaCO2 is elevated at 58 mm Hg, indicating that hypoventilation is contributing to her hypoxemia. High flow face nasal cannula yields a reliable FIO2. As a result, it is possible to calculate an approximate alveolar-arterial oxygen difference. Using an FIO2 of 0.8 and assuming R = 0.8, the alveolar PO2 is 498 mm Hg. The alveolar-arterial oxygen difference is 452 mm Hg, markedly elevated. Because the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference remained elevated despite supplemental oxygen administration, she most likely has shunt as the predominant cause of her hypoxemia. PaCO2 is determined by the balance between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation. There are multiple aspects of her presentation suggestive of severe infection, which would raise her CO2 production. The fact that PaCO2 is increased tells us that she is not able to maintain adequate alveolar ventilation to deal with this change in her CO2 production. This clinical picture is very concerning and suggests she is not tolerating her clinical circumstances well. Normally, hypoxemia triggers an increase in minute ventilation (hypoxic ventilatory response). In addition, people commonly raise their minute ventilation to compensate for increased CO2 production and metabolic acidoses (in this case, a lactic acidosis). Such increases in minute ventilation raise alveolar ventilation, leading to hyperventilation and decreased PaCO2. The fact that her PaCO2 is increased, therefore, suggests she cannot maintain her minute ventilation at an appropriate level. It is likely that her respiratory muscles are fatiguing in the face of a very high work of breathing and she is developing ventilatory failure. A gram stain is performed on an expectorated sputum sample and reveals the following: 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers \\nCase 1 (continued) 3. What is the most likely etiology of this patient\\'s presentation? Suppose this same problem developed 9 days into a hospital admission for another medical issue. How would that change your assessment of the likely etiology of her presentation? This patient\\'s clinical presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of pneumonia. Because she is presenting right out of the community and has not had recent contact with the health care system, she would best be labeled as having Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) The primary causative organisms of CAP include S.Pneumoniae (most common), Moraxella Catarrhalis, Haemophilus Influenza, Legionella, Chlamydophila and Mycoplasma. In certain situations, such as a patient sick enough to get into the ICU, users of injection drugs or following an influenza infection, you would also strongly consider Staphylococcus Aureus on the differential diagnosis. The sputum gram stain in this case helps you narrow down the list of possible causative organisms, as the finding of gram positive cocci in pairs and chains indicates she most likely is infected by S.Pneumoniae. If this patient developed symptoms and signs of pneumonia after being in the hospital more than 2 days, we would need to consider a different set of organisms on the differential diagnosis. In particular, gram-negative rods including organisms such as pseudomonas, klebsiella, citrobacter, serratia and E.Coli and others are much more of a concern now than they would be in a patient with no recent contact with the hospital or a nursing facility presenting with pneumonia. This is an important distinction to make as it has a significant effect on your choice of empiric antibiotics for these patients. 4. What are the patient\\'s risk factors for this presentation and what effect do they have on host defenses? This patient has several risk factors for pneumonia. Cigarette smoke paralyzes then destroys cilia in the respiratory mucosa, thereby impairing mucociliary clearance and elimination of pathogenic bacteria from the respiratory tract. This process is made worse by the fact that cigarette smoke also triggers increased airway mucous production, which further impeded airway clearance. The patient is also a heavy user of alcohol. Severe alcohol intoxication increases the risk of pneumonia by blunting protective airway reflexes. These reflexes are a key defense mechanism against aspiration, a major contributor to the development of pneumonia. 5. What is(are) the most appropriate management step(s) to pursue at this time? There are two important components to the early management of this patient\\'s case: eradication of infection and provision of respiratory support. With regard to the former, even though the gram stain is suggestive of S.Pneumoniae, the patient should be put on broader empiric coverage until the final culture results are available. Guidelines jointly issued by the Infectious Disease Society of America and the American Thoracic Society recommend that patients being admitted to an inpatient unit with CAP should be started on either Ceftriaxone plus (Azithromycin or Doxycycline) (either of these last two are added to cover for atypical organisms - legionella, chlamydophila and mycoplasma). An alternative is a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin or moxifloxacin). In patients sick enough to be admitted to the ICU or with particular risk factor profiles, vancomycin should be added to cover for S.Aureus. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 3 \\nCase 1 (continued) With regard to respiratory support, the patient is clearly hypoxemic with a significant degree of shunt physiology and therefore requires some intervention to improve her oxygenation. In addition, the elevated PaCO2 indicates that she is not ventilating adequately and requires further support to maintain the work of breathing. The most appropriate way to address both of these issues is to intubate her and initiate invasive mechanical ventilation. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation, in which positive pressure is applied to the airways through the use of a tight-fitting mask, can be used to provide ventilatory support to certain classes of patients with inadequate ventilation (e.g., a COPD exacerbation) but given her overall clinical instability (severe hypoxemia, evolving septic shock) and the fact that she is likely to need support for at least a few days, non-invasive ventilation would not be appropriate in this situation. Once on invasive mechanical ventilation, the first step to address her hypoxemia would be to administer a high inspired oxygen fraction (FIO2). The response you can expect to that intervention would be a function of the degree of shunt (i.e., the magnitude of her shunt fraction), as demonstrated in the figure below. If the shunt fraction is only mildly increased above the normal level (5%), the PaO2 will rise to a significant extent. If, however, the shunt fraction is very large, then the PaO2 will not increase to a significant extent even with a very high FIO2. Given the size of her opacity and the fact that it is in the lower lobe, which receives a lot of blood flow, it is likely that her shunt fraction is very high and that PaO2 will not increase significantly with the increase in her FIO2. In this situation, other measures beyond the scope of this course would be necessary to support her oxygenation.

The cough is worse at night, is not productive of sputum and is often quite loud. The child has also had a stuffy, runny nose and has felt warm to the touch over these three days. The mother thinks her daughter may have been wheezing the previous night. She is not drooling, has been swallowing and eating normally and has not had emesis or diarrhea. Aside from a history of eczema, the child is otherwise healthy and has had normal growth and development. There is no family history of asthma but her 6 year-old brother has been ill with cold symptoms. Her parents are migrant farm workers who entered the country as part of the Guest Worker program. They anticipate leaving town to work on another harvest in a few months. The patient is up-to-date on her immunizations, having been taken by her parents to occasional migrant worker clinics in towns where they are working (Further information at: https://www.farmworkerjustice.org/advocacy-and-programs/guestworker-programs). On exam, her vitals include temperature 37.5°C, blood pressure 90/56, heart rate 140, respiratory rate 36 and SpO2 95% breathing ambient air. She is alert and makes good eye contact but appears in mild respiratory distress. Her cry is hoarse and her cough sounds somewhat like a seal. She is not drooling, has clear mucus rhinorrhea and no nasal flaring. The pharynx is slightly injected, but there is no tonsilar enlargement or asymmetry. On lung exam she has subcostal retractions and some mild stridor, which worsens when agitated. There are no wheezes or crackles. Her heart rate is rapid and regular without murmurs. She has no rashes or mottling and her extremities appear well- perfused. Laboratory studies are not ordered. A plain radiograph of the neck is shown below. program found guest worker can be on the CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 5 \\nCase 2 (continued) 1) What is the differential diagnosis for this child\\'s presentation? What clinical features help you narrow this differential? There are several important items to consider on the differential diagnosis including laryngotracheobronchitis (also known as croup; associated with parainfluenza virus), epiglottitis (associated with haemophilus influenza Type B), bronchiolitis (associated with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus among other viruses), pertussis infection (a.k.a. whooping cough) and foreign body aspiration. In this case, the combination of inspiratory stridor, barking cough and hoarse voice point towards a diagnosis of croup. Factors that point you away from epiglottis include the fact that the child is non-toxic appearing, afebrile, swallowing normally and not drooling. The normal swallow and lack of drooling, as well as the lack of a history of a choking episode, would point against a foreign body aspiration. Pertussis infection can cause a prominent cough but the cough is typically paroxysmal in nature and present for longer duration. The fact that the child is up-to-date on her vaccinations makes this less likely as well. Bronchiolitis can be associated with cough, coryza and rhinorrhea but, given that it primarily affects the lower airways, it typically causes wheezing, a finding not seen in this child. A key clinical feature in this case is the distinction between wheezing and stridor. The mother mentioned the word \"wheezing\" but this finding was not present on exam. In fact, misperception of the meaning of this term is common among patients, their caregivers and providers and it is important to clarify as best as possible what they mean when they use that term. Stridor refers to a monophonic sound that develops as a result of narrowing of the upper airway in tracheal or laryngeal obstruction. It is typically heard on inhalation when airway pressure falls relative to pressure outside the airway and the degree of obstruction increases. Wheezing, on the other hand, refers to high-pitched, polyphonic sounds caused by narrowing of the peripheral airways. It is more commonly heard on exhalation when airway diameter narrows as lung volumes decrease and radial traction is lost. Distinguishing between the two entities helps narrow the differential diagnosis in this case as stridor is a feature of croup, epiglottitis and foreign body aspiration but is not seen with bronchiolitis, which is more commonly associated with wheezing. 6 2) How would you interpret the radiograph? The main finding in the film is airway narrowing in the subglottic region (white arrows in the image below). This is often described as an \"Inverted V\" sign or the \"Steeple sign\" and is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of laryngotracheobronchitis (croup). Examples of a normal airway and a croup airway are in the bottom of the figure on the next page. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) 3) What features of this toddler\\'s airway anatomy and respiratory mechanics make it difficult for her to cope with the stress of this illness? Compared to an adult, the laryngeal structures are floppier and the muscle activity responsible for maintaining airway tone is less mature. As a result, infants are more prone to airway collapse on inspiration, particularly when they generate very negative airway pressures while trying to overcome obstructive lesions in the upper airways, as can happen in croup and epiglottitis. Because airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius raised to the fourth power, the same degree of airway narrowing (e.g., 1mm) in an infant and an adult has a far greater impact on airway resistance in the infant, whose airways are already much smaller at baseline. One way to maintain airflow in the presence of increased resistance is to lower airway pressure further and generate a greater pressure gradient for flow. Infants have less ability to do this compared to adults. Because their ribs are more horizontal than in adults, their motion is somewhat restricted. This limits their ability to increase thoracic volume on inspiration, which, based on the principles of Boyle\\'s Law, is a key factor in decreasing airway pressure on inhalation. Finally, infant respiratory muscles also have less mass and fewer fatigue-resistant fibers than in the adult, which limits their ability to sustain high workloads. 4) What is the most appropriate treatment approach at this time? Several treatment modalities are typically used in laryngotracheobronchitis. Corticosteroids are administered to decrease laryngeal mucosa edema and have been shown to decrease the need for hospitalization and length of stay in the emergency department or hospital. Nebulized epinephrine can also decrease airway edema by promoting arteriolar vasoconstriction in the upper airway mucosa thereby decreasing capillary hydrostatic pressure and promoting fluid resorption from the mucosa. Humidified air or oxygen are CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) often given but have not been demonstrated in research studies to improve symptoms. Antibiotics and cough suppressants have no role in management. 5) How do the family\\'s socioeconomic circumstances affect the care the child receives for this illness? What solutions can you envision on a local level to address these problems? This patient was brought by her family to the emergency department for care of a problem that can quite often be managed in a less acute setting. There are several factors that likely contributed to their decision to access care in this manner. First, and perhaps most important, being migrant farm workers, they likely lack health insurance. As a result, access to many urgent care or primary care clinics that can normally handle this problem may be severely limited, as many clinics do not take uninsured patients. Second, if both parents work during the daytime, it may be difficult for one of them to get time away from work to take their daughter to an outpatient clinic during normal operating hours. 8 When problems like those faced by this patient are lodged not just in the physiology of the illness, but in greater socioeconomic factors, solutions must be pursued on a systems level. There is no single approach that works best but several options could be considered. If for example, migrant farm workers travel between regular spots on a harvest circuit, it might be possible to arrange short-term or traveling clinics that move between sites on a similar schedule. Other considerations would be to extend Medicaid to guest workers or to bring clinic resources closer to the patients and at more convenient times. An example of the latter approach is that of the SeaMar Community Health Centers who provide care to nearly 250,000 people in 9 Washington Counties, 90% of who have incomes below the federal poverty level. This organization has made steady efforts through its history to bring care closer to their patients, by expanding resources in the 9-county area. Information about their programs can be obtained here: https://www.seamar.org/promotores-program.html. Such changes are obviously not easy as expansion of care requires financial resources while interventions such as extending Medicaid to guest workers would require legislative action that may be difficult in the current polarized political climate. Further information on issues related to access to medical resources, including an emphasis on community-level engagement can be found through the Healthy People 2020 initiative: http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Access-to-Health-Services.

He also notes that his clothes have become very loose during this time. Aside from several episodes of pneumonia when he was a child, he has no other past medical history. He is marginally housed and has spent time living in the shelters for many years. He is not aware of any sick contacts with pulmonary disease. He smokes a few cigarettes per week, and works as an itinerant laborer on construction projects in the city. Physical exam reveals a slightly ill- appearing man with mild temporal wasting, decreased muscle bulk in all extremities and bronchial breath sounds heard over the right anterior chest. His chest radiograph is shown below. 1. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? The lung volumes are normal. The patient is thin. The bones are normal. The trachea is normal caliber and remains on the midline. The aortic knob is normal. There is hilar fullness on the left. The heart size is normal with clear borders bilaterally and visible retrocardiac markings. The diaphragms are rounded bilaterally, visualized along their entire length and both costophrenic angles are sharp. There are bilateral upper lobe opacities and evidence of cavities bilaterally as well (black arrows in the image on the next page). The minor fissure is outlined on its superior margin by opacity and is shifted upward (white arrows). CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 9 \\nCase 3 (continued) 2. What features of his presentation argue against this being a case of community- acquired pneumonia? Bacterial pneumonia should always be considered on the differential diagnosis of patients who present with fever, productive cough and pulmonary opacities on chest radiograph. However, there are several features of the presentation that are not typical of this diagnosis. In particular, the time course is not consistent with bacterial pneumonia as most cases usually develop over a few days at most rather than the several week duration in this patient. More indolent bacterial pneumonia can be seen but this is a less common presentation. Significant weight loss is also not common with routine bacterial pneumonia because symptoms develop over too short a time period to cause this problem. The clinical history (time course of his symptoms, weight loss and blood streaked sputum and the fact that he has spent time living in shelters as well as the chest radiograph findings (upper lobe opacities with cavitation) place TB very high on the differential diagnosis. While routine community-acquired pneumonia pathogens are unlikely as noted above, other infectious processes such as nocardia or fungal pneumonia would also be considered. 3. What diagnostic interventions are warranted at this time? Given that TB is at the top of the differential diagnosis, appropriate isolation procedures should be implemented to decrease the risk of transmitting the infection to others. Depending on his housing situation, he may be sent home and instructed to remain there until the work-up is complete or he may be admitted to the hospital under respiratory isolation precautions. Testing should include serial sputum samples for AFB stain and culture. If he is sent home, sputa can be collected from home and brought to the diagnostic laboratory. Nucleic acid amplification testing should be performed on the specimen to facilitate diagnosis. If your clinical suspicion is high enough, you should even consider starting anti-tuberculous treatment before culture results are finalized. When the suspicion of active pulmonary TB is high enough to consider empiric TB treatment, inform the local health department where the patient lives. He should also be tested for HIV given the high risk of co-infection in these cases, as HIV-TB coinfection substantially changes the medical management. 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) It is tempting to think that TB skin testing (TST) or interferon gamma release assays (IGRA, such as QuantiFERON or TSpot) would be warranted in this case. TST and IGRA have no role in the diagnosis of active disease. A positive TST/IGRA only tells you that he has been exposed to TB.It does not tell you that his current clinical findings are due to TB or some other process (e.g., cancer). Conversely, TST and in approximately 20% of patients with active TB, especially when the patient has underlying immunosuppression, as active TB itself is also known to cause anergy. TST/IGRA are reserved for identification of individuals with latent TB infection. IGRA are negative 4. The patient provides a sputum sample, which is processed appropriately in the laboratory. A slide is prepared by the lab and is shown below. What is the key finding? Given the suspicion for TB, the laboratory performed a Ziehl-Neelsen stain of the sputum sample, which demonstrates multiple acid-fast bacilli (AFB, the red, filamentous rods you see in the image). Keep in mind that the AFB seen in this sputum sample could be M.tuberculosis or one of the non-tuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., M.kansasii, M.avium). Mycobacterial cultures, which take 2-6 weeks to grow, are required to identify the organism and determine the antimicrobial sensitivity. Nucleic acid amplification testing should be performed on the sputum sample to rapidly determine whether the observed AFB are M.tuberculosis or another form of mycobacteria. Xpert MTB/RIF assay, widely used in recent years, is a nucleic acid amplification test and offers not only detection of M.tuberculosis but also identification of mutations associated with rifampin resistance. 5. What treatment should you start now? For this patient, the clinical story is suspicious enough for M.tuberculosis that he should be started on anti-TB therapy based on the sputum stain pending the final culture results. He should be placed on 4-drug therapy including isoniazid (INH), rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide, a combination sometimes referred to as RIPE.He will remain on this combination for 2 months after which time, he will complete 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 11 \\nCase 3 (continued) 6. Why did he develop signs of active disease at this point in his life? The answer to this question relates to the pathophysiology of tuberculosis described in Chapter 15 and summarized in the figure below. In this particular patient\\'s case, it is likely that he was first infected with the bacillus at some point in the past, rather than in just the past several weeks. Because his adaptive (T-cell) immunity at this point was adequate, he was able to contain the infection and remain asymptomatic. If tested during this period, he would have had a positive TB skin test or interferon-gamma release assay and been diagnosed as having Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI). The fact that he is now manifesting evidence of active disease indicates that his adaptive, or cell-mediated, immunity has waned and his immune system is no longer able to wall the bacillus off in granulomas. This is often referred to as \"reactivation\" disease. Patients presenting with reactivation TB typically have upper lobe opacities including possibly cavitary lesions, and have symptoms and an associated time course similar to those described in this case. Although the lungs are the most common sites, reactivation may also occur in other systems including the kidneys, bones, brain and peritoneum. Be aware, that while we make distinctions, particularly from a radiographic standpoint, between active TB that occurs upon initial infection (often referred to as primary TB and manifesting with hilar lymphadenopathy, with or without lower and middle lobe opacities) and reactivation TB (upper lobe opacities, cavitation), these distinctions break down in immunocompromised patients who can present with a variety of radiographic manifestations regardless of when they manifest active disease. Adaptive immunity can decline with age but can also be impaired by other factors such as acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus or use of immunosuppression following organ transplantation, TNF-alpha inhibitors (eg as part of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis) or high dose systemic corticosteroids. 12 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers \\nCase 4 A 27 year-old man presents to the emergency department with a three to four week history of dry cough and a one week history of worsening dyspnea. He denies hemoptysis and chest pain but notes some subjective fevers and unintentional weight loss. He has no history of lung disease and is not taking any medications. Following a sports-related injury several years ago, he became dependent on prescription pain medications, and one year ago started injecting heroin due to the high street cost of the pain medications, leading him to eventually lose his job. Born and raised in northern Idaho, he currently lives with several friends and has not traveled outside the Pacific Northwest except for a trip to California and Arizona several years ago. In the Emergency Department, his vitals include temperature 38.6°C, BP 119/79, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 25 and an SpO2 78% breathing ambient air. On exam, he is tachypneic and using accessory muscles of respiration. He is resonant to percussion throughout with symmetric breath sounds and fine inspiratory crackles in all fields. His neck veins are flat and he has no murmurs, lower extremity edema, lymphadenopathy or rash. His labs reveal a WBC 2.07 x 103cells/uL with 70% neutrophils and 8% lymphocytes. A portable chest radiograph is obtained and is shown below: 1. How would you interpret the chest radiograph? The lung volumes are normal. The patient is not rotated and the film is adequately penetrated. The patient is thin and there are no fractures. There is no pneumothorax. The trachea is on the midline and of normal caliber. The mediastinum is not widened. The heart is normal in size and has normal contours. The diaphragms are rounded and the costophrenic angles are sharp bilaterally, indicating there are no effusions. There are diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities, greater on the right than the left. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 13 \\n Case 4 (continued) 2. What items would you consider on the differential diagnosis for a patient presenting with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and this radiographic pattern? The finding of diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities is not specific for a single diagnosis. Instead, it merely tells you that there is something - edema fluid, blood, pus, proteinaceous material and/or cells - filling the alveolar space. The leading items to consider on the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with this imaging pattern include bacterial pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), viral pneumonia, pneumocystis pneumonia, cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. This patient\\'s fevers raises concern for an infectious etiology, but the several-week time course of his illness makes community-acquired or viral pneumonia less likely. Pneumocystis pneumonia can present with this time course, however, and remains on the differential, particularly given his history of injection drug use, which puts him at risk for HIV.The patient was initially placed on high flow oxygen by nasal cannula but subsequently worsened and required intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation. Following intubation, bronchoscopy was performed and a Gomori methenamine silver stain of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed the following: 3. Based on the results of the bronchoscopy, what is the appropriate management for the patient at this time? The key finding on the silver stain of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the presence of multiple gray/black cysts. This suggests the patient has a fungal infection, as fungi stain black on silver stain. Some of the cysts have clearly visible walls and the organisms have a variety of shapes including crescents, folded spheres, and, what are sometimes described as squished ping pong balls or deflated beach balls. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP). First-line treatment for patients diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). For patients with sulfa allergy, alternative agents such as atovaquone, clindamycin-primaquine and pentamidine can be used, but in severe cases, consideration is given to desensitizing the patient to TMP-SMX to facilitate CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 8 Answers 14 \\nCase 4 (continued) treatment. Corticosteroids are added to the treatment regimen for patients with moderate- severe disease (PaO2 < 70 mm Hg while breathing air and/or (A-a)ΔO2 > 35 mm Hg). Although PJP can develop in any immunocompromised patient, including patients on long courses of high dose corticosteroids, the overwhelming majority of adult cases are seen in HIV-positive patients with CD4+ counts < 200 cells/uL.In fact, PJP is considered an AIDS- defining opportunistic infection and should prompt diagnostic testing to confirm the presence of HIV and determine the patient\\'s viral load and CD4 count. 4. What is the primary defect in host defenses, which predisposed the patient to this infection? How does the risk of pulmonary infection vary as a function of the severity of that defect? The primary defect in host defense in HIV is impaired cellular immunity and, in particular impaired T-cell function. T-cells are not only decreased in number, but are also dysfunctional and mount inappropriate responses to T-cell-dependent antigens. Other defenses in the airways and alveolar spaces are also altered in HIV, including abnormalities in mucociliary function, soluble defense molecules in respiratory secretions and alveolar macrophage function. The risk of developing particular pulmonary infections varies in HIV depending on the patient\\'s CD4+ lymphocyte count: CD4+ Lymphocyte Count (cells/uL) < 200 < 50-100 Endemic fungi (Histoplasmosis, Coccidioidomycosis, Organisms Causing Infections Pneumocystis Cryptococcus Blastomycosis) Cytomegalovirus Toxoplasma gondii Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (e.g., MAC) Bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis can be seen at any CD4+ lymphocyte count but the risk of bacteremia with pneumonia or extrapulmonary or disseminated TB increases when counts are < 200 cells/uL.The patient remains very hypoxemic following intubation. Arterial blood gases are obtained before and after adjustment of the FIO2 and are as follows: FIO2 0.5 0.8 pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.41 7.38 50 56 39 41 - (mmol/L) 23 23 5. What is the cause of his hypoxemia? On the initial ventilator settings, the patient has a PaO2 of only 50 mm Hg. When the FIO2 is increased significantly from 0.5 to 0.8, the PaO2 rises by only 6 mm Hg. This small increase despite a large change in the FIO2 indicates that shunt, rather than low VA/Q is the primary cause of this patient\\'s hypoxemia.\\nA 25 year-old man is seen by his primary physician and on routine testing his serum creatinine is 1.4 mg/dl. His doctor notices that the lab is highlighted in red and an (H) for high appears next to it. The BUN is 15 mg/dl (normal). The only complaint the patient has is heartburn. Nephrology is consulted for possible kidney disease. a) Where does creatinine come from? Creatinine is generated from muscle at a steady rate each day. The more muscular the person is, the more creatinine they generate, and the higher their serum level of creatinine will be normally. The expected amount of creatinine on average that a person generates per day is 15-20mg/kg (female) or 20-25mg/kg (male). Obviously a skinny male may generate much less creatinine than a muscular woman. Creatinine (found in cooked meat) and creatine supplements (may be converted to creatinine) can make a small contribution to the serum creatinine. b) Does the patient have decreased kidney function? Please explain your answer. Probably. The normal range for creatinine in 0.7-1.2mg/dl, and 1.4 is above this normal range. It should be recognized that elevated levels may be due to either: a. decreased excretion of creatinine (decreased GFR or medications interfering with creatinine secretion (e.g trimethoprim).) b. increased generation of creatinine. Rarely, a very muscular person may have a creatinine of 1.4 with normal renal function. (high meat / creatine intake may contribute)) Note the BUN is normal, but this biomarker is much more variable than creatinine and can remain low in settings of increased hydration or low protein intake. c) What are the 3 ways the kidney may handle molecules that are presented to them? What are the 2 ways the kidney handles creatinine and the 2 ways they handle urea and discuss where in the kidney this happens? Molecules presented to the nephron may be filtered at the glomerulus into the tubule and / or secreted from the peritubular capillary thru the proximal tubular cells into the lumen. Once in the lumen they are then excreted in urine or may be partially or completely reabsorbed. Both creatinine and urea are small molecules and are freely filtered in the glomerular, however, creatinine is also secreted into the tubule in the proximal tubule (accounts for ~10% of excreted creatinine), whereas about 50% of filtered urea is actually reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.  2 Answers 1 \\n2. Your 70 year-old aunt (60kg) texts you that she has back pain and went to see her doctor. They have checked her creatinine and states it is 1.4 mg/dl and that she has kidney problems. She feels well otherwise. Her appetite has been good. She has nonetheless convinced herself that her kidneys are the problem and the reason she has back pain. Because you are in medical school, she figures you know how to check her kidney status. Your pulse quickens and you ask her to obtain a 24-hour urine collection. She phones back the next week and reviews her labs. She completed a urine collection for 24 hours. She swears nothing happened to her collection the second time. The results are as follows: Plasma creatinine 1.4mg/dl Urine total volume 2400ml Urine creatinine concentration = 45mg/dl 24hr urine creatinine = 1080mg/24h What do we actually measure when we discuss someone\\'s kidney function? Glomerular filtration (GFR) rate is used to quantitate renal function in the clinical setting. The total kidney GFR is equal to the sum of the filtration that occurs in all the functioning nephrons. (There are ~1,000,000 nephrons per kidney). GFR cannot be measured directly, but can be calculated using the concept of clearance. a) Define Clearance: The clearance of a substance is the volume of plasma from which that substance is completely cleared by the kidneys per unit time. Important points about clearance: 1. The units are always volume of plasma per time 2. Every substance has its own unique clearance, but the units are always the same (volume/time) 3. The clearance of some substances can be used to measure GFR.Clearance represents a theoretical volume of plasma cleared of a substance per unit time. In reality, there is no aliquot of plasma that is completed cleared of a substance as it passes through the kidney. Nevertheless, the clearance concept has considerable usefulness in the study of renal physiology, and in assessing renal function in health and disease. A substance that is freely filtered (not secreted or reabsorbed) can be used to calculate GFR.In clinical practice, the clearance of either radio-isotopic iothalamate or inulin is too cumbersome for routine use, so endogenous creatinine clearance is used. What is freely filtered at the glomerulus, not reabsorbed or metabolized by the tubules (there is some creatinine secretion (~10mls/min clearance) , so it is not a perfect molecule to calculate GFR)  2 Answers 2 \\n Creatinine clearance is usually determined using a venous blood sample and a timed urine collection (usually 24 hours). b) Is the urine specimen adequate? To determine if it is an adequate collection, you must know how much creatinine a typical person excretes per day, based on their weight. In general, women excrete men excrete 15-20mg/kg creatinine per day. 20-25mg/kg creatinine per day Your aunt\\'s creatinine excretion = UCr x V = 45mg/dl x (dl/100ml) x 2400 ml = 1080mg/24hr Is 1080mg enough creatinine? She weighs 60kg = 18mg/kg. This suggests that her collection is adequate. Very little, if any, has landed on the floor or in the refrigerator. c) What is the creatinine clearance? = (UCr x V) / PCr CCr where CCr = creatinine clearance, Ucr = urine creatinine concentration, PCr = plasma creatinine concentration, V = volume per time (usually 24hrs) Ccr = UV/P = 45mg/dl x 2400mls / 1.4mg/dl x 1440 (minutes in 24hrs) = 1080/1.4 x 1440 = 54 mls/min Normal creatinine clearance for a woman is 95ml/min +/- 20 ml/min For men, normal creatinine clearance is 120ml/min +/- 25ml/min (note, these normal values fall with aging) d) What are the limitations of using creatinine clearance to approximate GFR? Is her kidney function normal 1. The collection may be inadequate. One should always check 24hr creatinine excretion for adequacy as noted above. 2. As renal function worsens, the percentage of creatinine that is secreted increases. In the normal state, ~ 10% of the excreted creatinine is secreted. In advanced kidney disease, up to 35% may be secreted. Hence, creatinine clearance can overestimate true GFR in the presence of renal disease. (esp at low GFR) Is her kidney function normal: Based on the creatinine clearance, it appears that your aunt has abnormal renal function. e) What is the Modification of Diet and Renal Disease (MDRD) Equation, and how is it used? The MDRD equation uses serum creatinine in combination with age, sex and race to estimate GFR.Note it reports the value for the average person with that creatinine, with a certain age, sex and race, it is not the exact value for that individual (it is an estimate).  2 Answers 3 \\nThe MDRD Study equation in many cases is actually more accurate than measured creatinine clearance from 24-hour urine collections due to collection issues. The equation is: GFR = 186 x (PCr)-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if black) Where GFR is expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2, Pcr is serum creatinine expressed in mg/dl, and age is expressed in years. The MDRD Study equation was originally derived in a group of patients with chronic kidney disease (mean GFR 40 ml/min/1.73 m2) who were predominantly Caucasian (8% African American) and did not have diabetic kidney disease or kidney transplants. The MDRD Study equation has since been validated in diabetic kidney disease, kidney transplant recipients, and African Americans with non-diabetic kidney disease (AASK study). In these studies, gold standard GFR was measured with inulin or iothalamate and compared to the estimating equations. Most clinical laboratories now report GFR estimates using the MDRD Study equation. Based on the MDRD GFR equation, she has an estimated GFR (eGFR) = 48ml/min/1.73 m2 if she is African American. = 40ml/min/1.73m2 if she is of other race / ethnicity. There are significant concerns regarding the use of the race variable in this (and other) equations. These include, but not limited to: - Race is not binary, and difficult to ascertain in an individual patient - eGFR is an average value, within African American subjects there is wide variation in size, muscle mass and creatinine generation. - The race variable is not accurate in most studies of African patients - With the history of racism in medicine, the use of a racial category may have negative consequences for the patient. Are there times when the MDRD can mislead us, and we should use the 24 hour urine collection? Twenty-four-hour urine collections (or accurate iothalamate GFR) may be required to estimate GFR in conditions where the eGFR would be inaccurate: 1. Extremes of age (<18yrs, >70yrs) [Note Schwarz formula used in children] 2. Extremes of body size (very obese, very muscular, very wasted, amputations) 3. Pregnancy 3. The following data are obtained for a patient in your metabolic lab. The patient is infused with inulin and PAH (para-aminohippurate) until a steady state is achieved. Urine flow is 1584 ml/24hr, or 1.1 ml/min.  2 Answers 4 \\n Serum (mg/dl) concentration (mg/dl) Urine concentration PAH 5 2550 Glucose 75 inulin 51 0 6000 a. Inulin is usually not used clinically, but is used in the research setting. For inulin (which is filtered but is not secreted, reabsorbed or metabolized), Cin = GFR.Cin = (Uin x V) / PIn = (6000 x 1.1) / 51 = 129.4ml/min b. Renal blood flow is large in relation to the size of the kidneys (approximately 20% of the cardiac output), but only a small fraction of this is filtered. Since a portion of the blood is actually red blood cells (which are not filterable) the renal plasma flow is the amount of fluid entering the kidney which is potentially filterable. PAH is used to measure renal plasma flow. Some PAH is filtered, and when the concentration is low, virtually all of the PAH that is not filtered is secreted in to the tubule. In other words, all the PAH delivered to the kidney is excreted in the urine (CPAH = RPF) [Note: not all RPF supplies the nephrons, 10-15% supplies perinephric fat etc. and PAH in this component cannot be secreted. Accordingly, the PAH clearance actually measures what is known as the effective renal plasma flow, (ERPF). ERPF is 85-90% of total RPF. Filtration fraction (FF) = GFR / RPF.\\nRenal handling of para-aminohippurate filtration secretion (no reabsorption) plasma cleared of PAH 4. A 61 year old woman has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease thought to be due to diabetic kidney disease (she has not had a biopsy). Her blood pressure is 145/85. Labs reveal a serum creatinine of 1.2mg/dl and proteinuria (0.8g/24hrs). She is started on an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor for her hypertension and to protect her kidneys. a) What would you estimate her GFR to be? Although her serum creatinine is in the normal range (0.7-1.2mg/dl), her renal function (GFR) is not normal. You would expect a normal creatinine in a woman of this age to be in the 0.7-0.8 range (likely lower muscle mass), even though her GFR has likely decline with aging. A value of around 50mls/min could be expected given her creatinine of 1.2. This could be better estimated using an estimating equation, or a 24hr urine could be checked to measure creatinine clearance. b) After starting the ACEI, what would happen to her filtration fraction? Filtration fraction (FF) is the ratio of glomerular filtration to renal blood flow (ie GFR/RBF). A normal FF would be ~ 20% (120mls/min / 600mls/min). Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) leads to increased angiotensin II production. This is often upregulated in diabetic kidney disease. AngII acts preferentially on the efferent arteriole causing vasoconstriction, leading to increased glomerular pressure, a relative increase in GFR and an increase in filtration fraction (this exacerbates proteinuria)  2 Answers 6 \\nAn ACE inhibitor will block the effects of AngII on the efferent arteriole and cause a reduction in GFR.Renla blood flow will either be unchanged or slightly increased resulting in a decrease in the filtration fraction c) What would you expect to happen to her serum creatinine shortly after starting the ACEI? As the ACEI may lead to a decrease in GFR, this will lead to an increase serum creatinine (usually by 0.1 or 0.2mg/dl) in the short term. Although this seems counterintuitive, the reduction in glomerular pressure reduces proteinuria and causes less injury to the glomeruli / kidneys in the longer term which is protective 5. A 36 year old woman donates a kidney to her brother who has end stage kidney disease and needs a kidney transplant. Which of the following will be decreased in this woman 4 weeks after donation when back to steady state? a. Creatinine excretion b. Creatinine production c. Creatinine clearance d. Serum creatinine e. Urine creatinine The objective of this question is to recognize the difference between creatinine excretion (an amount of creatinine) and creatinine clearance (a volume, which approximates GFR (mls/min). Each day the woman generates an amount of creatinine (15-20mg/kg, lets say 1g total), and, if she is in steady state, will excrete 1g creatinine to stay in balance. If a kidney is removed, her creatinine clearance will half (eg 100mls/min -> 50mls/min). but she will continue to generate 1g creatinine per day as this is related to her muscle mass. For a few days, her serum creatinine will climb, but she will then get back into a new steady state, certainly by one month post donation. At this stage her 24h urine creatinine (U.V) will be back to her normal, proportional to her muscle mass. . At this point, as her GFR halved, her serum creatinine will have doubled, and this will allow her to excrete her 1g of creatinine again. So GFR will be decreased, but her daily creatinine excretion will remain unchanged (1g), equal to generation (Note, in the real world, the remaining single kidney actually hyperfilters and and the GFR is higher than 50% after removing one kidney) 6. A 7 year-old girl with chronic kidney disease from renal dysplasia comes to your office with complaints of frequency, urgency, dysuria and low-grade fever. You look at her urine under the microscope in your office, and see packed WBC\\'s and many bacteria. Based on the clinical picture, you suspect that she has a UTI.You decide to treat with Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole); the parent says that the child cannot swallow pills so you choose the suspension (concentration of  2 Answers 7 \\ndrug: trimethoprim 40mg and sulfamethoxazole 200 mg per 5 mL of suspension). You are not sure of the dose, so you look it up in the Pediatric Medication Formulary, and find this: UTI treatment for Children >2 months: Oral: 6-12 mg trimethoprim/kg/day divided every 12 hours (maximum 160 mg trimethoprim/dose) Dosing adjustment in renal impairment: Creatinine Clearance (mls/min). You check the patient\\'s chart and find the following information: Weight: 20kg (10th - 25th percentile) Height: 115cm (~10th percentile) Serum creatinine (checked 3 months ago, IDMS traceable method): 1.4 mg/dL 1. What is this patient\\'s estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)? What equation would you use to calculate the eGFR? What creatinine level would give a normal eGFR (>90ml/min/1.73m2)? The currently accepted equations to estimate GFR in pediatric patients were developed by George Schwartz and are called the \"Schwartz equations\". There have been several versions over the years, adjusted depending on how creatinine was measured and whether other data may be available to add greater precision to the equation. The simplest equation uses serum creatinine in mg/dL, the patient\\'s height in centimeters, and a constant, in the following format: eGFR = ((Constant) x (Height))/serum Cr The constant for boys and girls using the IDMS-traceable creatinine measurement method is 0.413. Therefore, for our patient, the eGFR would be calculated as follows: A normal GFR would be a value of 90ml/min//1.73m2 or greater. For this child, we can back-calculate using the equation to determine what would be a \"normal\" creatinine for her: eGFR = ((0.413) x (115))/1.4 = 34ml/min/1.73m2 Normal Cr = ((0.413) x (115))/90 = 0.5 mg/dL 2. Given her eGFR, is it acceptable to use this medication? If so, what would be the dose? Based on our calculation of eGFR for our patient at 34ml/min/1.73m2, we can use trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole without dose adjustment, since the eGFR is >30.  2 Answers 8 \\n(6 - 12 mg trimethoprim/kg/day) x 20kg = 120mg - 240mg trimethoprim/day Pediatric drug dosing is usually scaled to weight; sometimes it is scaled to body surface area. For this medication, the recommended dosage is 6-12 mg trimethoprim/kg/day divided every 12 hours. Note that this is a compound medication (two drugs in one) so we base our dosage on just one component (trimethoprim). The patient weighs 20kg so we would calculate the dose as: The suspension form of the drug has 40mg of trimethoprim per 5 mL, so this would be: The dose must be divided every twelve hours so this becomes: We may pick the lower end of the range for milder infections and the higher end for more serious infections. We also consider convenience of dosing - \"in between\" doses can be hard to deliver. A dose of 10ml twice a day would probably work fine and would be easy for parents to draw up in a medication syringe. (120mg - 240mg trimethoprim)/40mg of trimethoprim per 5mL = 15-30 mLs / day 15-30 mL suspension/day or 7.5 - 15mL suspension every 12 hours 3. To play it safe we send her to the lab to re-check her serum creatinine and the result turns out to be 2.3 mg/dL.What is the eGFR now? Can we still use this medication? Our patient\\'s kidney function has deteriorated over the last several months since she now has serum creatinine of 2.3mg/dL.Running this through the Schwartz equation: eGFR = ((0.413) x (115))/2.3 = 20 ml/min/1.73m2 Based on the recommendations in the formulary, we would need to cut the dose in half. So, if we previously thought that 10mL every 12 hours was OK, we should probably reduce to 5mL every 12 hours. Of interest, what creatinine would give an eGFR <15, meaning the drug should not be used? We can calculate that as well: \"Too low\" Cr = ((0.413) x (115))/15 = 3.2 mg/dL BONUS QUESTION: Why is it important to know whether the serum creatinine is checked using an IDMS traceable method when estimating GFR for pediatric patients? The isotope-dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method is the international gold standard for measuring serum creatinine. It is expensive and hard to do, so clinical labs use simplified methods. An older method, called the Jaffe (alkaline picrate) method, would read a slightly higher creatinine than do the more modern versions which align better  2 Answers 9 \\nwith the gold standard; these modern methods are called \"IDMS-traceable\" because they give similar results to IDMS itself. The current version of the Schwartz equation was developed using modern IDMS-traceable creatinine measurements; an older version of the Schwartz equation was developed based on the Jaffe method, and use a constant of 0.5 rather than the current version of 0.413. Some clinical labs still use the Jaffe method because it is very economical; when estimating GFR for children, it is important to know the method of creatinine measurement used in the lab.  2 Answers 10 \\n Case 1 CPR - Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 5 - Answers to Acid Base Disorders A 14 year-old boy returns from a family vacation. Unfortunately, he has developed diarrhea, and is having 15-17 watery bowel movements per day. On physical exam his BP is 84/50, HR 120. He is unable to stand for postural vitals. Neck veins are low. His mouth and mucous membranes are dry. The abdomen is soft, not tender. No edema 7.28 12 28 135 2.7 112 13 pH HCO3- PaCO2 Laboratory evaluation: Na: K+ Cl- HCO3 What are the laboratory parameters necessary to diagnose an acid base disorder? Four laboratory variables are necessary to accurately determine the acid base status of your patient: pH (or H+ concentration) HCO3 PaCO2 The anion gap. Arterial blood gases: The arterial pH and PaCO2 come from an arterial blood draw. This sample is known as an arterial blood gas (ABG). Blood gases are a bit trickier than a typical venipuncture to do, as you have to draw from an artery. The radial artery is usually punctured with a very small needle. The normal arterial pH is 7.35-7.45. The venous pH is slightly lower than the arterial pH due to the addition of CO2 from cell respiration (7.3-7.4) Most hospital laboratories measure the total CO2 concentration in the plasma rather than the bicarbonate concentration. This tends to cause some confusion. The total CO2 is measured by adding a strong acid to the plasma, and measuring the amount of CO2 that is generated. Most of the CO2 will result from the combination of the added acid and bicarbonate to form carbonic acid (H2CO3): HCO3- + H+ H2CO3 H20 + CO2 A small amount will also come from the dissolved CO2 (.03 x PaCO2). As a result, the total CO2 concentration normally exceeds the HCO3 concentration by 1 - 1.5 mmol/l  4 Answers 1 \\n- Note: in clinical practice total CO2 and [HCO3] are used interchangeably. The laboratories at Harborview and the University of Washington both report total CO2, not HCO3 What can we say about this patient\\'s acid - base status, based on the available information? To assess the acid base abnormality we should follow the 7 steps: Step 1 - What is the pH (normal 7.35-7.45)? pH = 7.28 implies acidemia Step 2 - Check the serum bicarbonate (HCO3) (normal 22-30mmol/l) HCO3 =12 implies metabolic acidosis Step 3 - Check the arterial PCO2 (normal 35-45mm Hg) PCO2 = 28 mm Hg implies respiratory alkalosis The pH is acidemic, implies metabolic acidosis is the primary disorder Step 4 - Assess compensatory responses Metabolic Acidosis For every 1mmol/l drop in [HCO3] expect  PCO2 by 1 mm Hg from 40 Metabolic Alkalosis For every 1mmol rise in [HCO3], expect \\xad PCO2 by 0.6 mm Hg Respiratory Acidosis Acute - Expect 1 mmol \\xad HCO3 per 10 mm Hg rise in PCO2 Chronic - Expect 3.5 mmol \\xad HCO3 per 10 mm Hg rise PCO2 Respiratory Alkalosis acute - Expect 2 mmol  HCO3 per 10 mm Hg fall PCO2 chronic - Expect 4 mmol HCO3 per 10 mm Hg fall PCO2 From the table, we would expect the PCO2 to drop ~1mm Hg for every 1mmol/L drop in HCO3 . Here they have both dropped by 12, therefore the compensation is appropriate, and the lungs are working appropriately. Step 5 - Assess the anion gap if a metabolic acidosis is present Anion Gap = Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3 This suggests a non-gap acidosis There are two major causes of a non-gap acidosis: -) = 135 - (112 + 13) = 10 1. Diarrhea 2. Renal tubular acidosis Step 6 - Assess the delta/delta if an anion gap acidosis is present (change in serum anion gap/change in bicarbonate) Step 7 - Identify the underlying cause of the acid-base disturbance 2  4 Answers \\n What is the likely etiology of the acid base disturbance? The history strongly suggests that HCO3 loss from diarrhea is the cause of the non-gap acidosis. The urinary electrolytes could be examined to estimate renal ammonium excretion (urine anion gap) to confirm this. Case 2 A 57 year old man was admitted following 3 syncopal episodes. He complained of daily vomiting for 1 week. On further questioning, he has a 7-year history of intermittent vomiting episodes. He has not seen a physician about the vomiting, nor has he taken his antipsychotic medications for > 2 years. Exam revealed a wasted man with a supine BP 110/60, pulse 80. On standing the BP was 75/60, pulse 116. Lab values: Na K Cl HCO3 141 1.8 90 40 pH PaCO2 PaO2 HCO3 7.51 52 62 38 1) What acid base disorder is present? The pH is > 7.45, so there is an alkalemia; therefore, the primary process is an alkalosis. Is the primary process metabolic or respiratory? Since the HCO3 is increased, a metabolic alkalosis is present. A metabolic alkalosis is a process resulting from the loss of H+, or addition of HCO3 which, if unopposed, raises the serum pH.2) Is the compensation appropriate? Primary process: increase in HCO3 Compensation: hypoventilation (increase in PaCO2) PaCO2 increases ~0 .6 mm Hg for every 1 mEq (in HCO3) This patient\\'s HCO3 is roughly 16 mEq/dL greater than normal (40- 24); therefore compensation should increase the pCO2 by 8-16 mm Hg. The pCO2 in the patient is 52 mm Hg. Therefore, the patient has a primary metabolic alkalosis with appropriate respiratory compensation. 3) Discuss factors involved in the generation and maintenance of the metabolic alkalosis. 1. Generation: Loss of HCl in vomitus. Gastric secretions are very acidic (pH ~2), and this loss will increase serum HCO3 levels. However, if the kidneys were working normally, this extra HCO3 would be readily excreted. 2. Maintenance: The metabolic alkalosis is maintained by volume depletion and hypokalemia. Vomiting leads to loss of NaCl/volume depletion which stimulates  4 Answers 3 \\naldosterone resulting in increased H+ secretion and K+ secretion. Despite the volume depletion, distal Na delivery is present as HCO3 that exceeds the proximal tubule reabsorption capacity reaches the CCD, carrying sodium with it. Hypokalemia potentiates this mechanism by stimulating proximal tubule ammoniagenesis increasing the number of H+ acceptors in the CCD.4) What is the main cause of hypokalemia in this patient? Only small amounts of potassium are lost in emesis (10mmol/L). Therefore, the main cause of hypokalemia is renal K excretion due to high aldosterone levels with distal Na delivery as above. 5) Discuss treatment options. Treatment must be aimed at correcting the volume (sodium), chloride, and potassium depletion. Initial IV orders might be for normal saline + 40 mmol/L of KCl. Case 3 A 12 year-old girl with Type I diabetes mellitus is brought to the emergency room by her parents in a semi-comatose condition. Physical examination revealed a thin girl with Kussmaul\\'s respiration, temp 37oC, BP 100/60 mm Hg, moderately severe volume depletion and no focal neurologic signs. Laboratory Values: Na K Cl HCO3 140 5.6 105 8 BUN creatinine Glucose 42 1.6 430 pH pCO2 pO2 7.2 20 112 What acid base disturbance is present? Acidosis is present (pH 7.2). A low HCO3 is the hallmark of a metabolic acidosis and since pCO2 is not elevated then it must be a metabolic acidosis. The metabolic acidosis is caused either by the addition of an acid or by the loss of HCO3. Compensation for Metabolic Acidosis: decrease in pCO2 (hyperventilation). PCO2 decreases 1 - 1.5 mm Hg for every 1 mmol decrease in HCO3 The HCO3 is decreased by 16, such that the pCO2 should be decreased by ~ 16. By Winter\\'s formula, PCO2 = 1.5 (HCO3) + 8 +/- 2 = 18-22 The pCO2 is 24 mm Hg, which corresponds to appropriate respiratory compensation. What is the anion gap? What are the possible causes? To further evaluate the metabolic acidosis, determine whether it is associated with an increased anion gap or not (hyperchloremic acidosis). Elevated anion gap - This category includes the life-threatening acidoses and generally reflects the addition of organic acid exogenously or endogenously. Anion gap = Na+ - [Cl- + HCO3-] = 12 normally (here the gap is 27, elevated) Metabolic Acidosis: Anion Gap Non-Gap acidosis 1. Lactic Acidosis 2. Ketoacidosis 3. Renal Failure 4. Poisons (diabetic, alcoholic, starvation) (methanol, ethylene glycol, aspirin) 1. diarrhea 2. Renal tubular acidosis The patient presented has an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to excess ketoacids. What other data would help determine the cause? The following laboratory data would be helpful to narrow the differential diagnosis: blood sugar (here 430, markedly elevated), urine and serum ketones, serum lactate level, toxicology screen. Why is the potassium elevated? The potassium is elevated because: Insulin deficiency prevents K+ movement out of cells. - - The serum hyperosmolarity causes the osmotic movement of water with K - Cellular buffering due to the acidosis may play a small role but this is mostly seen (solvent drag). in nonorganic acidosis. Note that total body K is actually depleted here 2nd to the osmotic diuresis) Case 4 A 65 year old man with a past history of type II diabetes, atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease is rushed to the emergency room with severe periumbilical abdominal pain. He has not been taking his warfarin. On physical examination he looks very unwell, pale & sweating. He is tachycardic (110/min), hypotensive 88/52 and afebrile. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examination is otherwise unremarkable. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness without signs of peritonitis. He is diagnosed with mesenteric ischemia. What acid-base disorder is present? metabolic acidosis. - The pH is acidemic (7.18), and the HCO3 is very low in keeping with a severe - The PaCO2 is reduced, and the degree of compensation is appropriate (roughly down 1mm Hg for 1mmol drop in HCO3) suggesting the compensation is adequate. - The anion gap is 136 - (98 + 8) = 30 (an increase of 18). This is a gap acidosis. - The delta delta reveals a drop (delta) in HCO3 of 24-8 =16, and an increase (delta) in anion gap of 30-12 = 18, which implies there is no mixed metabolic disorder. What is the differential diagnosis of this acid base disorder? See table above. His serum creatinine is raised, but not enough to cause this severe an acidosis. His blood sugar is not significantly elevated. The diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia suggests that he has tissue hypoxia. A serum lactate level was checked and markedly raised at 15mmol/L confirming a lactic acidosis. What underlying diagnoses may cause this presentation? Type A Anerobic Metabolism due to tissue hypoxia Shock (Hypovolemic, septic, cardiogenic, anaphylactic), lung problem (severe hypoxemia < 25-30mm Hg), hemoglobin problem (CO poisoning), increased O2 requirement (seizures, sprinting), impaired lactic acid metabolism without hypoxia Type B Liver problems (Impaired lactate clearance) (hepatotoxins, inborn errors, ethanol, tryptophan), mitochondrial disorders, impaired oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis (cyanide, mitochondrial diseases, HIV drugs), impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase (thiamine, inborn errors), D-lactic acidosis bacterial overgrowth in bowel. For each of the following cases and set of ABG results you should do the following: A) Determine whether the patient has a normal pH, acidemia or alkalemia B) Determine the respiratory acid-base status C) Determine the metabolic acid-base status D) Determine the primary acid-base disorder and whether there is any compensation E) Calculate the (A-a)ΔO2 and determine the cause of hypoxemia (if present) F) Determine the possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy Case 1 A 23 year-old woman was brought in by medics after ingesting an unknown quantity of his medications. She was comatose, unresponsive to pain and breathing 2 to 3 times per minute. An arterial blood gas obtained while breathing ambient air revealed: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.15 88 39 - (mmol/L) 29 The patient\\'s pH: Acidemia Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is high. Therefore, the patient is hypoventilating and has a respiratory acidosis. The bicarbonate is slightly elevated. Upon first glance this suggests that renal compensation may be occurring and, as a result, this is more of a chronic process. However, the bicarbonate has only gone up by 4.8 mmol/L from a normal value of 24 mmol/L.This is close to 0.1 x the increase in the PaCO2 above 40 mm Hg, which suggests that the rise in bicarbonate is consistent with that seen in an acute respiratory process, rather than a chronic one. Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The low pH (acidemia) in conjunction with the high PaCO2 tells us that the respiratory acidosis is the primary process. There is no compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 0.21 - (88 / 0.8) = 40 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 40 - 39 = 1 mm Hg. Because the PaCO2 is high, we know that hypoventilation is playing a role. The question is: does it account for all of the hypoxemia or is something else going on. Because the (A-a)DO2 is normal, there is no shunt or low VA/Q and all of the hypoxemia is explained by the hypoventilation. A normal A-a gradient is age/5 + 2 and rises with increasing FiO2.  4 Answers 7 Metabolic acid-base status: \\n Possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy The patient is likely hypoventilating as a result of whatever substance she ingested and the resultant depression of her mental status. Because the key problem is the hypoventilation, therapeutic efforts will focus on supporting her ventilation. If this were a heroin overdose, you could give her naloxone to reverse the effects of the drug. She would wake up and his minute ventilation would go up as a result. In this case, there may not be a simple antidote such as naloxone. Given her altered mental status and likely impaired ability to protect her airway, she will in all likelihood require invasive mechanical ventilation until the effect of the ingested substance wears off and she wakes up and ventilates adequately on her own. The above patient was placed on a ventilator set to deliver 100% oxygen at a tidal volume of 1.0 liter and rate of 20 breaths/minute. Two hours later his ABG showed: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.72 150 16 - (mmol/L) 21 The patient\\'s pH: Alkalemia Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is low. Therefore, the patient is hyperventilating and has a respiratory alkalosis. Keep in mind that the patient is not actually doing this herself. The hyperventilation is likely the result of inappropriate ventilator settings (ie the rate and/or tidal volume are too high). Metabolic acid-base status: At first glance, the low bicarbonate would suggest the patient has a metabolic acidosis. However, the change in bicarbonate is consistent with that seen in an acute process (~ 0.1 x the change in PaCO2 from normal) Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The high pH (alkalemia) in conjunction with the low PaCO2 tells us that the respiratory alkalosis is the primary process. There is no compensatory metabolic process. This would, therefore, be called an acute respiratory alkalosis. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 1.0 - (16 / 1.0) = 697 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 697 - 150 = 547 mm Hg Note: R becomes 1 when a patient is on FIO2 = 1.0 There is no longer any hypoventilation. The (A-a)DO2 is markedly elevated despite being on an FIO2 of 1.0, thereby telling us she has a lot of shunt. Remember, the hallmark of shunt is that the PaO2 does not improve or minimally improves on supplemental oxygen (the magnitude of the response depends on the shunt fraction). This could happen if she aspirated peri-intubation and now has a significant alveolar filling process causing shunt physiology. 8  4 Answers \\n Possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy The patient is hyperventilating as a result of inappropriate ventilator settings. Therefore, to correct the acid-base disturbance, her ventilator settings need to be adjusted such that she gets less minute ventilation (decrease the tidal volume). Case 2 A 65 year-old woman with COPD has an arterial blood gas performed while breathing ambient air as part of an evaluation for home oxygen therapy which reveals: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.35 63 51 - (mmol/L) 36 The patient\\'s pH: The pH is at the low end of the normal range. Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is high. Therefore, the patient is hypoventilating and has a respiratory acidosis. This could be due to low alveolar ventilation resulting from a large physiologic dead space due to her COPD.Metabolic acid-base status: The bicarbonate is well above the normal range, indicating there is a metabolic alkalosis. The presence of a metabolic alkalosis is confirmed by the increased bicarbonate. The change in bicarbonate is about 0.4 times the change in PaCO2 from normal, which strongly suggests this is a chronic respiratory process. Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The pH at the very low end of the normal range in conjunction with the high PaCO2 tells us that the respiratory acidosis is the primary process. There is a compensatory metabolic alkalosis and compensation is nearly complete since the pH at the time of presentation has come up to the lower limit of normal. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 0.21 - (63 / 0.8) = 71 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 71 - 51 = 20 mm Hg On presentation, hypoventilation is present and, therefore, playing a role in his hypoxemia. The (A-a)DO2 should be 15 (65/5 + 1) but is slightly higher, which tells us that she likely has VA/Q mismatch as an additional cause of hypoxemia. Possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy Her arterial blood showed that she had a chronic respiratory acidosis due to hypoventilation from her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis). This is reflective of severe disease and is difficult to reverse. The bulk of your medical therapy would be directed against treating her underlying COPD but it is unlikely that you will improve her disease control enough to eliminate the chronic hypoventilation. As was discussed earlier in the course most  4 Answers 9 \\nCOPD therapy is directed at symptom control and exacerbation prevention but does not fix the underlying disease (i.e., the emphysema) that is predisposing her to hypoventilation. To address her hypoxemia, she could be placed on long-term oxygen therapy. The same patient presents to the Emergency Department two weeks later with increasing cough and sputum production and worsening dyspnea. An arterial blood gas is drawn while she is breathing ambient air, which reveals: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.28 72 38 - (mmol/L) 37 The patient\\'s pH: Acidemia Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is high. Therefore, the patient is hypoventilating and has a respiratory acidosis. Importantly, she is hypoventilating to a greater extent than on the prior arterial blood gas. Metabolic acid-base status: The bicarbonate is elevated indicating there is a metabolic alkalosis. This is largely unchanged from her previous blood gas. Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The low pH (acidemia) in conjunction with the high PaCO2 tells us that the respiratory acidosis is the still primary process. There is a metabolic alkalosis and some element of compensation. It is important to note, however, that the PaCO2 is higher than on her previous visit and the pH is lower. This indicates that her acid-base disorder is no longer fully compensated. The increase in PaCO2 and the decline in pH from the previous values are consistent with a pattern referred to as an \"acute on chronic respiratory acidosis.\" The PaCO2 has risen from its previous baseline and, because this is an acute change, there has not been enough time for further renal compensation. As a result, the pH is lower than before. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 0.21- (72 / 0.8) = 60 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 60 - 38 = 22 mm Hg Hypoventilation accounts for some of the hypoxemia but because the (A-a)DO2 is elevated we know that there are areas of either shunt or low VA/Q.Possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy As was covered earlier in the course, this patient is having an exacerbation of her COPD.This has worsened her respiratory mechanics and decreased her alveolar ventilation, which, in turn, has led to an increase in his PaCO2. Because this is an acute change there has not been time for further renal compensation to mitigate the pH change. The appropriate therapy consists of aggressive treatment of her COPD exacerbation including systemic corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and supplemental oxygen. 10  4 Answers \\n Case 3 A 57 year-old man presents to the emergency department with two days of cough productive of thick, brown sputum, fevers, chills and increasing dyspnea. In the triage area, his SpO2 was 85%. A chest radiograph is performed and is shown below: An arterial blood gas is drawn while he is breathing ambient air, which reveals: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.49 32 - (mmol/L) 23 55 The patient\\'s pH: Alkalemia Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is low. Therefore, the patient is hyperventilating and has a respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acid-base status: The bicarbonate is within the normal range. The deviation from the typical normal value of 24 is approximately 0.1 x the change in PaCO2 from normal, indicating that this is an acute process and therefore no metabolic compensation is present. Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The high pH (alkalemia) in conjunction with the low PaCO2 tells that the respiratory alkalosis is the primary process (likely due to an increase in minute ventilation and subsequent increase in alveolar ventilation due to the hypoxemia). The small change in bicarbonate suggests this is an acute process and renal compensation has not occurred. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 0.21- (32 / 0.8) = 110 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 110 - 55 = 55 mm Hg Because the PaCO2 is low, the patient does not have hypoventilation. The large (A-a)DO2 of 55 mm Hg indicates the patient has either shunt or low VA/Q as the cause of his  4 Answers 11 \\n hypoxemia. Information about the response to supplemental oxygen has not been provided making it difficult to distinguish between shunt and low VA/Q, but the fact that the patient has a focal opacity on chest radiograph and a clinical history suspicious for pneumonia would lead you to expect that shunt is the primary cause of hypoxemia. Possible clinical explanation(s) and appropriate therapy The presence of productive cough, fever and dyspnea as well as a focal opacity on chest radiograph strongly suggests this patient has pneumonia. The patient should be placed on appropriate empiric antibiotic therapy and supplemental oxygen. If he shows signs of distress or inability to maintain the required work of breathing, he may require intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation Case 4 A 61 year-old man presents to the pulmonary clinic for evaluation of worsening dyspnea over an 8-month period. He denies fevers, weight loss or chest pain but notes a non-productive cough over the past several months. On exam, he has clubbing and fine bibasilar end-inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation. A chest radiograph is performed and reveals: An arterial blood gas is done in clinic and the results are as follows: pH PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 7.44 33 60 - (mmol/L) 21 The patient\\'s pH: Normal Respiratory acid-base status: The PaCO2 is low. Therefore, the patient is hyperventilating and has a respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic acid-base status: The bicarbonate is below the normal range and the patient has a metabolic acidosis. The deviation from the typical normal value of 24 is more than 0.2 x the change in PaCO2 12  4 Answers \\n from normal, indicating that this is chronic process and therefore metabolic compensation is present. Primary acid-base disorder and presence/absence of compensation: The pH on the high end of the normal range in conjunction with the low PaCO2 tells that the respiratory alkalosis is the primary process (likely due to an increase in minute ventilation and subsequent increase in alveolar ventilation due to the hypoxemia). The change in bicarbonate suggests this is a chronic process and renal compensation has occurred. Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference / Cause of hypoxemia: PAO2 = (PB - 47) x FIO2 - (PaCO2/R) = (760-47) x 0.21- (33 / 0.8) = 99 mm Hg (A-a)DO2 = PAO2 - PaO2 = 99 - 60 = 39 mm Hg Because the PaCO2 is low, the patient does not have hypoventilation. The large (A-a)DO2 of 39 mm Hg indicates the patient has either shunt or low VA/Q as the cause of his hypoxemia. Information about the response to supplemental oxygen has not been provided making it difficult to distinguish between shunt and low VA/Q in this case. Possible clinical explanation(s) This patient has chronic dyspnea (dyspnea present for months-years in duration). The presence of clubbing and end-inspiratory crackles on lung exam as well as a chest radiograph demonstrating reticular (i.e., interstitial) opacities in a bibasilar distribution would raise concern for the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. The most appropriate next steps in this patient\\'s management would include pulmonary function testing to characterize the functional defect and grade its severity and a high resolution chest CT scan to obtain more information about the abnormalities in the lung parenchyma.  4 Answers 13 \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 6: Shock Day: 10 Hour: 4 Exercise 1 Right and left heart catheterization can be used to obtain pressures throughout the cardiac circulation. This data can help us identify areas of dysfunction. On the diagram below, label each section with its normal pressure range. What do high or low pressures indicate? High pressures indicate overfilling. This can be from the inability of the heart to move blood forward (ie severe aortic stenosis obstructing flow, or a weakened ventricle). Low pressures indicate underfilling (ie from loss of volume or a decrease in venous return).  6-Answers 1 \\nCase 1 A 45 year-old patient presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, chills, and fever for 3 days. They describe dizziness and malaise for the past 12 hours. Past medical history includes diet-controlled type II diabetes and hypertension. Medications include Lisinopril 5mg daily. On physical exam: Vital signs: General: Cardiovascular: Afebrile, BP 80/50 mm Hg, HR 120 bpm, RR 20 per minute. Well-developed, ill appearing, flushed and diaphoretic. Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs or gallops. JVP 5 cm. 1+ radial and pedal pulses, 1+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema Clear to auscultation. Mildly distended and very tender to palpation at the right upper quadrant. Warm Mildly confused, oriented x 2 (name and place). Pulmonary: Abdominal: Extremities: Neuro: An ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment changes. A CXR shows no infiltrates. Labs include an elevated WBC to 20k with a left shift. Question 1 Based on your physical exam, what is the most likely type of shock? Do you expect the cardiac output to be low, normal, or high? Do you expect the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to be low, normal, or high? She is warm and flushed, and this suggests septic shock. Septic shock is associated with high cardiac output as the result of low SVR.Patients with cardiogenic shock and hemorrhagic shock have low cardiac output and they appear cold. 2  6-Answers \\nQuestion 2 Describe your approach to treatment of the hypotension. How will you treat the underlying cause of shock? The primary problem in septic shock is inappropriate vasodilatation and low SVR.Treatment of the hypotension centers on pharmacologic vasoconstriction with an intravenous alpha1-agonist such as norepinephrine (NE) or phenylephrine. Vasopressin (anti-diuretic hormone) can also be used to increase peripheral vascular resistance (PVR). IV fluids can be given to increase central volume and preload. Antibiotics to treat the infection should be given as soon as blood and urine cultures are obtained (the history suggests cholecystitis - a gallbladder infection). A pulmonary artery catheter is placed after the patient does not respond to IV fluids and low doses of IV norepinephrine and vasopressin. BP remains at 80/50 mm Hg and HR 120 bpm. RA pressure is 5 mm Hg, PA pressure 25/12 mm Hg, PCWP is 10 mm Hg, and the mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 78%. The thermodilution cardiac output is 8 L/min (4 L/min/m2). Question 3 Does the mixed venous oxygen saturation suggest a low, normal or high cardiac output? Calculate the SVR (normal SVR is 800-1200 dynes x sec x cm-5). The high mixed venous oxygen saturation (normal is 75%) suggests that arterial oxygen delivery exceeds the metabolic demands of the tissues, so cardiac output (CO) must be high. Put another way, by the Fick equation, CO = VO2 CaO2 - CvO2 where VO2 = oxygen consumption, CaO2 = arterial oxygen content, and CvO2 = venous oxygen content. The smaller the difference between the arterial and venous oxygen content, the higher the cardiac output. Thus, SVR is low, consistent with the diagnosis of septic shock. A 25 year-old patient presents with progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for several weeks. They have been using methamphetamines regularly for 6 months and describe shortness of breath with minimal activity, orthopnea, PND, anorexia, and lower extremity edema. On physical exam, an ECG shows sinus tachycardia with nonspecific T wave and ST-segment changes. A CXR shows pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. Labs include an elevated WBC to 15k. Question 1 Afebrile, BP 70/40 mm Hg, HR 140 bpm, RR 32 per minute. Ill appearing Tachycardic, regular rhythm. No murmurs. +S3 gallop. JVP 14 cm. Bibasilar rales in the lower half of the lungs. Mildly distended, soft, and nontender to palpation. Cold, mottled skin. Trace radial and pedal pulses. Confused, slightly agitated. Based on your physical exam, what is the most likely type of shock? Do you expect the S𝒗̅O2 and cardiac output to be low, normal, or high? Do you expect the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to be low, normal or high? The patient has signs and symptoms of heart failure, so cardiogenic shock is the most likely diagnosis. Cardiac output would therefore be low, and this is consistent with their cold extremities and mottled skin. A low cardiac output would be associated with a low SvO2 since peripheral tissues are able to extract a greater percentage of the delivered O2 with slower blood flow. Because of RAAS and SNS activity promoting peripheral vasoconstriction to raise blood pressure, the SVR is high. An urgent echocardiogram demonstrates a dilated left ventricle with EF 10%, mild to moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation, and a dilated and hypokinetic right ventricle. The patient is admitted to your ICU service. Question 2 What is the appropriate management for this very sick patient? The treatment here is very different from the patient with septic shock. Instead of adding drugs to increase SVR, the focus will be on increasing cardiac stroke volume by lowering afterload and/or increasing contractility. Due to the low blood pressure, the focus is to increase contractility (ie with dobutamine, an intravenous beta1-agonist). This is similar to the case of acute decompensated heart failure from Conference 4. You are on the general surgery team at Harborview. A 78 year-old man presents with abdominal pain and dizziness. He has a history of hypertension and heavy tobacco use. His blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg and heart rate is 100 bpm. On exam, he has dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, flat neck veins, normal heart sounds, and a large pulsatile, abdominal mass. A CT scan shows an abdominal aortic aneurysm and a large retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Question 1 Based on your physical exam, what is the most likely type of shock? Do you expect the S𝒗̅O2 and cardiac output to be low, normal, or high? Do you expect the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) to be low, normal or high? Discuss what you would expect to find on a right heart catheterization in this patient. He has intravascular volume loss related to rupture of the aortic aneurysm and hemorrhage. Thus, this is a case of hypovolemic shock. - The volume loss results in low preload and subsequently low cardiac output. Because CO is low, SvO2 will therefore also be low. SVR will be high as the RAAS and SNS try to support blood pressure. Right heart catheterization will show a low RA and PCW pressure. Draw a plot showing the relationship between blood flow and pressure in a typical organ system. Describe myogenic autoregulation and how it works. Recall that Q = ΔP/R. From this equation, we see that to keep flow constant, any change in pressure must be accompanied by a change in resistance. Myogenic autoregulation is the ability of nearly all organs to keep their blood flow constant despite changes in arterial pressure. The is accomplished by adjusting the tone (resistance) of the arterioles feeding that organ. For example, if arterial pressure increases, arteriole smooth muscle cells sense the increased transmural stretching and respond by vasoconstricting. The increase in pressure is therefore counterbalanced by the decrease in radius to keep flow at a constant speed. Likewise, if arterial pressure decreases, arteriole smooth muscle cells vasodilate to allow flow to stay constant. Note that this process only occurs within the autoregulatory range. Give examples of why blood flow to an organ would need to change. If arterial pressure remains constant, describe how blood flow can still change to meet an organ\\'s metabolic needs. Examples of changes in the organ distribution of blood flow: exercise leads to increased blood flow to the heart and active skeletal muscle studying for exams leads to increased cerebral blood flow food ingestion leads to increased splanchnic blood flow Blood flow to an organ can increase despite a constant arterial pressure. This occurs via metabolic autoregulation (arterioles change their diameter according to metabolic rate of the organ they supply) and by extrinsic factors (ie sympathetic nervous system stimulation). Because pressure is constant, we no longer rely on transmural stretch to stimulate a change in resistance (ie myogenic autoregulation). Question 3 During exercise in a healthy adult, if stroke volume increases by 30% and heart rate triples, by how much does cardiac output increase? What happens to systemic vascular resistance during exercise for this person? (Hint: Describe resistance as a function of cardiac output and arterial pressure) Recall that CO = SV x HR, where CO is cardiac output, SV is stroke volume, and HR is heart rate. From our first calculation, we found that Cardiac Output increases 4-fold. However, MAP would not normally increase 4-fold in a healthy exercising person. Therefore, SVR must decrease. Create a table of the class, mechanism and effects on systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and blood pressure of the following drugs: doxazosin, norepinephrine, amlodipine, and metoprolol. Doxazosin is an alpha blocker that reduces vascular tone and reduces SVR, leading to a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine blocks smooth muscle cell (SMC) surface membrane calcium channels and reduces calcium entry into SMCs, which leads to SMC relaxation reduces SVR to reduces blood pressure. Metoprolol predominantly blocks the alpha1-adrenergic receptor on myocardial cells, including the sinus node, leading to a fall in heart rate and contractility. This lowers cardiac output, which results in decreased blood pressure. SVR is not affected. Activation of alpha2-adrenergic receptors on SMCs results in vasodilation. Thus, drugs that block alpha2-adrenergic receptors lead to vasoconstriction. As a result, alpha2-adrenergic receptor blockers increase peripheral vascular resistance, and thus decrease flow in the extremities. For this reason, nonselective beta-blockers (blocking both alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors) are avoided in patients with peripheral vascular disease.\\nA healthy individual assumes an upright posture. How is their blood pressure maintained?\\nA patient with depression takes an overdose of amlodipine. Their blood pressure in the emergency room is 80/50 mm Hg. Why is their blood pressure so low? How would you increase their blood pressure? Blood pressure is low because excessive blockade of calcium channels on vascular smooth muscle cells leads to inappropriate relaxation (vasodilation). Intravenous (IV) fluids would increase central venous pressure, subsequently increasing cardiac stroke volume, cardiac output, and consequently blood pressure. However, the main problem is a low SVR. Infusion of IV calcium would increase serum calcium levels, allowing more calcium to enter vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby stimulating smooth muscle cell contraction, and thus improvement in blood pressure. The best emergent treatment would be infusion of an alpha1-adrenergic agonist (ie phenylephrine) to rapidly increase vascular smooth muscle cell contraction and SVR. Case 2 A patient is injured in a motor vehicle accident. They have ongoing blood loss and their blood pressure is 70/40 mm Hg at the scene. The patient is alert, lucid. Based on your understanding of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), how do you expect the heart rate and systemic vascular resistance to respond? Why is the blood pressure low despite these ANS effects? What happens to blood flow to the skin, gut, and kidneys? This is a case of hypovolemic shock leading to a marked fall in mean arterial pressure and consequently a marked reduction in arterial baroreceptor activity. There is a resultant increase in sympathetic activity and decrease in parasympathetic activity leading to peripheral vasoconstriction (arteriolar and venous through alpha1-adrenergic receptor stimulation), and increased heart rate and contractility (alpha1-adrenergic receptor stimulation and withdrawal of parasympathetic tone). So, heart rate and systemic vascular resistance increase. Despite these adaptations, blood pressure remains low because of ongoing blood loss and subsequent low cardiac output. The marked vasoconstriction results in reduced blood flow to the skin, gut, and kidneys.\\nA patient with a severe peanut allergy accidentally ingested peanuts at a party. They become lightheaded and develop altered mental status. Blood pressure is 55/30 mm Hg and heart rate is 150 bpm. Using the relationship between blood flow and pressure in a cerebral artery, explain why blood flow to the brain cannot be maintained at this level of blood pressure. You arrive on the scene first. What specific drug would you administer? Because blood pressure the autoregulatory range, vascular resistance no longer adjusts to pressure. Recall that: Q = ΔP/R. Thus, cerebral blood flow is reduced. The best acute treatment would be administration of an alpha1-adrenergic agonist to rapidly increase vascular smooth muscle cell contraction, which increases SVR, subsequently increasing blood pressure. Patients with a history of anaphylaxis carry an EpiPen (epinephrine) for this reason. Case 4 the including in compliance of An 85 year-old patient with longstanding hypertension, on multiple medications, comes to see you for the first time. Their blood pressure is 160/60 mm Hg and the rest of the physical exam does not suggest aortic regurgitation. Why is the pulse pressure so high? The wide pulse pressure is caused by a decrease large the aorta. Vascular arteries compliance can be estimated as ΔV/ΔP. For the same stroke volume, there will be a greater rise in pressure in a less compliant vessel. This contributes to the elevation in systolic blood pressure. In addition, recoil of large arteries during diastole contribute to diastolic blood pressure. The less compliant arteries in older patients thus, diastolic blood pressure is lower.\\nCase 5 A patient with a history of sickle cell disease and a recent viral upper respiratory infection presents to the ED with abdominal pain. Blood pressure is 130/85 mm Hg. They are confused, and their abdomen is tender. Using the Poiseuille equation, how might you explain the decrease in blood flow to the brain and small bowel that is causing these symptoms? By the Poiseuille equation, flow is inversely related to viscosity (𝜂): Q = ΔP 𝜋r4 8𝜂L . Thus, an increase in viscosity will reduce flow. In sickle cell disease, blood has a higher viscosity then normal blood at the same hemoglobin level (1.5-fold), and deoxygenated sickle blood has an even higher viscosity than normal blood (10-fold). The increased viscosity is the result of polymerization of hemoglobin S, the predominant hemoglobin in patients with sickle cell disease. The abnormal blood viscosity leads to reduced tissue blood flow and thus the hypoxia seen in acute sickle cell crises. One of the key features of Step 1 of the USMLE is that many of the questions involve working through clinical vignettes of undifferentiated patients. In other words, starting out the question, you have no idea what the patient\\'s underlying disease is and will need to figure that out in order to answer the question that follows. This will also be an important skill on the final exam in our course. The following case vignettes have been created to help you build experience recognizing a patient\\'s disease process from a clinical description. Each case is presented as an unknown and includes clinical information and some data to interpret. The disease process is then given on the following page with a short explanation of what aspects of the clinical presentation should have led you to that conclusion. Case 1 A 61 year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia presents for evaluation of worsening cough. He reports having a morning cough productive of small amounts of clear sputum for several years, with an increase in cough frequency and dyspnea in the last two days. He thinks his sputum is thicker and it is now green in color. He denies fevers, chills, or chest pain and is not aware of any sick contacts. He has a 50 pack-year smoking history, and quit smoking five years ago. The patient is breathing 24 times a minute and has an oxygen saturation of 90% on ambient air; he is afebrile. His cardiac exam is normal and pulmonary exam reveals diminished breath sounds and a prolonged expiratory phase. The results of spirometry from a prior clinic visit and a current chest radiograph are shown below. Diagnosis: COPD Exacerbation The patient has a significant smoking history, chronic bronchitis based on his symptoms of daily sputum production, and evidence of obstruction (decreased FEV1/FVC) on spirometry. These findings support a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient\\'s prolonged expiratory phase fits with an obstructive process such as asthma or COPD.The notable findings on the chest radiograph are large lung volumes and flattened hemidiaphragms. The patient is describing a change in sputum color and consistency, worsening cough, and increased dyspnea, which are cardinal symptoms of a COPD exacerbation. The lack of fever, chest examination without crackles, and absence of alveolar opacities on chest radiograph all make pneumonia less likely. The absence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette, pleural effusions, and alveolar opacities on chest radiograph make a diagnosis of congestive heart failure less likely. \\nCase 2 A 73 year old man with COPD and coronary artery disease presents to pulmonary clinic with a two months history of a cough and weight loss. He describes his cough as intermittently productive of blood-tinged sputum. His usual inhalers have not helped with his cough. He says he has lost 25 pounds over the last two months and feels that he is much weaker than he was three months ago. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 50 years. On exam, he is normotensive and slightly tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 97% on ambient air. He has cachexia with temporal wasting. The cardiac exam is normal with flat neck veins and the respiratory exam reveals a prolonged expiratory phase with both inspiratory and expiratory wheezing. There is no lower extremity edema or clubbing. His laboratory work-up including complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis and ECG are normal. A chest radiograph is shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Possible Lung Cancer The combination of weight loss and hemoptysis are quite concerning for malignancy or a chronic infection such as tuberculosis. His significant smoking history places lung cancer at the top of the list. The normal cardiac exam, flat neck veins, and lack of peripheral edema make a cardiovascular etiology less likely. His laboratory work-up is unremarkable, however the chest radiograph reveals a large mass in the right middle lobe. The mass has ill-defined borders and some evidence of spiculation, which raises concern for a malignancy. However, a chronic infection could be possibility. Lung abscess is less likely a consideration given that there is no cavitation in this lesion. The next most appropriate step given the concern for malignancy would be a CT scan and, based on the results of that study, biopsy would likely be indicated.\\nCase 3 A 64 year-old man with coronary artery disease and history of myocardial infarction three years prior presents to clinic for evaluation of dry cough and dyspnea on exertion. He believes his symptoms began two years ago and that they have been slowly progressive. He has had no fevers, night sweats, or changes in weight. He works as a librarian and has to take frequent breaks when walking around to re-shelve books. He endorses an 18 pack-year smoking history and quit smoking thirty years ago. He lives at home with his wife and two dogs. He has no known exposures at work and has not had any other occupations. Physical examination reveals coarse crackles in both lower lungs and digital clubbing; there is no peripheral edema. The joint examination is normal. Laboratory testing, including evaluation for autoimmune disease, are normal. The results of pulmonary function testing and chest radiography are shown below. Predicted Measured % Predicted 4.04 3.18 0.79 6.23 2.13 3.22 29.3 2.45 2.26 0.92 3.74 1.03 1.78 10.0 61 71 N/A 60 48 55 34 Parameter FVC (liters) FEV1 (liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (liters) RV (liters) FRC (liters) DLCO (mL/min/mm Hg) \\nDiagnosis: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis This patient has several features of diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD). He endorses progressive symptoms of dyspnea over a long time period as well as non-productive cough without other systemic symptoms and has crackles as well as clubbing on examination. Pulmonary function testing shows no obstruction (FEV1/FVC is high, not low) and evidence of restriction, defined by a low TLC.All lung volumes are decreased and a low DLCO suggests that the restrictive pathophysiology is due to a parenchymal process. The patient\\'s chest radiograph demonstrates low lung volumes and reticular opacities that are more prominent in the bases and in the periphery. While the differential diagnosis for DPLD is broad, this patient does not have features to suggest diseases such as asbestosis (no occupational history to support asbestos exposure), connective tissue disease (normal joint exam, negative markers for autoimmune disease), or hypersensitivity pneumonitis (no specific exposures mentioned). If these and other DPLD\\'s are ruled out, the patient is likely to have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A diagnosis of IPF would also fit with the patient\\'s gender, age, and radiographic findings. The patient also has risk factors for congestive heart failure (coronary artery disease, smoking history, prior MI) and crackles on exam could suggest pulmonary edema. Heart failure is less likely without peripheral edema on exam and without an enlarged cardiac silhouette or pleural effusions on imaging. \\nCase 4 A 67 year-old Vietnamese woman with hypertension is brought in to the Emergency Department by her family with several weeks of fevers, productive cough, and weight loss. She endorses intermittent night sweats as well as occasional hemoptysis. She is unsure of how much weight she has lost but her family states that they had to buy her new pants because her old ones no longer fit her. She emigrated to the US 20 years ago and has not been back to Vietnam since. She is a never smoker and does not drink alcohol or use any illicit narcotics. On exam she is febrile to 38.5°C and has an oxygen saturation of 93% on ambient air. She is diaphoretic with normal cardiac and lymph node exams. There are rhonchi in the right upper lung zones, and she has no lower extremity edema or clubbing. Initial laboratory work-up reveals sodium of 132 mEq/L, a normal urinalysis and creatinine, and a hematocrit of 31%. Chest radiograph is shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Tuberculosis The patient\\'s history of fevers, night sweats and weight loss is highly suggestive of indolent infection or malignancy. The differential diagnosis includes both tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacteria, other pneumonias with prolonged courses (such as fungal), malignancies such as lymphoma or lung cancer, or a vasculitis, among other things. Vietnam is a highly endemic area for tuberculosis, and the presentation of weight loss, fevers, night sweats and fevers would be consistent with this. The opacity in the right upper lobe, which corresponds to the area of abnormality seen on physical exam, would also be consistent with reactivation tuberculosis. There are no masses or significant lymphadenopathy, and her renal function and urinalysis are normal, all of which make malignancy and vasculitis much less likely. \\nCase 5 A 52 year-old woman presents for evaluation of cough. She reports dyspnea that has been progressive over the last year. She had attributed this to getting older, but she is now short of breath walking one city block. She began having a non- productive cough one month ago. She is a lifelong nonsmoker, but reports secondhand smoke exposure from her husband. She and her husband own a pet store and have dogs, cats, and cockatiels at home. On examination, you note faint crackles in bilateral upper lung zones. The results of pulmonary function testing are shown below.

The patient has no obstruction (FEV1/FVC is normal), but all lung volumes are reduced and there is a low TLC, diagnostic of restriction. The severe reduction in DLCO suggests a parenchymal etiology to restriction. The patient\\'s longstanding exposure to bird antigens raises concern for hypersensitivity pneumonitis and pathology demonstrates loosely formed granulomas, which can be seen in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Other granulomatous lung diseases include tuberculosis (the granulomas in this disease are caseating, or necrotizing) and sarcoidosis (these granulomas are nearly always non-caseating, or non-necrotizing). \\nCase 6 A 28 year-old woman is seen in the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She was running to catch the bus to work when she became dizzy and collapsed. She denies chest pain or dyspnea, but does admit to dyspnea on exertion in the last few years. She attributes this to weight gain and a more sedentary lifestyle. On examination, you note elevated jugular venous pressure, a loud pulmonic component of S2, and a holosystolic murmur best heard along the left lower sternal border that increases with inspiration. Pulmonary examination is normal and there is no clubbing. An electrocardiogram shows sinus tachycardia at 104 beats per minute with right axis deviation and a tall P wave in lead II.A chest radiograph is obtained and shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Pulmonary Hypertension This patient likely has pulmonary arterial hypertension. The case describes classic features of this disease including exertional syncope (a symptom seen in severe forms of the disease), typical findings on cardiac examination (loud P2, RV heave, murmur of tricuspid regurgitation), and electrocardiographic findings of right axis deviation and right atrial enlargement, as suggested by the tall P wave in lead II.The PA chest radiograph demonstrates hilar fullness, which could be due to enlargement of the pulmonary arteries or due to lymphadenopathy, but the lateral film demonstrates an enlarged right ventricle given the absence of the retrosternal air space, suggesting that pulmonary hypertension is more likely. The expected finding on pulmonary function testing is normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a decreased DLCO, reflecting decreased surface area for gas exchange in the vascular bed due to pruning of the pulmonary vasculature that occurs in this disease. \\nCase 7 A 67 year-old man with a history of diabetes and alcohol abuse presents to the Emergency Department with 3 days of fevers, cough and shortness of breath. He describes the cough as productive of yellow-green sputum. He also endorses right-sided chest pain that is not exacerbated by deep breathing or exercise, as well as a loss of appetite. He denies hemoptysis, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea. He smokes a half-pack of cigarettes daily and drinks a six-pack of beer nightly. He lives in Anacortes, WA, has not traveled outside of the US, and cannot remember ever having a TB skin test. On exam, his temperature is 38.6 °C, heart rate 107 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24 per minute, blood pressure 134/76 mm Hg, and O2 saturation 91% on air. He is diaphoretic and appears unwell. He is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and flat neck veins and has right-sided rhonchi in the mid lung zone. There is no lower extremity edema. Laboratory work-up is significant for WBC of 16,000 cells/uL with 84% neutrophils. ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Chest radiograph is below. \\nDiagnosis: Community-Acquired Pneumonia The patient comes in from home with relatively acute (a few days) onset fever, productive cough and dyspnea. The fever and productive cough point towards an infectious etiology. His exam is consistent with a focal right-sided abnormality and steers us away from congestive heart failure, as do the flat neck veins and no lower extremity edema. His laboratory work-up reveals a leukocytosis with neutrophilia, also consistent with an acute infection. Given these clinical features, the focal alveolar opacity in the right mid-lung supports a diagnosis of pneumonia, likely due to aspiration (risk factor of alcohol abuse) versus community acquired pneumonia. Tuberculosis is a consideration with opacities in the upper lung zone but is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms seen in this case. TB more commonly presents with subacute symptoms of dyspnea, fevers, night sweats, and weight loss. It would be important to document resolution of symptoms and radiographic opacity in this patient, however, as failure of those things to resolve would suggest you need to consider an alternative etiology. TB is often diagnosed initially as pneumonia, only to not resolve with antibiotic therapy. \\nCase 7 A 74 year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease and hypertension presents to clinic with three months of exertional dyspnea and a dry cough. He first noticed becoming short of breath while walking with his friends and it has now progressed to the point where he cannot keep up with them. He denies any chest pain, fevers or weight loss. He worked in a foundry for much of his adult life and smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 50 years. He has never traveled outside of the United States and has a dog and two cats at home. On exam his oxygen saturation is 87% on ambient air. He has a normal cardiac exam with flat neck veins, a prolonged expiratory phase with mild wheezing, and no lower extremity edema. PFTs and chest radiograph are shown below: Measured % Predicted Parameter Predicted FVC (liters) FEV1 (liters) FEV1/FVC TLC DLCO 4.48 3.67 0.81 6.45 31.64 2.66 1.64 0.62 4.23 9.26 59 45 N/A 65 29 \\nDiagnosis: Silicosis The patient presents with several months of a dry cough and progressive exertional dyspnea. This has a large differential that including heart failure, indolent infections, diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), malignancy, and/or airflow obstruction, among other things. Malignancy or an infectious etiology are less likely as the patient has not had any fevers or weight loss, though the patient\\'s age and tobacco history are risk factors for lung cancer. The patient\\'s significant smoking history also puts him at risk for COPD, and airflow obstruction is confirmed on spirometry by a low FEV1/FVC.The TLC is also reduced, indicating that this patient has a mixed obstructive and restrictive ventilatory disorder. His exam is consistent with COPD (prolonged expiratory phase and wheezing) but the chest radiograph reveals bilateral upper lobe opacities as well as reticular opacities that would not be expected were this COPD alone. When viewed in conjunction with long history of working in a foundry, the clinical presentation and imaging findings raise concern for silicosis. \\nCase 8 A 58 year-old man with hypertension and diabetes presents to the Emergency Room with several months of intermittent chest pain and shortness of breath. He endorses exertional, substernal chest pain that he describes as a dull pressure associated with hand numbness bilaterally. He notices shortness of breath while walking up hills or when he lies down at night, and has recently worsened to the point that has to prop himself up with three pillows in order to sleep. He denies any fevers, night sweats, cough or weight loss. His exam reveals an oxygen saturation of 98%, an S3 with a laterally displaced PMI, elevated neck veins, and rales in the bases of both lung fields. He also has symmetric lower extremity edema without clubbing. Laboratory work-up reveals sodium of 128 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, an elevated B-natriuretic peptide and normal cardiac enzymes. ECG and chest radiograph are shown below: \\n Diagnosis: Ischemic cardiomyopathy The differential diagnosis for exertional dyspnea is broad and includes entities such as cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, anemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Chest pain also has a broad differential including angina, acute coronary syndrome, pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection and a variety of other processes. Many of the things on this list, however, such as aortic dissection or pneumothorax, would be associated more with acute onset of chest pain rather than chest pain that occurred with exertion. The fact that he has symptoms over several months makes an acute process such as bacterial pneumonia, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolus or a pneumothorax unlikely in this case. The description of 3-pillow orthopnea, elevated JVP, and symmetric lower extremity are suggestive of congestive heart failure. The chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette suggestive of CHF.Hyponatremia can be seen in states of fluid overload and an elevated creatinine indicates poor renal perfusion. An elevated BNP can be seen in congestive heart failure from atrial stretch while normal cardiac enzymes make acute coronary syndrome less likely. The ECG shows old ischemic changes inferiorly (Q waves in II, III, and aVF), making a diagnosis of ischemic cardiomyopathy most likely. \\nCase 9 A 35 year-old woman with asthma is seen in clinic for fever and joint aches. She reports one week of subjective fevers as well as fatigue and pain in her knees and ankles. Yesterday, she noticed tender, red \"bumps\" on her shins. She denies cough, chest pain, diarrhea, or any sick contacts. On examination, temperature is 38.4°C and oxygen saturation is normal. Cardiopulmonary examination is normal. A complete joint examination reveals no joint swelling, erythema, or warmth and no pain with passive motion. Findings on skin examination are shown below; there are tender, erythematous, and warm nodules on the anterior surfaces of both legs (shown below). A chest radiograph is obtained and shown below: \\n Diagnosis: Sarcoidosis (Lofgren\\'s Syndrome) The findings in this case are suggestive of a diagnosis of Lofgren\\'s syndrome, an acute form of sarcoidosis. The patient presents with fever, arthralgias, and skin lesions that are suggestive of erythema nodosum. The chest radiograph reveals bilateral hilar fullness as well as fullness in the right paratracheal region suggestive of lymphadenopathy. The triad of hilar lymphadenopathy, arthralgias, and erythema nodosum is seen in Lofgren\\'s syndrome. Fever is also common and the disease has a good prognosis, with complete resolution in nearly all patients within two years. Another consideration in patients with hilar fullness is enlargement of the pulmonary arteries. Features arguing again pulmonary hypertension are the presence of fever and the absence of typical features on the cardiac exam (loud P2 component of S2, holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border that increases with inspiration, right ventricular heave). \\nCase 10 A 24 year-old graduate student presents for evaluation of an intermittent cough. She is healthy aside from seasonal allergies and eczema and is a nonsmoker. She reports several episodes of dry cough and dyspnea in the last three years. She believes that her symptoms are worse during the winter and also in the spring when her allergies are also bothersome. Her roommate has recently taken in a stray cat and she has had more nocturnal cough since that time. Physical examination and chest radiograph are normal. Results of spirometry are shown below: Parameter Predicted Measured % Predicted 2.83 2.19 0.77 87 83 FVC (liters) FEV1 (liters) FEV1/FVC 3.25 2.63 0.80 \\nDiagnosis: Asthma This patient is describing symptoms suggestive of asthma. Not all patients with asthma have wheezing as a primary symptom and patients may present with cough alone. Factors supporting asthma include a history of atopy, the intermittent nature of symptoms, and triggers including allergies and pets. Worsening symptoms in the winter may be due to exposure to cold air or due to the increased prevalence of viral upper respiratory infections. Spirometry shows no evidence of obstruction (FEV1/FVC is normal) and FEV1 and FVC are also normal (>80%). However, physical examination and spirometry may be normal if patients present between episodes when they are asymptomatic, as in this case. You would still be highly suspicious of the diagnosis of asthma based on the history provided. \\nCase 11 A 22 year-old woman presents to Urgent Care clinic complaining of increased cough. She reports a history of frequent sinopulmonary infections as a child and notes that she now has a daily cough productive of large amounts of thick yellow sputum. In the last two days, her cough frequency has increased, the sputum is green in color and she has had low-grade fever and fatigue. Review of systems is notable for chronic loose stools. On physical examination, she has a BMI of 18 kg/m2 and appears fatigued. She is afebrile with an oxygen saturation of 92% on ambient air. Pulmonary examination reveals rhonchi in all lung fields, most prominent in the lung apices and scattered wheezes. Cardiac and abdominal exams are normal. Her nail findings and a slice from a CT of her chest are shown below. \\nDiagnosis: Cystic Fibrosis Exacerbation This underweight patient has a chronic cough productive of large amounts of sputum, a history of sinopulmonary infections as a child, chronic diarrhea (suggestive of malabsorption in her gut), and digital clubbing on examination, all findings that suggest a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The chest CT demonstrates bronchiectasis (permanent irreversible dilation of the airways), which is seen in cystic fibrosis as a consequence of impaired airway drainage due to ciliary dysfunction and chronic airway inflammation. The patient\\'s more acute symptoms of low-grade fever, increased cough with a change in sputum color, and fatigue suggest that she is having a cystic fibrosis exacerbation. While chronic productive cough can be seen in chronic bronchitis, this diagnosis would be highly unusual in a patient this age and you would not expect to see bronchiectasis on chest imaging. Asthma could be considered given the patient\\'s age and wheezing on examination, but asthma is not associated with bronchiectasis or chronic cough productive of copious amounts of sputum. Further, asthma and chronic bronchitis are not associated with digital clubbing. Two important items to remember regarding some findings in this patient: (cid:65) Clubbing is not specific for CF.It can be seen in chronic suppurative processes (bronchiectasis, TB), diseases associated with chronic hypoxemia (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, arteriovenous malformations) and malignancy. It is not a feature of COPD so if you see this develop in a patient with COPD, you need to consider the possibility of a new lung cancer. (cid:65) Wheezing, although often present in COPD and asthma, can be seen in other situations. The presence of wheezing means there is airflow obstruction and that airflow obstruction can result from asthma, COPD, a mass occluding an airway, peribronchial cuffing (edema fluid around the airways that narrows their diameter) in pulmonary edema and some other entities. \\nCase 12 A 62 year-old man develops right-sided chest pain and dyspnea two days following a left total hip replacement for osteoarthritis. The pain is worse with movement and deep inspiration but he has no cough, fever or hemoptysis. He is a lifelong non-smoker. On examination, he is afebrile with a heart rate 108 beats per minute, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 88% on ambient air. He appears anxious. On cardiac exam, there is no jugular venous distension, the point of maximal impulse is not displaced and his heart rate is fast with a regular rhythm and no murmurs. The lungs are clear to auscultation and there is 1+ edema of the left leg extending to the knee. An electrocardiogram and chest radiograph are obtained and shown below: \\n Diagnosis: Pulmonary Embolism The patient has the acute onset of dyspnea and chest pain. This should prompt consideration of entities such as myocardial infarction, spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumonia, pleural effusion and pulmonary embolism. The key historical clue in this case is that the patient had recent hip arthroplasty (associated with vascular/intimal injury) and immobility while recovering from surgery (stasis). These risk factors - two of three factors in Virchow\\'s triad of venous thromboembolism - would raise pulmonary embolus (PE) to the top of the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis of PE is further supported by the patient\\'s unilateral leg swelling, as the majority of PEs arise from the deep veins of the lower extremities. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia, a right bundle branch block, and T wave inversions in leads V1-V3, III, and aVF, nonspecific findings that can be seen in PE.Sinus tachycardia is the most common ECG finding in PE.The chest radiograph is largely unrevealing as it shows no focal opacities, normal heart size, and no effusions. A normal chest radiograph, in fact, is a common finding on plain chest radiography in PE.The right-sided and pleuritic character of the chest pain make myocardial infarction less likely, while pneumonia is unlikely given the absence of fever, cough, or parenchymal abnormalities on chest radiograph. Pneumothorax is also ruled out by the findings (or lack thereof) on chest radiography. \\nCase 13 A 2 year-old boy is brought into clinic by his mother in early December for evaluation of a barking cough. His mother reports that he developed a runny nose and low-grade fever five days ago that have since resolved, but he\\'s had a cough and hoarse voice for two days. He has been irritable, but has not had other symptoms. He was born at term, has been meeting his developmental milestones and is up-to-date on his vaccinations. On examination, he is afebrile and appears well. There is no pharyngeal erythema or drooling and no rashes. You note a high-pitched noise during the inspiratory phase of respiration but the lungs are otherwise clear to auscultation. A plain radiograph of the neck is obtained and is shown below: \\nDiagnosis: Laryngotracheobronchitis (Croup) The development of a barking cough in a young child following an upper respiratory infection suggests croup, or laryngotracheobronchitis. Croup is commonly seen in the winter months, as the condition typically results from viral infection (Respiratory Syncitial Virus and Parainfluenza are the most common causes). The hoarse voice and stridor noted in this case are both related to subglottic edema, a common feature of this disease. The radiograph shows what is referred to as a \"Steeple Sign.\" The inverted V appearance of the upper airway is suggestive of subglottic edema. Even had you not obtained this radiograph, there is enough evidence in the case to fit with a diagnosis of croup. Cough may also be seen in children with bronchiolitis, but this condition occurs in younger patients and is classically associated with wheezing rather than stridor. Epiglottitis should also be considered when a child presents with stridor but epiglottitis patients , generally appear more toxic with anxiety, fever, a muffled (rather than hoarse) voice, and drooling. Epiglottitis has also declined in frequency as a result of vaccination programs. \\nCase 14 Six days following repair of a femur fracture, a 73 year-old woman is drowsier than in previous days and is now requiring supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula. She reports pain at her hip, a productive cough and lethargy, but denies chest pain, wheezing, nausea, vomiting, urinary symptoms, or chills. Her vital signs include a temperature 101.2°F, heart rate 95 beats per minute, blood pressure 113/57 mm Hg, respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on 4 L/min oxygen by nasal cannula. On auscultation, she has decreased breath sounds at the left base. There is no edema and the hip wound shows no evidence of fluctuance or erythema. A chest radiograph is obtained and is shown below. Her laboratory studies reveal a WBC 13 x 103 cells/ul, Hb 12.5 g/dL and creatinine 0.9 mg/dL.\\nDiagnosis: Nosocomial Pneumonia The findings of cough, fever, and hypoxemia are highly suggestive of a diagnosis of pneumonia and the diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating the left lower lung zone opacity on chest radiograph. The presence of leukocytosis on her laboratory studies also fits with the presence of infection. If the patient was intubated, many practitioners would confirm the diagnosis by performing bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain an alveolar fluid sample for culture.. Because she has been in the hospital for more than 5 days, she is at risk for gram negative organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as those that are resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat pneumonia (e.g., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, MRSA). Treatment should include antibiotics that cover the spectrum of hospital-acquired organisms and supplemental oxygen. In addition to hospitalized patients, patients who have frequent contact with medical care such as hemodialysis centers, nursing homes, wound care clinics and patients who are immunocompromised or receiving chemotherapy are also at risk for developing infections due to health care- associated organisms and would be treated similarly if they developed pneumonia. Other diagnostic considerations for this patient include other health care- associated infections such as a urinary tract infection or pressure ulcer, as well as post-operative complications such as coronary artery disease or stroke. Venous thromboembolism should always be considered in post-operative patients with dyspnea, particularly following orthopedic procedures, but that diagnosis is not typically associated with such high fevers and would not be expected to cause the parenchymal abnormalities on this radiograph. \\nCase 15 During a routine, annual examination, a 62 year old man with hypertension and peripheral vascular disease reports no change in his health, but his wife notes that he falls asleep easily while watching TV after dinner despite a full night of sleep and an afternoon nap and adds that she has seen him stop breathing during sleep. He attributes the napping to the fact that he is now retired but endorses fatigue and a sore throat when he wakes up on many mornings. He has no shortness of breath, chest pain, cough, wheeze, weight gain, edema, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. On physical examination, his heart rate is 75 beats per minute, blood pressure 142/85 mm Hg, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation 96% on ambient air. He is obese with a BMI of 36 kg/m2. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations are normal. He is referred for overnight polysomnography and a portion of the study is shown below. \\nDiagnosis: Obstructive Sleep Apnea The most noteworthy aspect of his presentation is the presence of \"excessive daytime somnolence.\" This can be caused by many things, but several other features of his presentation suggest that this is due to obstructive sleep apnea including the fact that he has non-restorative sleep (he is still fatigued when he wakes up), has witnessed pauses in his breathing during sleep, and has a sore throat when he wakes up (due to all of the turbulent airflow in his upper airway during sleep). He also has several medical problems, including hypertension and peripheral vascular disease, for which patients with untreated obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is confirmed with overnight polysomnography, which allows quantification of the number of apneas (absence of airflow) and hypopneas (decreased airflow) per hour and determination of whether apneas are due to upper airway obstructions or are centrally (i.e., neurally) mediated. This patient\\'s polysomnogram demonstrates periods where there is decreased nasal/oral airflow, but continued thoracic and abdominal movement. This is the key factor in distinguishing obstructive (thoracic and abdominal movement during apnea) from central (absence of thoracic and abdominal movement) sleep apnea. It is also important to note that the periods of decreased airflow are accompanied by decreases in his oxygen saturation. First line treatment would include use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. \\n CPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 2: Answers to How We Handle CO2 And Move Air Cases Day: 19 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 26 year-old man develops progressive shortness of breath over four days with associated fever and chills. He finally decides to see a doctor and presents to the Emergency Department. His initial exam reveals a young man in moderate respiratory distress with heart rate 112 beats/minute, blood pressure 98/56 mm Hg and respiratory rate 30 breaths/minute. The triage nurse checks pulse oximetry and finds his hemoglobin- oxygen saturation (SpO2) to be 82%. She also obtains an arterial blood gas sample with the following results: Parameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 53 mm Hg 38 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg She places him on supplemental oxygen to try to normalize his SpO2. Despite this therapy, the patient appears more and more fatigued. The physician evaluating him in the ED decides he should be intubated and supported on invasive mechanical ventilation. He asks the respiratory therapist to set up the ventilator with the following settings: Parameter FIO2 Setting 1.0 1000 mL Tidal volume (VT) Respiratory rate (f) 1. What is the patient\\'s minute ventilation (VE) while on mechanical ventilation? V\" = f x VT = 10 breaths/min x 1000 mL/breath = 10000 mL/min or 10 L/min Minute ventilation is the product of the respiratory rate and the tidal volume. We can therefore calculate minute ventilation as follows: 10 breaths / minute One important note: The terminology for respiratory rate and ventilation needs to be used carefully. For example, a patient with a fast respiratory rate (as the patient has in this case) is tachypneic but you cannot say anything about ventilation unless you also know the PaCO2 (i.e., unless you know the alveolar ventilation). Patients can have a very rapid shallow breathing pattern where the term shallow refers to the fact that they are taking very small tidal volumes. Even though they are tachypneic, their tidal volumes might be low enough that they are actually hypoventilating (defined as having an elevated PaCO2). A repeat arterial blood gas is performed while he is on these ventilator settings and reveals: CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 1 \\nParameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 125 mm Hg 58 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg Case 1 (continued) 2. Why has the patient\\'s PaCO2 risen? The PaCO2 has risen from 38 mm Hg to 53 mm Hg (he is now being hypoventilated). This tells us that when the ventilator settings were chosen, the minute ventilation was set inappropriately low. As a result, his alveolar ventilation was too low relative to his CO2 production and this led to a rise in his PaCO2. To see why this is the case, recall that the PaCO2 is determined by the balance between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation. To further understand this concept, we can use the analogy of a bathtub. The level of water in the bathtub represents the alveolar PACO2, which we take to be the same as the PaCO2. The level of water in the tub is determined by how much is brought into the tub by the faucet and how much is removed via the drain. For the lung, the faucet represents the amount of CO2 produced in the tissues and delivered to the lungs by the cardiac output while the drain represents the alveolar ventilation removing the CO2 from the lungs. 2 Considering this analogy, we can see that if the level of alveolar ventilation goes down in the face of constant CO2 production (i.e., the drain is not letting as much out while the faucet keeps delivering the same amount) then the PACO2 and PaCO2 increase (i.e., the water level goes up). In Question 1, we calculated his minute ventilation. How do we get from that value to his alveolar ventilation? You will recall that minute ventilation is comprised of the dead space ventilation and the alveolar ventilation: \\tV\"=\\tV#+V$ Let\\'s assume for now that his dead space ventilation has not changed at all. If his minute ventilation was set on the ventilator at a level lower than what he was doing on his own prior to intubation, this means that alveolar ventilation has to decrease. As noted above, a decrease in alveolar ventilation in the face of constant CO2 production leads to a rise in the PaCO2. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\nCase 1 (continued) The patient is transferred up to the ICU.The critical care physician caring for him is concerned that the patient\\'s tidal volumes are too high so she adjusts the ventilator. The new settings are: Parameter FIO2 Tidal volume (VT) Respiratory rate (f) Setting 0.9 500 mL 20 breaths / minute A repeat arterial blood gas reveals: Parameter PaO2 PaCO2 Result 85 mm Hg 69 mm Hg Normal Range 85-100 mm Hg 38-42 mm Hg 3. What is the patient\\'s minute ventilation now? Why has the PaCO2 increased further compared to when he was on the prior ventilator settings? Based on the new ventilator settings, we can recalculate the minute ventilation: V\" = f x VT = 20 breaths/min x 500 mL/breath = 10000 mL/min or 10 L/min We can see that the patient\\'s minute ventilation has not changed yet his PaCO2 has risen to 69 mm Hg. To see why this happened, we can go back to the relationship described above: V\"=\\tV#+V$ If we assume that CO2 production has not changed, the fact that the PaCO2 rose tells us that alveolar ventilation must have gone down. If minute ventilation is unchanged with the new ventilator settings, then the only way this can happen is if dead space ventilation increased. More specifically, the dead space fraction (VD/VT) has increased. To understand how this happened, we can break down the ventilator settings in a systematic fashion. Let\\'s assume that the dead space fraction (VD/VT) on our initial ventilator settings is 25% (in normal spontaneously breathing individuals, it is usually between 25 and 35%). As a result, the deadspace volume is 250 mL and we get the following breakdown of volumes and ventilation. VD (ml) 250 VA (ml) 750 VDVT Rate VE\\t (ml/min) 10000 __̇D (ml/min) 2500 VA (ml/min) 7500 0.25 10 Time 1 VT\\t (ml) 1000 We can repeat this now using the new ventilator settings. Recall that the volume of the anatomic dead space is largely fixed. This means that when you decrease the tidal volume to 500 mL, 250 mL of this volume must still go to clear the anatomic dead space, leaving only 250 mL for the alveolar volume. Revisiting the breakdown of volume and ventilation, we get the following: CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 3 \\nCase 1 (continued) Time 1 2 VT\\t (ml) 1000 500 VD (ml) VA (ml) VDVT Rate VE\\t (ml/min) VD (ml/min) VA (ml/min) 250 250 750 250 0.25 0.50 10 20 10000 10000 2500 5000 7500 5000 The dead space fraction (VD/VT) has now increased to 50%! Despite the fact that you have increased the respiratory rate and maintained the minute ventilation at the same level as before, the alveolar ventilation is lower than on the original ventilator settings (5000 mL/min vs7500 mL/min). If alveolar ventilation decreases in the setting of constant CO2 production, than the PaCO2 must increase. The main message is that when VD/VT increases in the setting of constant minute ventilation, the PaCO2 rises because the increased VD/VT translates into lower alveolar ventilation. 4. What could be done to lower the PaCO2? Remember that the PaCO2 reflects the balance between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation. CO2 production is difficult to manipulate (perhaps you could bring it down by cooling the person intentionally but we only consider that in very particular circumstances) so the only way for you to decrease the PaCO2 would be to raise the alveolar ventilation. We can do this by increasing minute ventilation by either increasing the respiratory rate or increasing the tidal volume. If the physiologic dead space remains constant, then raising minute ventilation will lead to an increase in alveolar ventilation. Over the following five days, he receives antibiotics and supportive care for his pneumonia and respiratory failure. Because he has a difficult time tolerating the ventilator, he is given large doses of opiates and benzodiazepines to keep him sedated. He is no longer breathing at a rate above the one set on the ventilator. He has been immobile much of the time because his oxygenation acutely worsens whenever he is moved. He is afebrile and his blood pressure has remained stable, but his heart rate is increased. On the morning of the sixth day in the ICU, the nurse sends an arterial blood gas and becomes concerned when the results are compared to the prior values. Last Night\\'s Value This Morning\\'s Value Parameter PaO2 (mm Hg) PaCO2 (mm Hg) 65 60 60 75 The ventilator settings have not changed between the two arterial blood gases. 5. What are possible explanations for why the patient\\'s PaCO2 has changed? The PaCO2 has risen overnight despite no changes in his ventilator settings (i.e., no changes in his minute ventilation). It is possible that CO2 production has increased in the face of unchanged alveolar ventilation. However, nothing described with the patient suggests his metabolic state has changed (e.g., no new fever) and therefore CO2 production has likely remained constant. Given this, it is more likely that alveolar ventilation has gone down. If minute ventilation has remained the same, the only way for this to happen is if the dead space ventilation has increased. As noted above, physiologic dead space is a function of the CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 4 \\nCase 1 (continued) anatomic dead space and the alveolar dead space. Because we have not changed the tidal volume or done anything else that would affect the anatomic dead space, the dead space likely increased in this case because something happened to increase the amount of alveolar dead space. In terms of why this might happen, it is possible that his underlying lung disease is getting worse, leading to an altered pulmonary capillary bed and less perfusion of the open alveoli. A more plausible explanation is that he developed a pulmonary embolism. You will learn in Chapter 13 that immobilization is a risk factor for and tachycardia is a sign of pulmonary embolism. The blood clot in the lung blocks off some of the pulmonary vasculature, causing decreased/absent perfusion of ventilated alveoli, i.e., dead space. Optional Exercise: To further understand these concepts, consider the following thought exercise: On hospital day #10, he develops a fever to 40° and cloudy urine. He also develops extensive shivering. The respiratory therapist draws another arterial blood gas and notes that the PaCO2 is 10 mm Hg higher than earlier in the day despite the fact that there were no changes in the rate or tidal volume set on the ventilator since that time. He continues to breathe at the rate set on the ventilator because of the heavy sedation requirements. PaCO2 has increased because either CO2 production increased or his alveolar ventilation went down. The patient\\'s ventilator settings have not changed and he is not taking any breaths beyond the set rate on the ventilator so we can conclude that his minute ventilation has not changed. If we assume that his dead space fraction has remained constant, then his alveolar ventilation has likely remained stable as well. This implies that something has happened to increase his CO2 production, with the fever, extensive shivering and urinary tract infection being the most likely culprits. Higher CO2 production in the setting of constant alveolar ventilation will lead to a rise in the PaCO2. Harking back to our bathtub analogy where the level of water in the tube represents the alveolar and therefore the arterial CO2 tension, the faucet is now bringing more CO2 to the tub while the drain continues to let out the same amount each minute. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 5 \\n 6 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\nCase 2 A 37 year-old woman with asthma comes to clinic for a routine follow-up clinic appointment. She is feeling well at this time and has no complaints. On exam she appears well and the breath sounds that you hear are consistent with normal air movement into and out of the lung. You note that the abdomen moves outward during inspiration with expansion of the chest. Exhalation of air appears relaxed and passive without active contraction of any respiratory muscles. 1. Using the blank set of figures below, graph the changes in pleural pressure, alveolar pressure, airflow and lung volume during inhalation and exhalation. This question allows one to explore two fundamental relationships that affect how we move air in and out of the respiratory system. The first relationship is the flow equation: \\tAirflow=\\t Δ)*!\" (1) RAW refers to airway resistance while ΔP is the pressure difference (\"driving pressure\") between where flow starts and where flow ends. Basically, this equation states that airflow in the lung requires a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and alveolus. On inhalation: ΔP = PATM - PALV where ATM = atmospheric (ie at the mouth; by convention this is designated as 0) and ALV = alveolar. For air to move into the lung on inhalation, alveolar pressure must fall below atmospheric pressure (i.e., is negative). On exhalation: ΔP = PALV - PATM.For air to move out of the lung on exhalation, alveolar pressure must increase above atmospheric pressure (i.e., is positive). The question that follows is how these pressure changes are generated within the alveolus. They are generated by changing the volume of the lung. When the lung becomes larger during inhalation, alveolar pressure decreases and air flows in from the atmosphere. When the lung decreases in size during exhalation due to elastic recoil, the alveolar pressure increases and air flows out of the lung to the atmosphere. This is where the second relationship comes into play, that of transmural pressure (PTM) which determines the volume of a distensible structure such as the lung, PTM = PIN-POUT (2) PIN refers to the pressure inside a distensible structure while POUT refers to the pressure outside the distensible structure. The greater the transmural pressure, the greater the volume of the distensible structure For the lung, at any volume, this relationship can be rewritten as: PALV refers to alveolar pressure while PPL refers to pleural pressure. PTM = PALV-PPL CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) above.\\tEquation 1 describes airflow in and out of the lung while Equation 2 describes the It is important to note that PALV (alveolar pressure) is found in both of the equations 8 transmural pressure across the lung that determines lung volume. During spontaneous breathing, the transmural pressure affects the volume of the lung which, in turn, alters PALV.These changes in PALV subsequently affect airflow. With these relationships in mind, we can look at the various graphs. We will begin with the changes in pleural and alveolar pressure, as they are the main factors affecting airflow. Pleural Pressure Over the Respiratory Cycle Due to the tendency of the lung to recoil inward and the chest wall to expand outward, pleural pressure is negative at functional residual capacity (about -5 cm H2O). To understand what happens during inhalation, we can review the basic mechanism of breathing at rest. Upon inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and descends into the abdomen. This causes the volume of the thorax to increase by two mechanisms: (1) descent of the diaphragm increases the vertical dimension of the chest cavity (2) flattening of the diaphragm pushes against the abdominal contents to lift the rib margins up and outward in the \"zone of apposition\" (where the diaphragm lies against the chest wall). As the chest cavity increases in volume (ie is pulled outward), the lungs continue to recoil inward, thereby causing pleural pressure to become more negative. Pleural pressure remains negative through the end of inhalation. During exhalation, as the volume of the thorax decreases, the tension between the chest wall and lung decreases and pleural pressure rises back toward -5 cm H2O.Do not worry about the shape of the relationship. You should just focus on the trend. Note that pleural pressure is always negative during spontaneous breathing at rest and always lower than alveolar pressure. Alveolar Pressure Over the Respiratory Cycle For a transient period at the start of inhalation, there is no airflow. Similarly, for a transient period at the transition from inhalation to exhalation, there is no airflow. Because airflow only occurs when there is a pressure gradient between where flow starts and where it ceases, we can conclude that alveolar pressure must be the same as the pressure at the mouth at CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) the start and end on inhalation. In other words, alveolar pressure must be zero (equal to PATM). (Points A and B in the figure below). Alveolar pressure decreases in the initial phase of inhalation. Why does this happen? Because the lungs are linked to the chest wall through the pleural space, as the thorax expands in this manner, the lungs expand to the same volume. According to the principles of Boyle\\'s Law, as the volume of the lung, and therefore, the volume of the alveoli, increase, the pressure in the alveoli and airways must decrease. Alveolar pressure falls below the pressure at the mouth (atmospheric pressure), setting up the pressure gradient (i.e., the driving pressure) that causes air to flow into the lungs. As air molecules enter the alveolar space, alveolar pressure starts to rise until returning to zero at the end of inhalation. For airflow to occur on exhalation, alveolar pressure must rise above the pressure at the mouth (i.e., must be positive). This occurs due to the elastic recoil of the lung. Alveolar pressure rises towards a peak but as air molecules exit the alveolus, it falls back to zero by end- exhalation. Having examined the changes in pleural and alveolar pressure, we can now examine the changes in airflow and lung volume. Airflow Over the Respiratory Cycle At the transition points between the different phases of the respiratory cycle, there is a transient static moment in which there is zero airflow. (Note: by convention, we think of airflow inward as positive. This is the opposite of what you will see with flow volume loops when we learn about pulmonary function testing). CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 9 \\nCase 2 (continued) As alveolar pressure decreases on inhalation, as shown above, a pressure gradient is created between the mouth and the alveolar space, which, based on the principles of Equation 1 above, causes air to flow into the lung. This is the \"driving pressure\" Flow is maximal when the driving pressure is at its greatest (about mid-inhalation). As air molecules move into the alveolar spaces, alveolar pressure rises and the driving pressure gets smaller. As a result, flow steadily decreases back to zero. As alveolar pressure rises on exhalation due to the elastic recoil of the lung, a pressure gradient is again created between the mouth and the alveolar space. This, again, is the driving pressure. Because the pressure is higher in the alveolar space than at the mouth, air flows in the opposite direction. Flow is maximal when the driving pressure is at its greatest (about mid-exhalation). As air molecules leave the alveolar spaces, alveolar pressure decreases and the driving pressure gets smaller. As a result, flow steadily moves back to zero. Volume Over the Respiratory Cycle On the surface, the changes in lung volume with respiration are quite simple. Over the course of inhalation, lung volume increases while over the course of exhalation, lung volume decreases. Note that lung volume does not fall to zero at any point in the respiratory cycle. With resting breathing, inhalation begins and exhalation ends at functional residual capacity, the volume at which the recoil pressure of the lung is exactly balanced by the recoil pressure of the chest wall. To understand why this is the case, we can think about the problem in terms of transmural pressure. The volume of any distensible structure is a function of the transmural pressure across the wall of that structure. The higher the transmural pressure, the greater the deviation in volume from resting volume. Recall from above that the transmural pressure of the lung is: PTM = PALV-PPL CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 10 \\nCase 2 (continued) Note that at the start of inhalation, the transmural pressure is at its minimum value. As a result, lung volume is at its lowest point during resting breathing (ie it\\'s at FRC). Note that at end-inhalation, the transmural pressure is at its maximum. As a result, lung volume is at its maximum value for the respiratory cycle. The patient returns to clinic two weeks later complaining of increasing dyspnea, chest tightness and wheezing over a several day period. On exam you now note an elevated pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate. On lung exam, you note that she is working harder to breathe than on his prior clinic visit. You appreciate that her expiratory phase is prolonged and hear polyphonic musical sounds consistent with wheezing. You also note strong contraction of the rectus abdominis muscles during exhalation. 2. Why are her rectus abdominus muscles contracting on exhalation? This patient is most likely having an exacerbation of her underlying asthma. To understand why she is contracting the rectus abdominis muscles during an exacerbation, we can return to the flow equation and consider what happens with each term: Airflow=\\tΔPR$+ In general, resistance to airflow is a function of three factors: Viscosity of the gas Length of the airways: resistance is directly proportional to length Caliber of the airways resistance is proportional to 1/radius4 During asthma exacerbations, multiple problems increase airway resistance by reducing airway caliber, including mucosal edema, bronchial smooth muscle contraction and increased mucous production. Recall that the airways are tethered open by the elastic recoil of the alveoli that surround the airways; the tendency of individual alveoli to collapse to a lower volume pulls open the neighboring alveoli and airways. The greater the volume of an alveolus, the greater the elastic recoil and the greater the tethering effect. The resistance problems noted above are exacerbated on exhalation because these tethering forces that help maintain airway patency decrease as alveolar volume falls. To counteract the increase in resistance and maintain airflow, the individual must create a higher driving pressure. This is done by forcibly contracting accessory muscles of exhalation, such as the rectus abdominis and internal intercostals. This raises pleural and alveolar pressure higher than in her healthy state, thereby increasing the driving pressure on exhalation. If driving pressure does not increase enough to overcome the added airway resistance, however, airflow is diminished compared to the healthy state.

Following a work-up in the Emergency Department, he is transported to the ICU for ongoing management and remains on the ventilator for several days. 1. In general terms, how does atmospheric air get into and out of the lungs while a patient is receiving mechanical ventilation? To move air through a tube, there must be a pressure gradient such that pressure is higher where flow starts than where it ends. Unlike spontaneous breathing, where alveolar pressure is decreased below atmospheric pressure during inhalation, mechanical ventilation uses what is referred to as \"positive pressure ventilation.\" The ventilator increases the pressure at the mouth. With pressure higher at the mouth than at the alveoli, air flows down the pressure gradient into the lungs. A comparison of pressure changes in spontaneous and mechanical ventilation is shown in the figure below (Figure 4-8 from the syllabus). Exhalation remains a passive process even when patients are receiving mechanical ventilation. The ventilator does not suck the air out of the lungs. At the end of an inspiration, the ventilator cycles off and lowers the pressure at the mouth. Due to the passive recoil of the respiratory system, air flows down the pressure gradient from the alveoli to the endotracheal tube. The ventilator is set to deliver a tidal volume of 600 mL.It is also set such that at the end of exhalation the pressure in the airway is 5 cm H2O rather than falling to 0 cm H2O.This is referred to as Positive End-Expiratory Pressure or PEEP.A curve demonstrating the airway pressure changes over time during mechanical ventilation is shown in the figure below. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 13 \\nCase 3 (continued) 2. The highest point reached during each inhalation is referred to as the Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP). What factors determine how high this value will be with each breath? Peak inspiratory pressure is measured by the ventilator at the opening to the respiratory system (i.e., at the mouth). In essence, this value tells us how hard the ventilator must work in order to move air through the airways and expand the respiratory system. The harder the machine works to achieve these tasks, the higher the peak inspiratory pressure. This value is a function of two variables: Airway Resistance: The higher the resistance, the higher the pressure gradient must be between the mouth and alveolus at the start of the breath to drive airflow. Compliance: As air moves into the alveoli, alveolar pressure rises, thereby increasing the transmural pressure across the respiratory system (PTM = Palveolar - Patmospheric). How much volume change occurs for a given change in transmural pressure is a function of the compliance of the system. If the system is very compliant, only a small change in transmural pressure is needed to deliver the desired tidal volume whereas in a stiff/non- compliant system a greater change in transmural pressure is necessary to deliver the same volume. From this, we can see that the lower the compliance of the system (i.e., the stiffer the system) the harder the ventilator has to work. The respiratory therapist performs an \"inspiratory pause\" maneuver. The tidal volume is delivered to the patient and, once the air has entered the system the system is paused and exhalation is prevented for 2 seconds. The pressure measured during this pause is called the \"static\" or \"plateau\" pressure. This is depicted in the figure below. 3. What information does the pressure measured during the inspiratory pause tell us? At the moment the system is paused, airflow ceases. Because airway resistance only applies when gas is moving through the airways, when the system is paused, the ventilator is no longer doing any work against resistance. As a result, the pressure measured during that pause solely reflects the transmural pressure needed to hold the system open at that volume. Technically, the ventilator is actually measuring the pressure in the alveolus during the pause maneuver but because the transmural pressure for the entire respiratory system is the difference between alveolar pressure and the pressure outside the chest wall 14 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\n(atmospheric pressure, which we treat as 0 cm H2O when assessing lung mechanics), transmural pressure and alveolar pressure are essentially the same in this situation. Given this, we can see that the pressure measured during this pause maneuver is a function of the compliance of the system. The stiffer or less compliant the system, the greater the transmural pressure must be to keep the system open at that volume. Keep in mind that the static pressure measured during this pause is reflective of the compliance of the entire respiratory system but is not the same as compliance. Compliance of the respiratory system (RS) is measured as follows: Compliance*,=ΔVΔP Case 3 (continued) where DV is the tidal volume and DP is the static pressure minus the PEEP (i.e., the pressure in the airway at end-exhalation). In general, the higher the static pressure, the lower compliance. To determine compliance precisely, however, you must know the volume being delivered and the PEEP.Several hours later the respiratory therapist notices that the peak inspiratory pressure has increased from 40-45 cm H2O.To determine why this occurred, she performs another inspiratory pause maneuver and compares the static pressure to the one obtained earlier (See figure below). The patient was receiving 600 mL/breath during each of these maneuvers. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 15 \\nCase 3 (continued): 4. Describe the observed change in the graphical waveforms from the ventilator. What factors could account for such a change? As noted earlier, the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is determined by the airway resistance and the compliance of the respiratory system. Therefore, when the peak pressure increases, it must due to either some problem that increased airway resistance or some problem that decreased respiratory system compliance. To determine which is playing the larger role, the respiratory therapists perform an inspiratory pause maneuver as this allows one to measure the static pressure and determine whether or not compliance has changed. Two patterns can be observed in this situation: PIP Increased / Static Pressure Increased: Provided tidal volume has not changed, an increase in the static pressure indicates that the compliance of the system has gone down. In other words, because the system is stiffer, more pressure must be applied to keep it open at that volume. PIP Increased / Static Pressure Unchanged: Provided tidal volume has not changed, constant static pressure indicates that compliance has not changed. Therefore, the increase in PIP must be due to a problem that increased airway resistance. In this case, the increase in PIP was accompanied by an increase in the static pressure. As a result, we know that the patient has some new problem affecting the compliance of their respiratory system. This could be due to one of several factors: Lung problems: processes like pulmonary edema or the Acute Respiratory Distress syndrome decrease the elasticity of the lung parenchyma. Pleural space problems: Fluid accumulation in the pleural space, know as pleural effusions, impinge on the ability of the lungs to expand on inhalation. Pneumothorax - air in the pleural space - or large pleural masses can cause the same problem. Chest wall problems: A stiff chest wall due to massive edema (anasarca), circumferential burns or morbid obesity make it harder to expand the entire respiratory system by decreasing the tendency of the chest wall to expand outward. Abdomen problems: A massively distended abdomen (e.g., tense ascites) impairs the ability of the diaphragm to descend on inhalation, which in turn, makes it difficult to expand the lungs on inhalation. 5. If you were to consider the compliance of this patient\\'s respiratory system and its components when he was in a healthy state prior to the motorcycle collision, how would it compare to that seen in those at the extremes of age (i.e., infants and the elderly)? Compliance is one aspects of respiratory function that changes across the age spectrum. Infants have more compliant chest walls than adults. As a result, FRC, which is determined by the balance of recoil forces between the lung and the chest wall, is decreased in infants. By the second year of life, the chest wall stiffens sufficiently and compliance decreases such that FRC is higher. At the other extreme of the age range, elderly patients have increased lung parenchymal compliance compared to younger individuals, but chest wall compliance is decreased due to stiffening of the cartilage in the thoracic cage and, in individuals, kyphosis and loss of height in the vertebral spine. The net results is that overall respiratory system compliance is less than that seen in younger adults. 16 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\nCase 4 A 47 year-old woman is admitted to the hospital after presenting with progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness over a period of two weeks. Her symptoms initially started in her lower legs but have since progressed to the point that she is having trouble rising from a seated position. She has no underlying medical problems and has otherwise been well except for a short diarrheal illness following a trip to Mexico. She denies recent trauma and her evaluation in the Emergency Department revealed no evidence of vertebral injury or a spinal cord lesion. On exam, she was noted to have decreased strength and absent deep tendon reflexes in her bilateral lower extremities but her sensation was intact. Following admission, the hospitalist caring for the patient asked the respiratory therapist to conduct a few tests at the bedside. The respiratory therapist performed a test called spirometry during which she asked the patient to inhale to a maximal extent and then exhale as forcefully as she could until her lungs felt empty. The volume of air exhaled in this maneuver - referred to as the vital capacity - was only 43% of what you would expect for a woman of her age and height. The respiratory therapist then had the patient take a maximum inhalation against a closed valve to assess her maximum inspiratory pressure. She then repeated the same maneuver with a forced exhalation against a closed valve to measure her maximum expiratory pressure. Both of these values were reduced to less than 40% of what you would predict for someone of her age and height. 1. What changes would you expect to see in her PaCO2? How will these observed changes affect the CO2 content of her arterial blood? The clinical history strongly suggests this patient is suffering from a neuromuscular disorder. The pattern of ascending weakness with preserved sensation, particularly following a recent diarrheal illness, is concerning for a problem known as Guillan-Barre Syndrome. A critical issue in this acute disorder is whether or not the weakness extends to the muscles of respiration. The tests the hospitalist asked the respiratory therapist to perform are intended to assess the patient\\'s muscle strength and, in particular, the strength of the diaphragm. In order to attain a high vital capacity, the individual must be able to inhale deeply and exhale with great force. Both of those tasks require muscular strength (this test assesses other variables too and will be covered in more detail later in the course). The maximum inspiratory pressure refers to how far alveolar pressure can be decreased on inhalation while the maximum expiratory pressure refers to how high airway pressure can be raised on exhalation. Both of these tests are also a function of muscular strength: the weaker the patient, the smaller the airway pressure change they can achieve in each phase of the respiratory cycle. The patient\\'s performance on both of these tests was highly abnormal, as she attained values that were very low relative to what you would predict for someone her age, gender and height. This suggests that her disease is now affecting her respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm. Whenever a patient has weak respiratory muscles, this raises concern that they will not be able to maintain sufficient minute and alveolar ventilation to eliminate the carbon dioxide being produced through their metabolic activity. In other words, they are at risk for CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 17 \\nCase 4 (continued) hypoventilation and, as a result, an increase in the PaCO2. If she can compensate for the lower tidal volumes that result for her muscle weakness by increasing her respiratory rate, she may be able to maintain her ventilation at a sufficient level to maintain a normal PaCO2. If she cannot compensate adequately for the lower tidal volumes, her PaCO2 will increase. Carbon dioxide is carried in the blood in three forms: in solution, as bicarbonate ion and bound to the terminal ends of the hemoglobin chains (carbamino groups). As the PaCO2 increases, the amount of CO2 stored in each form increases and the total CO2 content of the blood rises. 2. Using the blank figure below, compare the content curves for oxygen and carbon dioxide in healthy individuals. What is the physiologic significance of the differences between these two curves? 18 The figure above depicts the normal content curves for carbon dioxide and oxygen. The normal arterial (a) and venous (v) values are denoted by the dots. A comparison of the curves for oxygen and carbon dioxide reveals several important differences. First, note that at any given partial pressure, there is far more carbon dioxide in the blood than oxygen. Most of this carbon dioxide is stored in the form of bicarbonate ion. Second, we can see that over the normal physiologic range for these gases, the content curve for carbon dioxide is far steeper than the content curve for oxygen. For oxygen: as blood passes through the pulmonary capillaries, the PO2 must rise from 40 mm Hg to 100 mm Hg (a 60 mm Hg difference) to load sufficient quantities of oxygen into the blood for transport to the tissues. Similarly, as the blood traverse the capillary bed in the tissues, the PO2 must fall this same 60 mm Hg to offload enough oxygen to support tissue oxygen requirements. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers \\nCase 4 (continued) For carbon dioxide: as blood passes through the tissue capillaries, the PCO2 only needs to rise 6 mm Hg increase to load vast quantities of CO2 into the blood for transport to the lungs. Then, as the blood traverse the pulmonary capillary network in the lungs, the PCO2 only needs to fall 6 mm of Hg to offload a large quantity of CO2 into the alveoli where it is then be eliminated through alveolar ventilation. This difference in slope has important functional implications for respiratory function. Due to the steep slope of the CO2 dissociation curve, we are highly efficient at getting rid of carbon dioxide from the body. With just a small drop in the PCO2 in the lungs, blood carbon dioxide content falls significantly and large amounts of carbon dioxide are eliminated. Later in the course, we will learn about processes that cause significant problems with oxygenating the blood (e.g., severe pneumonia, ARDS). Despite all of the problems with getting oxygen into the system, many (but not all) of these patients never develop hypercarbia because of this efficiency of carbon dioxide elimination. 3. How will this patient\\'s clinical situation affect the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve? The increase in PaCO2 causes a rightward shift in the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, a phenomenon referred to as the Bohr effect. This leads to an increase in the P50 of hemoglobin and a decrease in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen such that for any PO2, the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation is lower. The change in affinity occurs for two reasons. The increased PaCO2 causes more carbamino formation, which changes the confirmation of hemoglobin, decreasing its oxygen affinity. In addition, the rise in PCO2 leads to an increase in hydrogen ion (H+) concentration, which has a similar effect on affinity. Outside of this clinical situation involving hypoventilating patient, the Bohr effect plays a major role in normal gas exchange as it facilitates oxygen loading onto hemoglobin in the lungs and release from hemoglobin in the tissues. As blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries past the alveoli, the PCO2 decreases as CO2 diffuses across the alveolar capillary barrier and is eliminated from the body. Hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen increases, making it easier to load on oxygen as blood passes by the alveoli. As blood traverses the capillary bed in the tissues, the PCO2 steadily rises. Hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen decreases, making it easier to offload the oxygen to the tissues to support their metabolic activity. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 2 Answers 19 \\nCase 4 (continued) Just as CO2 affects hemoglobin\\'s affinity for O2, O2 affects the extent to which CO2 forms carbamino groups at the ends of the hemoglobin chains. As the oxygen saturation increases, carbamino formation decreases and vice versa. Like the Bohr effect, the Haldane effect plays a role in CO2 exchange at the alveolus and in the tissues. As blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries, the PO2 and oxygen saturation increase as O2 diffuses across the alveolar capillary barrier. CO2 is released from the ends of the hemoglobin chains making it available to diffuse into the alveolus and be eliminated through ventilation. As blood traverses the capillary bed in the tissues, the PO2 and oxygen saturation steadily decrease. This makes it easier to load carbon dioxide onto the ends of the hemoglobin chains, thereby facilitating transport to the lungs.

Describe the location and construction of the sympathetic trunk and its connections to spinal Identify the contents and relationships of structures in the posterior mediastinum. nerves in relation to the posterior mediastinum. 4. Describe the azygos venous system and how it relates to collateral venous return to the heart. OVERVIEW OF THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM Recall that the mediastinum is divided into superior and inferior by the thoracic plane (Figure 1). The inferior mediastinum can be further divided into anterior, middle, and posterior by the pericardium. The posterior mediastinum is posterior to the pericardium. CONTENTS OF THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM The posterior mediastinum connects the neck and the superior mediastinum to the abdomen. Therefore, it contains many hollow structures that pass through the region. Figure 1. Divisions of the mediastinum ESOPHAGUS The esophagus was mentioned in the Superior Mediastinum chapter as the passageway for liquid and food boluses from the neck to the abdomen. In the posterior mediastinum, it lies anterior to the vertebral bodies near the midline (Figure 2). Recall from the Interior of the Heart chapter that the left atrium is directly anterior to the esophagus, making it the chamber that is closest to the probe in transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE; see relationship in CT shown in Figure 5). ARTERIES The thoracic (descending) aorta is the continuation of the aortic arch inferior to the thoracic plane (Figure 2). For most of the posterior mediastinum, the thoracic aorta lies on the left side of the vertebral bodies to the left of the esophagus (Figures 2 & 5). As the esophagus and thoracic aorta continue inferiorly, they begin to rotate around one another such that the esophagus is anterior to the aorta at the level of the diaphragm. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 1 \\nClinical correlate: Aortic dissections occur when the intima (inner wall) of the aorta is torn, creating a false lumen. Most aortic dissections involve the ascending aorta, either in isolation or along with the descending aorta (Stanford Type A). This type is especially dangerous given their potential to block flow through the branches of the aorta. Dissections involving the descending aorta in isolation (Stanford Type B) have a better prognosis. Aortic dissections can cause a dissecting aneurysm, swelling of the aorta caused by the pooling of blood in the false lumen. Conversely, a true aneurysm-which involves all the layers of the arterial wall-is a risk factor for aortic dissection and rupture of the aorta. As the thoracic aorta descends, it gives off arteries that reflect the segmental body plan. The posterior intercostal arteries are paired arteries that supply the body wall. They branch off the posterolateral aspect of the aorta and travel in the costal grooves (Figure 2; discussed in MCBD block). In addition, there are unpaired visceral branches that come off the anterior aspect of the aorta to supply the thoracic viscera. Of these, we will focus on the esophageal arteries to the esophagus and the bronchial arteries that supply oxygenated blood to bronchial tree and connective tissue of the lungs (separate from the pulmonary arteries, which carry deoxygenated blood). Figure 2. Esophagus and thoracic aorta Clinical correlate: The posterior intercostal arteries form an anastomosis with the anterior intercostal arteries that branch off the internal thoracic arteries. A coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta that develops distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery can lead to enhanced flow of blood through these anastomoses and the reversal of blood flow in the posterior intercostal arteries. This enlarges the anterior and posterior intercostal arteries, leading to rib notching that can be seen in chest radiographs (red arrows). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 2 \\nVEINS The azygos and hemiazygos veins are asymmetric longitudinal vessels that drain the posterior body wall (Figure 3; azygos = without a pair). On the right, the posterior intercostal veins drain into the azygos vein. The azygos vein then drains into the SVC at approximately the level of the sternal angle as the arch of the azygos vein. On the left, the posterior intercostal veins drain into the highly variable hemiazygos system. Some portion of the left posterior intercostal veins will always drain into the hemiazygos vein. The hemiazygos vein will then cross over the vertebral column to drain into the azygos vein. Sometimes, a separate accessory hemiazygos vein is present superior to the hemiazygos. When present, it also crosses the vertebral column to drain into the azygos vein. Figure 3. Azygos system of veins CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 3 \\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE Recall from Invaders & Defenders that the thoracic duct is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body (Figure 4). It drains lymph from both lower extremities, the pelvis and abdomen, and the left hemithorax, upper extremity, and head and neck. It begins inferior to the diaphragm as the cisterna chyli and ascends along the vertebral bodies posterior to the esophagus. The thoracic duct drains into the venous circulation at the left venous or jugulosubclavian angle. Clinical correlate: Because the thoracic duct drains lymph from the intestines, the fluid inside the duct contains chylomicrons transporting lipids that gives it a milky appearance. This fluid is referred to as chyle. Damage to the thoracic duct can lead to a chylothorax, a rare type of pleural effusion characterized by the accumulation of chyle in the pleural cavity that causes difficulty breathing. The right lymphatic duct drains lymph from the right upper quadrant into the right venous angle. It is much smaller than the thoracic duct with three tributaries that may empty directly into the right venous angle as separate vessels. Figure 4. Lymphatic drainage. Inset shows regions drained by thoracic (pink) and right lymphatic ducts (blue). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 4 \\nFigure 5. Axial CT with intravenous contrast at the level of the inferior mediastinum. The esophagus appears as a flattened structure. It is often distinguishable by the small amount of air in its lumen (see the three black dots in this example). Note the relationships of the large vessels in the posterior mediastinum. The thoracic duct lies between the esophagus and the vertebral bodies to the left of the azygos v (remember to orient to the patient). AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN THE POSTERIOR MEDIASTINUM PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Parasympathetic innervation in the posterior mediastinum originates in the vagus nerve (Figure 6). In the superior mediastinum, the vagus contributed branches to the cardiac and pulmonary plexuses. In the posterior mediastinum, the vagus continues as part of the esophageal plexus. The anterior vagal trunk coalesces inferiorly on the esophagus primarily from fibers from the left vagus. The posterior vagal trunk coalesces from the right vagus. Both trunks will cross the diaphragm with the esophagus to innervate abdominal viscera. Figure 6. Parasympathetic nervous system in the posterior mediastinum CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 5 \\nSYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM Recall the structural and conceptual aspects of the sympathetic nervous system that were covered in the Introduction to the Nervous System chapter in MCBD.Preganglionic sympathetic fibers originate in the lateral horns of the spinal cord at spinal levels T1-L2. In the posterior mediastinum, the white and gray rami communicantes connect the intercostal nerves with the sympathetic chain ganglia, generally one per level (Figure 7). The sympathetic trunk connects the chain ganglia along the lateral aspects of the vertebral bodies. Figure 7. Sympathetic nervous system in the posterior mediastinum. Inset shows schematic of ANS innervation of the heart. In the inset, red = sympathetic, blue = parasympathetic, SCG = sympathetic chain ganglia. The sympathetic innervation of the thoracic viscera originates from preganglionic fibers at spinal segments T1-T4. These fibers synapse in the sympathetic chain ganglia at or above these levels as far as the superior cervical ganglion near the skull (Figure 7 inset). Postganglionic fibers travel in cardiac, pulmonary, or esophageal splanchnic nerves that contribute to cardiac, pulmonary, and esophageal plexuses, respectively (recall that these plexuses contain both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers of the ANS as well as visceral afferents). Clinical correlate: Recall that visceral afferents transmitting pain signals travel back to the spinal cord with the sympathetics. This is the anatomical explanation for why pain from the heart refers to the T1-4 dermatomes that span the arm and chest wall to the level of the nipple (particularly on the left). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Posterior Mediastinum 6 \\nThe thoracic splanchnic nerves-greater, lesser, and least-arise from spinal levels T5-T12 to innervate the abdominal organs. Unlike the cardiopulmonary splanchnic nerves, the thoracic splanchnic nerves contain preganglionic fibers that did not synapse in the sympathetic chain ganglia. These preganglionic fibers synapse in the prevertebral ganglia in the abdomen, which we will cover thoroughly in the Energetics & Homeostasis block. For now, focus on the greater splanchnic nerve, which can be seen extending anteromedially from the sympathetic trunk along the vertebral bodies from T5-T9 (Figure 7).

Researchers are trying to determine how an experimental drug is handled by the kidney. They determine that the drug is freely filtered by the kidney, not reabsorbed, and completely secreted into the proximal tubule. a) Trace the path followed by the filtered portion of the drug through the nephron starting at the afferent arteriole. Afferent arteriole ==> glomerular tuft ==> Bowman\\'s capsule ==> proximal tubule ==> loop of Henle ==> distal tubule ==> cortical collecting tubule ==> renal pelvis ==> ureter b) Trace the path followed by the secreted portion of the drug through the nephron starting at the afferent arteriole. Afferent arteriole ==> glomerular tuft ==> efferent arteriole==> peritubular capillaries ==> proximal tubule ==> loop of Henle ==> distal tubule ==> cortical collecting tubule ==> renal pelvis ==> ureter c) What percentage of the drug found in the urine was filtered and what percentage was secreted? Twenty percent of renal plasma flow is filtered into Bowman\\'s space. Since the drug is freely filtered and not reabsorbed, 20% of the drug found in the urine was filtered. The remaining 80% of renal plasma enters the peritubular capillaries. Since the drug is completely secreted, 80% of the excreted drug was secreted. 2. A novel virus, medullavirus, is found to infect only the juxtamedullary nephrons, destroying them. The cortical nephrons are left intact. a) What percentage of all glomeruli have been affected? Juxtamedullary nephrons comprise 15% of all nephrons. Cortical nephrons comprise 85%. b) What consequence may this have on the ability of the kidney to concentrate urine? The juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops of Henle that descend deep in the medulla. Reabsorption of water in the thin descending loop and NaCl in the thick ascending loop increases the hyperosmolarity of the medullary interstitium  1 1 \\n(medullary interstitial gradient). In the medullary collecting duct, this allows water to be reabsorbed down its gradient from the tubule into blood, thereby concentrating the urine. Complete destruction of the juxtamedullary nephrons would severely impair the ability to concentrate urine. c) Explain how ADH mediates water reabsorption in the medullary collecting duct. Antidiuretic hormone binds to the V2 receptor where it activates a series of reactions that insert aquaporin 2 water channels into the luminal surface. Water is then reabsorbed from the tubular lumen, through the collecting duct cell, and into the blood. 3. Researchers develop a diabetes medication that prevents the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate and results in lower serum glucose. a) How is glucose reabsorbed by the nephron? Glucose is reabsorbed solely in the proximal tubule by sodium-glucose- cotransporters. Under physiological conditions SGLT2 reabsorbs 80-90% of filtered glucose, while SGLT1 reabsorbs the remaining 10-20% of glucose. The kidney\\'s threshold for glucose reabsorption is about 180 mg/dL in people without diabetes and about 220 mg/dL in people with diabetes. Glucose levels higher than this therefore result in glucosuria. b) In addition to glucose, what other substance\\'s reabsorption at this site will be reduced due to this medication? Since glucose is reabsorbed with sodium in the proximal tubule, the reabsorption of sodium will be reduced at this site. SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of medications used in the treatment of diabetes and diabetic kidney disease. They reduce serum glucose and have very modest diuretic and blood pressure effects. More notably, they have been shown to decrease the progression of diabetic kidney disease. (More info in the CKD chapter). 4. A 76 y/o woman presents to the ER for lightheadedness. She denies any other symptoms. Labs show that she has hypokalemia. She doesn\\'t remember the names of any of her medications and thinks that she may have accidentally doubled up her pills in her pill organizer. In an effort to identify the causative medication, the nephrology consult obtains a 24-hour urine, which shows hypercalciuria. a) The blockade of what transporter may be responsible for these findings? The NKCC (Na+/K+/2 Cl- cotransporter) enables the reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride in the ascending loop of Henle. Loop diuretics block this transporter and can cause hypokalemia, hypercalciuria, and increased magnesium excretion.  1 2 \\nb) How does this blockade result in hypercalciuria? NKCC is electroneutral since it transports 2 cations and 2 anions. However, some of the potassium that is reabsorbed by NKCC is recycled back into the lumen via the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel. This creates a positively charged tubular lumen which repels other cations such as Ca2+. Calcium is then reabsorbed via a paracellular pathway. If NKCC is blocked, the lumen does not become positively charged. Therefore, less calcium is reabsorbed. 5. During a workup for hypertension, a 28 y/o man is found to have hyperaldosteronism. a) Where in the nephron does aldosterone act and what are its actions? Aldosterone\\'s main actions are in the principal cells of the CCD where it activates ENaC and increases transcription of the channel. It also increases the transcription of the Na/K/ATPase resulting in increased Na+ reabsorption from the lumen. b) Would you expect potassium to be high or low in this condition? In hyperaldosteronism, electrogenic sodium reabsorption through ENaC creates electronegativity in the lumen. This promotes K secretion through the ROMK channel. Increased K secretion leads to a lower serum K.c) How is this condition different from Liddle\\'s syndrome? In Liddle\\'s syndrome, a mutation in ENaC leads to its continuous activity resulting in volume expansion. The volume expansion suppresses the renin- angiotensin- aldosterone system. Therefore, clinically, Liddle\\'s syndrome looks like hyperaldosteronism but with low aldosterone levels.  1 3 \\n CPR - Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 6: Answers to Acute Kidney Injury and Chronic Kidney Disease Part 1: Acute Kidney Injury Case 1 A 28 year-old man with a history of prior alcohol and drug use is found unconscious at home and taken to the ER.On examination he is drowsy, pulse 110, BP 90/60, and is without fever. He has no edema. Labs: 133 5.9 100 16 48 4.5 Blood glucose 85mg/dl Urine Studies: UA: 3+ blood, trace protein, trace glucose Urine microscopy: few pigmented granular casts. No red blood cells. Urine lytes: UNa 44, Uosm 288, Ucreat 50 1. What is the differential diagnosis of his acute kidney injury? Differential diagnosis: In any patient with AKI, this may be broadly divided into: (A) Pre-renal AKI: If the kidney is not adequately perfused, urine output will decrease. Decreased perfusion can be from a variety of sources: hypotension and/or decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) are the two most common causes. (B) Intra-renal process: AKI can occur secondary to injury to any site within the kidney a. Vascular: clot/embolism, dissection, vasculitis, atheroemboli, thrombotic microangiopathy b. Glomerulonephritis - urine sediment with RBCs, RBC casts c. Acute tubular necrosis - ischemic or nephrotoxic : muddy brown casts d. Acute interstitial nephritis - fever, rash, urine-sediment with eosinophils and WBCs or WBC casts. (C) Obstruction (post-renal): Obstruction is the easiest cause of renal failure to rule out. Make sure that there is no outflow obstruction (especially in men who are at risk for prostatic enlargement). Place a foley catheter and make sure it is working. Get a renal ultrasound to rule out compression of the ureters. In this young man, the most likely diagnoses would be pre-renal AKI, ATN (toxic, rhabdomyolysis) or less likely an acute glomerulonephritis. 2. Will the serum creatinine help with the etiology?  7 Answers 1 \\nNo. The serum creatinine will only tell you that renal function has deteriorated. It won\\'t direct you to the possible cause. A BUN to creatinine ratio > 20:1 may point toward a pre-renal cause but is not sufficiently specific to make the diagnosis. 3. How do you interpret his urine studies (UA, microscopy and Urine electrolytes)? The urine sodium concentration is elevated despite the low eGFR suggesting that the tubules are injured and \"spilling\" sodium. The presence of glucose in the urine also suggests proximal tubular injury. The presence of granular casts (\"muddy brown casts\") is indicative of acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In a pre-renal setting, one would expect a low urine Na and high urine osmolality as the kidney appropriately tries to hold on to Na and volume. The urinalysis shows 3+ blood, but note the microscopy does not show any red cells. This is suggestive of heme pigment nephropathy as a cause of ATN.Rhabdomyolysis from being \"found down\" and muscle compression is the most likely etiology. 4. What are the major complications of AKI? Complications of AKI include: volume overload (if patient remains oliguric), electrolyte problems (hyperkalemia), acidosis, and altered mentals status/seizures if severe. 5. What are the major indications for acute dialysis? Acute indications for dialysis: volume overload, severe hyperkalemia, CNS dysfunction (somnolence, coma, seizures); pericarditis. Case 2 A 15 year-old was well until 10 days ago when she noted the onset of a sore throat and fever. She was treated with penicillin for presumed strep throat. The patient states that she initially felt better, but now has recurrence of her fever. In addition, she complains of diffuse myalgias and anorexia. Vital signs include temp 38oC, BP 134/68 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows a diffuse maculo-papular rash on her chest and arms. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable. Laboratory values: BUN WBC Creatinine Urinalysis: Specific gravity 1.01; no protein, glucose, ketones or Hb detected by dipstick. Urine sediment: 10-20 WBC per high power field, several WBC casts, no RBC\\'s 50mg/dl 11.5 3.0mg/dl 1. What is the differential diagnosis of the patient\\'s increased creatinine? As in all cases of acute kidney injury (AKI), pre-renal, post-renal and intra-renal causes must be considered. Considerations for AKI include: 1. Prerenal azotemia (though there is no evidence from the history or physical examination that the patient is volume depleted), 2. Intra-renal: glomerulonephritis, acute interstitial nephritis or 3. Post-renal. 2. Given the patient\\'s history and physical examination, what is the most likely etiology of the kidney injury? 2  7 Answers \\nThe most likely cause of kidney injury in this patient is intra-renal disease. The patient\\'s history, physical exam and UA are all consistent with a diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Specifically, this diagnosis is supported by the recent exposure to penicillin and new onset fever, a diffuse maculopapular rash, and pyuria (wbcs in urine). Drugs, especially antibiotics, account for about 75% of cases of AIN.A classic triad of rash, fever and eosinophilia occurs in 10% of cases. 3. What would a renal biopsy likely show? Renal biopsy would likely show patchy or diffuse infiltration of the interstitium with mononuclear cells and eosinophils. The glomeruli and vessels would appear normal. 4. What treatment would you recommend? Discontinuation of the offending drug usually leads to complete resolution of the renal disease in a period of weeks to months. A course of prednisone may be considered in very severe cases or if no improvement in kidney function is seen 5-7 days after discontinuing drug Case 3 64 year-old man is admitted with nausea and AKI (serum creatinine 6.6 mg/dl). He has a history of rectal carcinoma diagnosed 4 years previously treated with resection, and neoadjuvant radiation. Other past history includes type 2 diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Examination reveals an unwell looking man. Pulse 96, blood pressure 132/76, temp 37.4oC.He appears euvolemic; chest and abdominal exam are unremarkable. He is admitted and treated with intravenous saline and a urinary catheter is placed to exclude obstruction, however his renal function does not improve. Labs: 136 Na 5.8 K 108 Cl HCO3 14 BUN 65 Creatinine 6.6 Glucose 68 Urinalysis: 1+ protein. Urine sediment shows non-dysmorphic red cells, no casts. Urine electrolytes (mmol/L): UNa 32, UK 24; UCl 64 1. What other investigations would be important for this man? This man presents with advanced renal impairment which does not respond to IV fluids making pre-renal less likely (his UNa >10 also makes this less likely). He does have red cells in his urine raising the possibility of a glomerulonephritis, however, the cells are non-dysmorphic and there are no casts. The few red cells may have resulted from urinary catheter placement. Similarly, the lack of muddy brown casts makes ATN less likely.  7 Answers 3 \\n2. What is the most likely diagnosis and how should this be treated? He does have a history of rectal carcinoma, and obstruction remains very high up the list of diagnoses. Although he has a urinary catheter, this will only relieve obstruction at the bladder outlet level. Indeed, an US confirmed bilateral hydronephrosis at the level of the ureters. The acute treatment for this is to relieve the obstruction. This may be achieved by placement of stents in his ureters or placement of bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy tubes to ensure urinary drainage. After short term drainage has been achieved, longer term plans for urinary drainage (eg surgery) need to be determined. The etiology may be due to recurrent tumor, adhesions from previous surgery or radiation injury. Note obstruction can cause both AKI and CKD.Part 2: Chronic Kidney Disease Case 1 A 38 year-old man with a 16 year history of diabetes mellitus presents to your office with nausea and vomiting for the past 2 weeks. He also notes shortness of breath- both at rest and with exertion and swelling of his legs. He is homeless and has not seen a doctor in over 3 years. He is currently is taking no medications other than insulin as needed. Exam: BP 188/110; HR 120 ; Temp 36.5 Lungs- bilateral rales 1/3 of his lung fields; Heart S1, S2 + S4, with a pericardial friction rub JVP- increased to about 12 cm above the sternal notch Extremities - 2+ edema bilaterally Laboratory values: Urinalysis: 3+ protein, 3+ glucose, 2+ blood Urine sediment: many broad waxy casts, 5-10 RBCs/ hpf Na K Cl HCO3 130 5 108 18 BUN Creatinine Hematocrit Hgb MCV 125 13 22 8 92 How would you differentiate acute from chronic kidney disease? The best way to differentiate AKI from CKD are with previous medical records. If this information is unavailable, then a renal US with small (<9cm) kidneys bilaterally supports the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Additionally, anemia from erythropoietin deficiency may be present in the later stages of chronic kidney disease. Though he has nausea and vomiting, he appears volume overloaded. Therefore, it is most likely that the nausea and vomiting are symptoms of 4  7 Answers \\nuremia rather than a cause of pre-renal AKI.Additionally, his urine output may be helpful as oligoanuria would not be expected in CKD.1. Identify this patient\\'s complications associated with CKD and explain the likely pathogenesis of each There are several manifestations of CKD described: Volume Overload: This is likely due to impaired salt excretion from his CKD in addition to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) as evidenced by the S4 on exam. Pericardial friction rub: This physical finding suggests pericarditis with a pericardial effusion. An echo should be obtained to determine its hemodynamic significance. Anemia: The patient\\'s normocytic anemia is likely from decreased erythropoietin. However, serum iron studies should be obtained to assess for chronic blood loss from the GI tract. Hypertension: The hypertension is likely secondary to increased vascular stiffness and salt retention/volume overload. His S4 suggests that longstanding hypertension may have contributed to left ventricular hypertrophy. Metabolic acidosis: His HCO3 is low due to impaired ammoniagenesis in CKD.2. What indications does he have for initiation of hemodialysis? The most pressing reason to start dialysis in this patient is his pericardial friction rub, which suggests that he has uremic pericarditis and a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions may have severe hemodynamic consequences. From the available data, it seems that he has had progression of CKD and is now symptomatic. Since there is no method to reverse chronic kidney disease, dialysis should be started to provide symptomatic relief. In general, GI symptoms such as anorexia and nausea/ vomiting improve shortly after initiation of dialysis. Symptoms of shortness of breath can be improved rapidly with volume removal with dialysis. His lab values alone do not warrant initiation of dialysis in the absence of other symptoms. Case 2 A 45 year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease secondary to biopsy proven hypertensive nephrosclerosis attends nephrology clinic. Symptomatically he is doing well, but noticed a little drop in his energy levels. He has no GI symptoms or SOB but has a mild itch. He has a family history of premature myocardial infarction. Exam reveals an alert man, BP 125/75 on medications who is euvolemic.  7 Answers 5 \\n Labs: Na K Cl HCO3 BUN 139 4.8 103 22 58 Creatinine Ca PO4 PTH Hematocrit 3.6 8.3 (normal 8.8-10.1 mg/dl) 6.8 (normal 3.0-4.5mg/dl) 252 (normal 12-88 pg/ml) 32% 1. What are the clinical concerns regarding the altered calcium & PO4 metabolism? Traditionally we have been concerned about the effects of these mineral disorders on bone disease (previously called renal osteodystrophy). More recently, we have recognized the impact of these parameters on cardiovascular disease and the term CKD-MBD (chronic kidney disease - mineral bone disorder) has emerged to recognize these broader implications. Specific issues: - Bone disease: typically high turnover bone disease due to secondary hyperparathyroidism - Metastatic calcification. A high Ca-PO4 product may promote calcification in vessels, heart valves, and skin (itch, calciphylaxis) - Increased cardiovascular risk 2. Describe the altered physiology leading to the elevated PTH levels. a) Elevated phosphorus levels stimulate PTH and decrease circulating free Ca levels. PTH attempts to return phosphorus levels to normal by increasing urinary phosphorus excretion. b) Impaired production of 1,25-OH Vit D increases PTH levels and decreases intestinal Ca absorption resulting in hypocalcemia c) Hypocalcemia is a potent stimulator of PTH.PTH, in turn, increases Ca release from bones, increases kidney Ca reabsorption, and stimulates 1-alpha- hydroxylation of 25- OH vit D.How do you manage these abnormalities? a) Dietary PO4 restriction via decreases in processed foods and dairy products. b) PO4 binders: These are taken with meals to bind PO4 in food inhibiting reabsorption. c) 1,25- Vit D supplementation (calcitriol) can be given to reduce PTH levels. This medication will also increase calcium and phosphorus absorption in the intestine, so hyperphosphatemia should be managed first. Case 3 A 56 year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease and diabetic kidney disease attends nephrology clinic. She is noted to have a BP of 155/78 and 2+ edema. Her father was on dialysis and she wants to know how she can slow down the progression of her kidney disease. How should you counsel her? 6  7 Answers \\nNa K Cl HCO3 BUN 137 4.5 103 19 25 Creatinine PO4 Hematocrit 24hr urine protein 1.5 5.5 32% 2.1g/24h Interventions to slow progression of her kidney disease include: 1. Lifestyle measures. Weight loss may significantly reduce proteinuria & improve BP and blood sugars. A low Na diet improves BP control and may reduce proteinuria. 2. Blood pressure control. In a patient with diabetes and proteinuria, controlling blood pressure slows progression. This often requires 2-3 antihypertensives medications in addition to lifestyle measures (weight loss, Na restriction, etc.) 3. RAAS blockade. In proteinuric CKD, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers should be used as blood pressure tolerates. These medications reduce intraglomerular pressure resulting in decreased proteinuria and slower progression of disease. These medications also reduce other mediators of renal injury (TGF-beta, PDGF, oxidative stress) 4. SGLT2 inhibitors: SGLT2 inhibitors block reabsorption of sodium with glucose in the proximal tubule leading to glucosuria, natriuresis, and improved glycemic control. They decrease progression of CKD likely through a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. 5. Glycemic control: More effective at earlier stages. 6. Treatment of metabolic acidosis: Metabolic acidosis is associated with faster progression of CKD.Though a causal link has not been established, possible mechanisms include activation of the RAAS and endothelin-1, a potent renal vasoconstrictor. Small studies have shown modest improvement in progression of CKD with bicarbonate supplementation.  7 Answers 7 \\n Cardiovascular Pulmonary Renal Course Syllabus Winter 2021 University of Washington School of Medicine \\n \\nRenal Physiology and Pathophysiology 2021 Syllabus Table of Contents CPR Chapter Title Associated In-Class Session Kidney Tubule Physiology and Histology Glomerular Physiology Measurement of Kidney Function Volume Disorders Disorders of Water Balance Potassium Disorders Acid-Base Disorders Acute Kidney Injury Chronic Kidney Disease Assessment of the Urine Glomerular Disease Kidney Stones (Nephrolithiasis) Hypertension Pathophysiology Hypertension Treatment Day 227 Hours 1 and 2 Tubular Physiology and Histology Day 28-Hour 1 Glomerular Physiology Day 28-Hour 2 Measurement of GFR Day 29-Hours 1 and 2 Sodium Interactive Day 29-Hours 1 and 2 Sodium Interactive Day 30-Hour 2 Potassium Interactive Day 31-Hours 1 and 2 Acid Base Interactive Day 32-Hour 2 Acute Kidney Injury Day 33-Hour 1 Chronic Kidney Disease Day 33-Hour 2 Assessment of the Urine Day 34-Hours 1 and 2 Glomerular Disease Day 34-Hour 3 Kidney Stones Day 35-Hour 1 Day 35-Hour 2 Hypertension Hypertension Pathophysiology Pharmacologic Management of Conference Materials See Schedule At Start of Section 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 - \\n \\n Sodium Potassium Chloride Total CO2 (bicarbonate) BUN Creatinine Calcium Phosphorus Magnesium Albumin Serum Osmolality pH PaO2 PaCO2 Hematocrit Hemoglobin White cell count Platelet count 135-145 mmol/l 3.6-5.0 mmol/l 98-108 mmol/l 22-30 mmol/l 8-12 mg/dl 0.7-1.2 mg/dl 8.8-10.1 mg/dl 3.0-4.5 mg/dl 1.6-2.4 mmol/l 3.5-5 g/dl 280-285mOsm/kg 7.35-7.45 85-95 mm Hg 35-45 mm Hg 42-50% (M) 36-44% (F) 13.5-16.5 g/dl (M) 12-15g/dl (F) 4,000-10,000 / mm3 100,000 - 450,000 Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Complete Blood Count (CBC) Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology Normal Values for Common Lab Parameters The table below lists normal values for several different parameters that you will encounter in this section of the course.

Describe the structure of the kidneys and their blood supply. Describe the structure of the glomerulus and the glomerular filtration barrier. Explain the basic renal processes: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. FUNCTIONS OF THE KIDNEY Excretion of waste products Urinary excretion is the principal route for excretion of certain metabolic wastes and drugs. Metabolic wastes include urea (from protein metabolism), uric acid (from nucleic acids) and creatinine (from muscle). Electrolyte Homeostasis The content of electrolytes in the body is kept in balance between input (from diet or metabolism) and output (mostly urine, lesser so - feces, sweat). The kidney plays a critical role in controlling the body content of the following electrolytes: Na+, K+, H+, HCO3 Water Homeostasis Water balance depends on control of input (thirst) and urinary excretion (anti- diuretic hormone). Both are closely controlled to regulate the amount of water in the body (osmolality) and thus the concentrations of electrolytes in body fluids. Control of Arterial Blood Pressure The kidney plays a critical role in the regulation of blood pressure. It does so by two major processes: , Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and PO4 3-. - 1. Na+ reabsorption. Blood pressure depends on blood volume, which is dependent on the kidney\\'s ability to control salt and water balance. 2. Renin secretion. Kidneys secrete the enzyme renin, thus activating the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) (see Chapter 2).  1 1 \\nSecretion of Erythropoietin Erythropoietin (Epo) is a glycoprotein hormone that is secreted by interstitial fibroblasts in the deep renal cortex and outer medulla. Epo is produced in response to tissue hypoxia, is secreted into the circulation, and acts on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to stimulate erythropoiesis (red cell production). In end stage renal disease (ESRD) this source of Epo is reduced and patients may become severely anemic. This can be prevented by administration of recombinant erythropoietin. Production of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D The enzyme 1alpha-hydroxylase is found in the kidney (mostly proximal tubule) and is responsible for the production of the active form of vitamin D (1,25 (OH)2-Vit D, calcitriol), which is critical in calcium and bone homeostasis. Gluconeogenesis Although the liver is the primary organ, gluconeogenesis also occurs in the renal cortex during fasting (Note: the kidneys also play a role in the metabolism of insulin). THE NEPHRON The nephron is a hollow tube consisting of a single layer of epithelial cells and is the composed of the glomerulus and renal tubule. (Figure 1.1). There are about 1 million nephrons per adult human kidney. Nephrogenesis continues into the 8th month of embryonic life, and infants that are born prematurely may not develop the full complement of nephrons (decreased nephron number) which may lead to an increased risk of hypertension and kidney disease in later life. There are two types of nephrons, depending on their location and structure: Cortical nephrons (85%) have their glomeruli in the outer 2/3 of the cortex. They have short loops of Henle that descend to the cortex or penetrate only the outer layers of the medulla. Juxtamedullary nephrons (15%) have their glomeruli at the cortical-medullary junction of the renal cortex. They have long loops of Henle that descend deep into the medulla. These nephrons are important for the excretion of concentrated urine. The Glomerulus The glomerulus comprises Bowman\\'s capsule and the glomerular tuft. Bowman\\'s capsule is a swelling at the beginning of the nephron. A tuft of highly convoluted capillaries projects into Bowman\\'s capsule - like a fist (glomerular tuft) pushed into a balloon (Bowman\\'s capsule). 2  1 \\nGlomerular filtration occurs in the glomerulus where water and small molecules cross the capillary wall (glomerular filtration barrier) and enter Bowman\\'s space, which is continuous with the proximal tubule. (See Chapter 2). The composition of the glomerular filtrate is changed during passage along the nephron by two processes: 1. Reabsorption of filtered substances from the lumen of the nephron to surrounding capillaries. 2. Secretion of substances from peritubular capillaries into the lumen of the nephron. Figure 1.1. The Nephron. Note the efferent arteriole continues as peritubular capillaries (vasa recta) to supply the downstream nephron and interstitium.  1 3 \\nRENAL CIRCULATION Renal Blood Flow The blood flow to the kidney is enormous (20% of cardiac output), far exceeding that needed for metabolism. The high flow is required for glomerular filtration. Renal Vessels Blood from the renal artery enters interlobar, arcuate and interlobular arteries, and the afferent arteriole to the glomerulus (Figure 1.2). Interlobar artery Renal artery Interlobular artery Arcuate artery Figure 1.2. Renal blood vessels. Renal arterial circulation labeled with venous circulation in parallel. Afferent and Efferent Arteriole. Blood in the afferent arteriole passes to the glomerulus where a portion of the plasma (about 20%) is filtered into the Bowman\\'s space. That portion which escapes filtration leaves the glomerulus via the efferent arteriole. The efferent arteriole soon subdivides to peritubular capillaries, which are closely associated with downstream portions of the nephron and provide a route for the reabsorption of glomerular filtrate and for secretion of substances into the nephron lumen. The peritubular capillaries form the vasa recta. Vasa Recta. Peritubular capillaries give rise to the descending vasa recta (Figure 1.1). These descend parallel to the loop of Henle deep into the medulla. Here they form a capillary plexus supplying the loop of Henle which coalesces into ascending vasa recta, which then drain into the renal veins. The vasa recta supply the medulla with blood and remove some of the reabsorbed substances, yet do so without disrupting the hyperosmolality of the medulla generated by the loop of Henle. 4  1 \\nSEGMENTS OF THE RENAL TUBULE The renal tubule can be divided into four segments: the proximal tubule, the descending and ascending loop of Henle, the distal tubule, and the collecting duct. Each segment contains distinct transporters, allowing for the absorption and secretion of specific ions and molecules. We will review each segment in detail below. Proximal Tubule The proximal tubule is initially convoluted and then straight (S3 segment). It is lined with a columnar epithelium with a very prominent brush border (increased surface area) that projects into the lumen, and contains numerous mitochondria, providing energy for active transport (Figure 1.3). The proximal tubule is the main site of tubular fluid reabsorption. It is also an important site for secretion of substances from peritubular capillaries into the tubular lumen. BB BB b a Figure 1.3. Proximal Tubule Histology. a) Light microscopy of proximal tubule cross-section showing prominent brush border (BB). b) Electron microscopy of proximal tubule cells. The brush border is composed of densely packed microvilli that increase absorptive surface area. Major Processes in the Proximal Tubule: 1. Reabsorption of: - (80-90%) Na+ (65%) and water (65%) HCO3 Other ions: K+ (65%); Ca2+ (80%); Cl- (55%); PO4 3- (90%); Mg2+ (20%); Glucose (100%); uric acid (90%) (note Mg2+ is mostly reabsorbed in loop of Henle.)  1 5 \\n2.

Overview of proximal tubule transport physiology. Transport Physiology. Proximal tubular cells contain four main transporters which work in tandem to drive the absorption of Na+, K+, Cl-, HCO3-, and glucose. Additionally, Na+ and Cl- are absorbed paracellularly in this segment (Figure 1.4). 1. Na+/K+ ATPase. Located on the basolateral side of proximal tubule cells, this pump generates a gradient that is used to reabsorb Na+ from the tubule lumen. 2. Na/glucose symporter. All filtered glucose is absorbed in the proximal tubule. 6  1 \\n3. Na+/H+ antiporter (NHE3). Sodium absorption is further coupled to H+ secretion. Secreted hydrogen ion combines with luminal bicarbonate, forming H2CO3. From H2CO3, carbonic anhydrase (IV) enzyme produces H2O and CO2, and CO2 diffuses freely into the cell. Recombination of CO2 with H2O by the action of carbonic anhydrase (II) produces bicarbonate inside proximal tubular cells. 4. NBC1 cotransporter. Bicarbonate is reabsorbed into the blood with Na+ by the basolateral NBC1 cotransporter. Fanconi Syndrome. Proximal tubular damage or dysfunction, leads impaired reabsorption of sodium-co-transported entities: Renal tubular acidosis (proximal), with hypokalemia Glucosuria Hypophosphatemia (may lead to osteomalacia / rickets / growth failure) Hypouricemia Aminoaciduria There are two large categories for causes of Fanconi syndrome: Hereditary: In children, Fanconi syndrome is most often due to inherited tubular disorders (eg cystinosis). Acquired: In adults, the most common cause is myeloma. Other causes include heavy metal poisoning (e.g., lead or cadmium) and drugs (eg tenofovir, a medicine used to treat HIV). Loop of Henle The loop of Henle (LOH) is made up of the descending limb, ascending limb, and thick ascending limb, and is a major site of electrolyte and water reabsorption. The thick ascending limb is lined with cuboidal epithelial cells with many mitochondria to power Na+ reabsorption (Figure 1.5).  1 7 \\nThin LOH Collecting duct Thick LOH Figure 1.5. Medulla Histology. This section of medulla shows three main types of tubules. Thin and thick loops of Henle (LOH) can be identified by their smaller cross-section and their flat (thin LOH) or cuboidal epithelial lining (thick LOH). Collecting ducts generally have a larger cross-section and are lined by cuboidal epithelial cells. Collecting ducts are more prominent in the deep medulla, close to the renal pelvis (see Figure 1.10). Major Processes in the Loop of Henle: 1. Reabsorption of Na+ (25%) and water (25%) HCO3 (10%) Others: K+ (25%); Ca2+ (20%); Mg2+ (70%) 2. Countercurrent mechanism: sets up medullary concentration gradient to allow concentration of urine (water reabsorption). 8  1 \\n Lumen (Urine) Ascending Loop of Henle Peritubular Capillary (Blood) 3Na+ ATPase 2K+ K+ Cl- NKCC Na+ K+ 2Cl- H2O ROMK K+ paracellular transport Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ Figure 1.6. Overview of loop of Henle transport physiology. Transport Physiology. Loop of Henle cells contain three main transporters which work in tandem to drive the absorption/secretion of Na+, K+, Cl-, and H2O (Figure 1.6). Additionally, Na,+ Ca2+, and most notably Mg2+ are absorbed paracellularly in this segment. 1. Na+/K+ ATPase. Like in the proximal tubule, the basolateral ATPase on the apical creates a sodium gradient, facilitating the absorption of Na+ side of the cell by the NKCC co-transporter. 2. NKCC cotransporter. Roughly 25% of filtered sodium and 25% of filtered K are absorbed in the loop of Henle by this cotransporter. This cotransporter is blocked by loop diuretics. 3. ROMK channel. Some of the potassium that is reabsorbed by NKCC is recycled back into the lumen via the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel, setting up a luminal positive charge which drives paracellular reabsorption of Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+.  1 9 \\n Bartter Syndrome. This is due to an autosomal recessive hereditary defect in the NKCC cotransporter, producing a clinical disorder mimicking chronic ingestion of a loop diuretic: Hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis Polyuria, polydipsia, & a decreased concentrating ability Hypercalciuria Bartter syndrome typically presents prenatally or neonatally, and can be associated with growth retardation. Countercurrent mechanism The interstitium surrounding the loop of Henle is made hyperosmotic to plasma by the reabsorption of sodium chloride (from the loop of Henle) and urea (from the medullary collecting duct). Figure 1.7. Countercurrent mechanism. Absorption of NaCl in the ascending LOH and urea in the medullary collecting duct sets up a medullary concentration gradient, which is the driving force for water absorption in the nephron. The loop of Henle is shaped like a hairpin, with the descending and ascending loops as countercurrent limbs (Figure 1.7). 10  1 \\n ions are absorbed into the The ascending loop is impermeable to H2O, but Na+ outer medullary interstitium via the actions of the NKCC cotransporter. Water is consequently absorbed into the outer medullary interstitium in the descending loop of Henle, which is permeable to water. Delivery of the resulting concentrated tubular fluid to the ascending loop of Henle further drives the absorption of Na+ into the medullary interstitium. The phenomenon is referred to as the countercurrent multiplier. The absorption of Na+, coupled with the absorption of urea from the medullary collecting duct, results in a highly concentrated inner medulla. As a result of this process, the osmolality increases from 300 mOsm/kg in the cortex to a maximum of 1200 mOsm/kg in the inner medulla. This concentration gradient is crucial for the absorption of water in the medullary collecting duct in response to anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH increases the water permeability of the medullary collecting duct, and water follows the osmotic gradient into the medullary interstitium (see \"Medullary Collecting Duct\"). Distal Convoluted Tubule The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule. Although most of the filtered water and solutes are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct are responsible for the \"fine tuning\" of the final composition of the tubular fluid. Distal tubule Proximal tubule Figure 1.8. Distal tubule histology. The distal tubular cells are cuboidal in shape compared to the taller/columnar proximal tubular cells. Also, the distal tubule does not have a brush border.  1 11 \\nMajor Processes in the Distal Nephron 1.

Overview of distal tubule transport physiology. Transport Physiology. Cells of the distal tubule contain three transporters which work in tandem to drive the absorption of Na+, Cl-, and Ca2+. This portion of the nephron is impermeable to H2O, and the absorption of solutes generates hypotonic (dilute) urine (Figure 1.9). 1. Na+/K+ ATPase. Like in the loop of Henle, the basolateral ATPase creates on the apical side of the a sodium gradient, facilitating the absorption of Na+ cell by the Na+/Cl- cotransporter. 2. Na+/Cl- cotransporter.

Binding of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to its receptor in the exchanger, leading to Ca2+ distal tubule increases the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ increased Ca2+ reabsorption. 12  1 \\nGitelman Syndrome. This is due to an autosomal recessive hereditary defect in the Na+/Cl- cotransporter, producing a clinical disorder mimicking chronic ingestion of a thiazide diuretic: Hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis Polyuria & nocturia Hypocalciuria Hypomagnesemia In contrast to Bartter syndrome, Gitelman syndrome is a less severe clinical phenotype, with typical age of diagnosis in late childhood or adulthood. Cortical Collecting Duct The distal tubules from many nephrons unite to form the cortical collecting duct (CCD), which descends through the medulla to the renal pelvis. The collecting ducts are lined with numerous principal cells, which are involved in regulating Na+ and water reabsorption as well as K+ secretion. Less abundant intercalated cells are involved in H+ secretion. a a b b Figure 1.10. Collecting duct histology in the deep medulla/renal pelvis. a) The collecting ducts are lined with simple cuboidal epithelium. b) Histologic cross- section of collecting duct segment.

Overview of cortical collecting duct transport physiology. Transport Physiology. Cells of the collecting contain many transporters which drive the absorption of Na+ and secretion of K+ and H+. This portion of the nephron is sensitive to the hormonal control of aldosterone (Figure 1.11). Principal Cells: 1. Na+/K+ ATPase. The basolateral ATPase creates a sodium gradient, facilitating the absorption of Na+ on the apical side of the cell by the epithelial sodium (ENaC) channel. The binding of aldosterone to its intracellular mineralocorticoid receptor increases expression & insertion of the ATPase on the basolateral membrane, driving Na+ absorption. 2. ENaC channel. This channel facilitates reabsorption of 5% of Na+, generating a negative charge on the tubular lumen to facilitate K+ secretion by renal outer medullary K channel (ROMK) and H+ secretion. ENaC 14  1 \\nexpression & insertion is also upregulated by the binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor. 3. ROMK channel. Secretion of K+ at the collecting duct ROMK channel is indirectly stimulated by aldosterone via ENaC activation. Intercalated cells: 1. H+/K+ ATPase. Some K+ reabsorption by intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct is mediated by this exchanger. 2. H+ ATPase. Reabsorption of Na+ in principal cells imparts a tubular lumen negative charge, which in turn promotes the secretion of H+ in intercalated cells. The H+ is buffered by NH3 (absorbed in the ascending loop of Henle) and is excreted into the urine as NH4Cl. 3. AE1 HCO3-/Cl- exchanger. Carbonic anhydrase activity within intercalated cells generates HCO3 and H+ from H2CO3. Bicarbonate is subsequently reabsorbed by the AE1 exchanger. Liddle Syndrome. This disorder is due to an autosomal dominant gain-of- function mutation in the ENaC channel, leading to increased Na+ the cortical collecting ducts. Patients present with features of hyperaldosteronism, but with nearly undetectable levels of aldosterone. Clinical features include: absorption in Hypertension (excess sodium reabsorption) Hypokalemia with metabolic alkalosis Medullary Collecting Duct The terminal portion of the nephron is called the medullary collecting duct. This portion of the tubule is the major site controlling urine concentration and volume. Urine volumes can range between 500 mL and ~20 L per day, with urine concentration ranging from 50-1200 mOsm/kg. Once the tubular fluid exits the medullary collecting duct and enters the renal pelvis, it is called urine. Major Processes of the Medullary Collecting Duct: 1. Site of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) action to allow H2O reabsorption.  1 15 \\n Hypothalamus Pituitary Gland ADH ADH ADH ADH Lumen (Urine) Medullary Collecting Duct Peritubular Capillary (Blood) AQ2 AQ2 AQ2 aquaporin insertion H2O H2O AQ2 AQ2 V2 Receptor ADH Figure 1.12.

Binding of ADH to the V2 receptor results in a more concentrated urine. in is produced Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) (vasopressin) ADH the hypothalamus, and stored in posterior pituitary. It has a short half-life of 15-20 mins, and is metabolized by liver and kidney. Major actions of ADH: the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of 1. V1 receptor: mediates vasoconstriction in vascular smooth muscle. 2. V2 receptor: mediates water reabsorption via aquaporin insertion (Figure 1.12). The result is the passage of a concentrated urine. Stimulation of ADH secretion is due to: 1. Hyperosmolality. Plasma osmolality >280 mOsm/kg detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus stimulates ADH secretion (up to 12 pg/mL). 2. Hypovolemia. Decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) sensed by carotid baroreceptors leads to a marked increase in ADH (up to 50 pg/mL). 3. Other physiological causes. Includes stress, nausea, pain, or post- operative status. 16  1 \\nTransport Physiology. Cells of the medullary collecting duct contain V2 receptors, which are responsive to ADH secreted by the pituitary gland. The major transporters of this region of the nephron are aquaporins (Figure 1.12). 1. Aquaporins. Aquaporins are inserted on the luminal membrane in response to binding of ADH to the V2 receptor. ADH therefore controls reabsorption of H2O in the medullary collecting duct. Water absorption is driven by the high osmolality of the inner medulla. Distal tubular dysfunction may present with the following abnormalities: Polyuria. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus 2nd to loss of concentrating ability (impaired medullary concentration gradient or ADH resistance) Hypokalemia Renal tubular acidosis (distal) Hypomagnesemia. Anemia (loss of erythropoietin from interstitial fibroblasts) OVERALL VIEW Renal Handling of Sodium Very large amounts of Na+ are filtered each day at the glomerulus, but ~99% of this is reabsorbed by the tubules (Figures 1.4-1.11). Absorption is controlled predominantly by the renin angiotensin system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and natriuretic peptides (discussed further in Chapter 2). To remain in balance, the amount of sodium ingested each day must be excreted. Although there are small amounts in stool and sweat, in normal circumstances, the majority of sodium is excreted by the kidneys. Excretion of sodium is controlled by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which increases in response to increased extracellular volume (ECV). An increased GFR leads to greater Na+ excretion (discussed further in Chapter 2). Renal Handling of Water The kidneys excrete between 500 mL and 20L of urine per day whilst maintaining excretion of the required daily solute load (Na+, K+ and urea). Urine volume is determined predominantly by anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), in the setting of a medullary concentration gradient which has been set up by the countercurrent mechanism. Dilute urine: A dilute urine is the default state in the absence of ADH.The urine is progressively diluted by the absorption of NaCl in the loop of Henle and the distal tubule. The minimum urine concentration is ~ 50mOsm/kg. Therefore, with a typical  1 17 \\ndaily solute intake of ~600mOsms, the maximum urine output would be 12L (or greater with a greater solute intake). Concentrated urine: This is produced in response to ADH.In settings of hyperosmolality or hypovolemia, ADH is stimulated, and water is reabsorbed into the medullary interstitium and is returned to the circulation via the vasa recta. With a maximum urine concentration of 1200mOsm/kg, the daily solute load (600 mOsms) can be excreted in as little as 500 mLs of urine. Oliguria is therefore defined as <500 mLs of urine/day. Renal Handling of Potassium The kidney is responsible for potassium regulation. Serum potassium is filtered at the glomerulus and subsequently absorbed at the proximal tubule (Figure 1.4) and the loop of Henle (Figure 1.6). Potassium secretion occurs in the principal cells of the collecting duct (Figure 1.11). Under normal circumstances, the kidney can lower renal excretion of K+ to 5-10 mmol per day or raise excretion to 450 mmol per day depending on intake. The Kidneys and Acid-Base Balance The kidneys and the lungs work in tandem to control acid-base balance. When an acid load is buffered by HCO3 , CO2 is generated and excreted by alveolar ventilation. Unless the bicarbonate is regenerated by the kidneys, this buffer will rapidly become depleted. Bicarbonate is reclaimed in the nephron at the proximal tubule (Figure 1.4) as well as the cortical collecting duct (Figure 1.11). Excretion of H+ ion in the form of NH4Cl at the cortical collecting duct also maintains acid-base balance. - 18  1 \\nChapter 2 Glomerular Physiology Authors: Haya Jamali & Ashley Jefferson OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: 1.

GLOMERULAR ANATOMY Each kidney contains ~ 1 million nephrons each consisting of a glomerulus, renal tubule, and collecting duct which drains into the renal pelvis. Glomerulus The glomerulus is a tuft of capillary loops enclosed in a pouch-like extension of the renal tubule (Bowman\\'s capsule). Uniquely, the glomerular capillary has an arteriole at both ends. The afferent arteriole enters the glomerulus and immediately divides into 2-5 primary capillary branches, each of which gives rise to a small capillary network (glomerular tuft). These capillaries then converge to form the efferent arteriole, which leaves the glomerulus and continues as the peritubular capillaries and vasa recta.  2 1 \\na b Figure 2.1. Glomerular anatomy. a) The glomerulus consists of glomerular tuft inside Bowman\\'s capsule. b) Glomerulus in cross section, with an afferent arteriole, glomerular capillaries, and an efferent arteriole. Glomerular Capillary Glomerular capillaries consist of a tube of endothelial cells supported by the glomerular basement membrane with podocytes on the outer surface. Glomerular filtration occurs across this capillary wall, known as the filtration barrier, into Bowman\\'s space. Bowman\\'s capsule itself is not in contact with the glomerular capillaries and is not part of the filtration barrier. It is instead lined with a simple flattened epithelium (parietal epithelial cells). The glomerular filtration barrier comprises 3 layers (Figure 2.2): 1. Glomerular capillary ENdothelium fenestrated endothelium is comprised of a single thin layer of flattened endothelial cells with large gaps (fenestrae) between them, 100 nm in diameter.

Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM): The endothelium rests on a basement membrane, a negatively charged mesh of type IV collagen, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides, which are secreted by the podocyte and endothelial cell. The basement membrane provides structural support to the capillary loops. 3. Visceral epithelium (podocytes): Podocytes project tentacle-like foot processes onto the basement membrane. Between the foot processes lie filtration slits, which are connected by slit diaphragms, composed of proteins (eg nephrin) limiting filtration of larger molecules. 2  2 \\nFigure 2.2: Glomerular filtration barrier.

Glomerular Filtration Barrier  2 3 \\nThe filtration barrier is freely permeable to molecules with a MW < 7K, such as water, electrolytes, amino acids, and glucose. If a substance is freely filtered, its concentration in the tubular fluid of Bowman\\'s space equals its concentration in plasma (TF/P = 1). By contrast, the filtration barrier is relatively impermeable to large molecules such as plasma proteins. Proteins with a MW > 70K are totally excluded (TP/P = 0). If ions are bound to proteins, they too will be excluded (eg 40% plasma Ca2+ is protein-bound). Between these extremes there is \"sieving\" of plasma solutes depending on their charge and size (Figure 2.4). water (18) glucose (180) insulin (5K) myoglobin (18K) Substance (MW) hemoglobin (68K) albumin (69K) 20 40 1 0.5 o i t a r a m s a l p / e t a r t l i F 0 0 Molecular Radius (A) Figure 2.4. TF/P ratio for molecules of different sizes. Water, ions, and small molecules are freely filtered into Bowman\\'s space. Large proteins such as hemoglobin and albumin are largely excluded. GLOMERULAR FILTRATION Glomerular filtration is the ultrafiltration of certain plasma components from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman\\'s space. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is dependent on renal blood flow (RBF). RBF accounts for 20% of total cardiac output, which far exceeds that required for metabolic needs. GFR at the level of the nephron is described by the Starling Equation: Single Nephron GFR (SNGFR) = Kf ([PGC - PBS] - [πGC - πBS]) or Kf (Δp-Δπ) where Kf = filtration coefficient, PGC and PBS = hydrostatic pressures, and πGC and πBS = osmotic pressures. The filtration coefficient (Kf) is defined as the product of hydraulic permeability and surface area. These factors drive glomerular filtration into the Bowman\\'s space: 4  2 \\n1. Hydraulic Permeability. As discussed above, the glomerular filtration barrier is freely permeable to water. The large magnitude of GFR is largely due to this high hydraulic permeability: while other capillaries in the body only filter ~4L /day combined, the glomerular capillaries filter ~180 L/day. 2. Surface Area. Filtration is directly proportional to the available capillary surface area. In the glomerulus, this surface area is large, due to the tortuous nature of the glomerular capillaries. Net filtration pressure (NFP), defined as Δp-Δπ,is the sum of Starling forces, which govern the movement of fluids across any capillary bed. Two forces favor filtration from glomerular to Bowman\\'s space: 1. Hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary (PGC). This is the main force driving filtration. It is ~60 mm Hg at the afferent end of the glomerular capillaries (markedly higher than other capillary beds) and declines minimally to ~58 mm Hg at the efferent end. PGC is neurohormonally regulated and is thus the most closely controlled determinant of GFR.It depends on pressure in the renal artery, afferent arteriole resistance and efferent arteriole resistance. 2. Oncotic pressure of fluid in Bowman\\'s space (PBS). Oncotic pressure is the osmotic pressure generated by colloids, principally albumin. Water flows to regions of high oncotic pressure. The glomerular filtrate is essentially protein free, so PBS ~ 0 mm Hg. Two forces oppose filtration: 3. Hydrostatic pressure in the Bowman\\'s space (PBS). PBS is ~15 mm Hg. This provides the driving pressure for flow of fluid down the nephron. PBS is not controlled physiologically, but can increase if tubular flow is obstructed [eg kidney stone]. Increased PBS reduces net filtration pressure and decreases GFR. 4. Oncotic pressure of plasma in the glomerular capillary (PGC). PGC is the main force opposing filtration. It is 21 mm Hg at the afferent end of the capillaries, but increases to ~33 mm Hg at the efferent end as protein-free fluid is removed from the capillaries by filtration (ie the glomerular capillary plasma becomes more concentrated along its length). Shaded area represents net filtration pressure which decreases along glomerular capillary mostly due to an increase in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (PGC).\\nRenal plasma flow (RPF) is the most important determinant of GFR.The RPF determines the rate at which the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries (which opposes glomerular filtration) increases along its length. RPF has less effect on glomerular hydrostatic pressure due to autoregulation (see below). Normally, oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillaries increases as proteins become concentrated due to the filtration of fluid along glomerular capillary (from 21 to 33 mm Hg). In states of low RPF, relatively more fluid is removed from the glomerular capillary and the oncotic pressure rises halting glomerular filtration before the end of the glomerular capillary (ie filtration equilibrium). By contrast, with higher RPF, there is relatively less fluid removed, a smaller increase in glomerular capillary oncotic pressure (PGC), and filtration continues along the full length of the glomerular capillary increasing overall GFR.The major factor affecting renal plasma flow is blood pressure. RENAL AUTOREGULATION The ability of the nephron to maintain RBF and GFR fairly steady over a range of systolic pressures from 90 to 200 mm Hg is known as autoregulation. Autoregulation permits adequate excretion of water and solute at different blood pressures, but note that this protective process is impaired at extremes of blood pressure and during acute kidney injury. Figure 2.7. Renal autoregulation. RBF and GFR are maintained over a range of systolic pressures between 90 and 200 mm Hg.  2 7 \\nRenal autoregulation is mediated primarily by changes in the resistance of the afferent arteriole. The mechanisms of autoregulation include: 1. Myogenic reflex. An increase in perfusion pressure stretches muscle in the afferent arterioles. In response to stretch, smooth muscle contracts in and the arterioles constrict, increasing vascular resistance (and therefore decreasing PGC). This phenomenon is very rapid and is also observed in other vascular beds. 2. Tubuloglomerular feedback. Increased arterial pressure leading to an increase in PGC results in increased delivery of chloride to the macula densa. As a result, the afferent arteriole constricts, reducing GFR.This mechanism is mediated by the juxtaglomerular apparatus. JUXTAGLOMERULAR APPARATUS The junction of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule lies between the afferent and efferent arterioles of its parent glomerulus (Figure 2.8). At this site, the epithelial cells of the tubule wall become thickened to form a small plaque, the macula densa. The macula densa is in close contact with specialized smooth muscle cells in the wall of the afferent arteriole, called granular cells. Together the macula densa and the granular cells form the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). The JGA is important in the control of glomerular filtration and the regulation of systemic blood volume and pressure. The macula densa senses the composition of tubular fluid and the granular cells mediate changes to GFR.proximal tubule podocytes Bowman\\'s space glomerular capillaries mesangial cells (surrounded by matrix) efferent arteriole efferent arteriole endothelial cells afferent arteriole granular cells macula densa (distal tubule) JGA apparatus Figure 2.8: Juxtaglomerular apparatus. The macula densa of the distal tubule consists of thickened epithelial cells adjacent to the afferent arteriole. These cells sense the NaCl concentration of tubular fluid and transmit this information to the granular cells. 8  2 \\nJGA control of GFR Luminal chloride is sensed by Na+/K+/2Cl- (NKCC) co-transporters in the macula densa cells. In response, the juxtaglomerular apparatus modifies GFR by two opposing mechanisms (Figure 2.9): 1. High Cl- delivery to the macula densa. This occurs with injury to proximal tubular cells leading to failure to reabsorb NaCl proximally. In this setting, adenosine is released which signals vasoconstriction of the afferent arteriole which decreases is called tubuloglomerular feedback. The decrease in GFR actually protects the nephron from further injury. the GFR.This process Note: Glomerulotubular balance is a separate phenomenon where variations in GFR are compensated by increased or decreased reabsorption in the tubules (mostly proximal) to produce same amount of urine (ie a reduction in GFR from 125mls/min to 60 mls/min still leads to ~2L urine / day.) 2. Low Cl- delivery to the macula densa. In settings of impaired renal perfusion (eg low blood pressure), more NaCl is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. The resulting low luminal chloride at the macula densa leads to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production which signals the granular cells to produce renin. The release of renin results in RAAS activation (see below) to maintain blood pressure. Note that NSAID use blocks the production of PGE2, inhibiting renin production. Additionally, the use of loop diuretics directly blocks the NKCC, leading to increased renin production. in the macula densa Figure 2.9. Functions of the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Cl- sensing by NKCC co-transporters to modification of GFR by tubuloglomerular feedback (left) or renin release (right).  2 leads 9 \\nNEUROHORMONAL CONTROL OF RBF AND GFR RBF and GFR are additionally controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), secretion of natriuretic peptides, sympathetic nervous system, and prostaglandin secretion. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) The RAAS is a major regulator of GFR and is activated by a number of mechanisms: 1. Macula densa. As described previously, low Cl- sensed in the macula densa stimulates the RAAS.2. Intrarenal baroreceptors. The granular cells of the JGA contain stretch receptors that monitor the pressure of the renal arteries. A fall in blood pressure in the afferent arteriole reduces stretch and simulates the RAAS.3. Renal sympathetic nerves. In response to a drop in arterial pressure, systemic vascular baroreceptors increase the sympathetic tone to the kidney, stimulating the RAAS.Each of these pathways leads to the secretion of the enzyme renin by the granular cells of the JGA (Figure 2.10). Renin catalyzes the conversion of Angiotensinogen in the blood (synthesized by the liver) to angiotensin I, a 10 amino acid peptide. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), an enzyme found in the lung, clips two amino acids from angiotensin I to form angiotensin II, which directly regulates GFR.Angiotensin II additionally stimulates aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex as well as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary gland. RAAS Activation: NaCl delivery to macula densa Low ECV SNS stimulation Angiotensinogen renin Angiotensin I ACE stimulates NHE3 increased Na+ reabsorption Angiotensin II: constricts efferent arteriole GFR increased Aldosterone from the adrenal cortex ADH from the pituitary gland Angiotensin II Aldosterone: stimulates ENaC stimulates Na/K ATPase increased Na+ reabsorption ADH (Vasopressin): increased H2O reabsorption Figure 2.10. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. RAAS activation leads to the production of angiotensin II, aldosterone, and ADH, which act directly on the nephron. 10  2 \\nAngiotensin II has a wide range of effects related to the regulation of GFR, blood pressure and blood volume: 1. Vasoconstriction. Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor of arterioles throughout the body, increasing peripheral resistance and blood pressure. In the kidney, the afferent, and especially the efferent arterioles, are constricted which reduces renal blood flow (RBF). Greater efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction increases pressure in glomerular capillary (PGC) leading to a relative increase in GFR.2. Increased sodium reabsorption. Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, leading to increased Na reabsorption in the cortical collecting duct. Additionally, angiotensin II directly stimulates Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule via NHE3 stimulation. 3. Increased water reabsorption. Angiotensin II stimulates ADH secretion, leading to increased water absorption in the medullary collecting duct. Angiotensin II also stimulates thirst. Natriuretic Peptides Natriuretic peptides oppose the RAAS system, acting at times of volume expansion to increase Na+ excretion. 1. Atrial natriuretic peptide. ANP is produced in response to atrial stretch and acts to inhibit renin and angiotensin II.As a result, GFR increases. 2. Brain natriuretic peptide. BNP is produced predominantly in the ventricles in response to stretch and acts at ANP receptors, though with 10-fold lower affinity. BNP is widely used clinically as a marker of heart failure. Sympathetic Nervous System At rest, the sympathetic tone to the kidney is low. A fall in blood pressure stimulates the SNS through baroreceptors in aortic arch, carotid sinus, heart, and large veins. The release of norepinephrine leads to alpha1 activation of arteriolar muscle, causing afferent vasoconstriction. In response to severe hypotension, autoregulation is overridden by systemic control mechanisms. Higher levels of levels of angiotensin II act to constrict both the afferent and efferent arteriole, reducing GFR to minimize loss of salt and water. Vasoconstriction in the arterioles diverts blood from the kidney to more essential organs (heart and brain). Prostaglandin Secretion Both sympathetic stimulation and angiotensin induce synthesis of prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) by the kidney. These are powerful vasodilators, especially of the afferent arteriole, where they oppose the renal vasoconstriction  2 11 II \\nmediated by sympathetic nerves and angiotensin II.The use of NSAIDs to block prostaglandins results in unopposed constriction of both afferent and efferent arterioles, leading to a dramatic drop in both RBF and GFR.NSAIDs (GFR decreased) Natriuretic Peptides (ANP & BNP) dilates afferent arteriole inhibits RAAS system GFR increased PGE2: dilates afferent arteriole GFR increased Angiotensin II: constricts efferent arteriole GFR increased ACE-I (GFR decreased) Figure 2.11. Neurohormonal Control of GFR at the Glomerulus. Natriuretic peptides, PGE2, and angiotensin II act on the glomerulus to increase GFR.The use of NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors in the setting of impaired renal perfusion may block these protective mechanisms, leading to a drop in RBF/GFR and acute kidney injury. Other A range of other vasoactive substances may cause constriction (eg adenosine) or dilation (eg nitric oxide, histamine, bradykinin) of the afferent arteriole. 12  2 \\nChapter 3 Measurement of Kidney Function Author: Haya Jamali & Ashley Jefferson OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: 1. Understand the principles and applications of clearance. 2. Given data, calculate the creatinine clearance, renal blood flow, and fractional excretion of a substance. 3. Predict whether a substance undergoes net reabsorption or net secretion by comparing its clearance with that of inulin or by comparing its rate of filtration with its rate of excretion. 4. Use plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate. 5. Estimate glomerular filtration rate from clearance of creatinine (CCr), and describe the limitations of this method. 6. Recognize equations used to estimate GFR and understand their limitations. AssEssMENT OF KIDNEY FUNCTION The accurate assessment of kidney function is critical for appropriate patient care. The measurement of kidney function allows one to: Identify acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease (even in the absence of symptoms) Dose medications appropriately Monitor the progression of chronic kidney disease Recognize and treat the complications of kidney disease Identify patients at higher risk for procedures Various measures are used to describe renal physiology. It is important to understand the use of the terms glomerular filtration rate, urinary excretion, renal blood flow, renal plasma flow, filtration fraction, fractional excretion and clearance. Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) The kidney performs multiple functions, but the term \"kidney function\" mainly refers to glomerular filtration rate (GFR). GFR is a reflection of how well the kidney is filtering (and subsequently excreting) substances.  3 1 \\nThe GFR is equal to the sum of the filtration rates in all functioning nephrons. The typical value for GFR in young males is approximately 125 mL/min (=180 L/day). This value declines with age, is lower in females on average, and is lower with smaller body size. Note: urinary excretion is not the same as glomerular filtration. The glomerular filtrate (~180 L/d) is altered by tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion such the final urine averages ~1.5 L/day.

Excretion 1 2 3 4 Peritubular capillaries Renal vein Urinary excretion Excretion = Filtration - Reabsorption + Secretion Figure 3.1. Urinary Excretion. Total urinary excretion reflects glomerular filtration modified by reabsorption and secretion. Average urinary excretion averages 1.5 L/day. Example 1. Inulin is a substance freely filtered at the nephron that is neither reabsorbed nor secreted, meaning all filtered inulin is excreted in the urine. Two patients are given identical infusions of inulin. Patient A is a healthy young adult, whereas Patient B has severely reduced kidney function. Four hours after the infusion, which of these patients will have higher serum inulin? Answer: Patient B has reduced kidney function, indicating a reduced GFR.The filtration rate of inulin will be markedly reduced, therefore serum inulin will be elevated relative to that of Patient A.2  3 \\n Renal Blood Flow (RBF) Renal blood flow is defined as the volume of blood delivered to the kidneys per unit time. Normal RBF is 20-25% of cardiac output. For an average individual at rest, cardiac output ~ 6.0 L/min; RBF is therefore ~ 1.2 L/min. Renal Plasma Flow (RPF) Renal plasma flow is defined as the volume of plasma delivered to the kidney per unit time. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood that does not include RBCs, WBCs, or platelets. Where Hct is the hematocrit. RPF can be estimated by measurement of the clearance of para-aminohippuric acid (see below). Example 2. A patient with hypertension starts an ACE inhibitor. Is their GFR increased, decreased, or unchanged? What about RBF? Answer: As you may recall from Chapter 2, the RAAS system acts to constrict the efferent arteriole preferentially. Therefore, administration of an ACE inhibitor leads to efferent arteriolar vasodilation. This has the effect of decreasing GFR (via reduction of hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillaries) as well as increasing RBF (decreased overall resistance). Example 3. A patient\\'s RPF is measured to be 720 mL/min with a hematocrit of 42%. What is this patient\\'s renal blood flow? What portion of the cardiac output flows to this patient\\'s kidneys? Is this within normal range? This is normal. Filtration fraction is defined as the ratio of glomerular filtration rate to renal plasma flow: FF represents the fraction of plasma volume that is filtered at the glomeruli into the Bowman\\'s space. Normally, this value is ~ 20%. Fractional Excretion (FE) - The percentage of a particular filtered substance that is excreted in the urine in called the fractional excretion. For a substance that is filtered and neither secreted nor reabsorbed (eg inulin), the FE would be 100%. If a substance is filtered, but then completely reabsorbed (eg glucose), the FE = 0%. If a substance that is filtered and secreted by the proximal tubule (eg creatinine), FE > 100%. Given a normal GFR of 125 mL/min, total daily glomerular filtrate is ~180 L/day. However, significant reabsorption of water occurs in the nephron, and urinary excretion amounts to only ~1.5 L/day. What is the fractional excretion of water? The fractional excretion of water is 1.5 L/ 180L, or 0.8%. Amount filtered per 24 hrs 180 L 180 L x 140 mmol/L=25200mmol 180 L x 4 mmol/L = 720 mmol 180 L x 0.8 mg/dL = 1440 mg 180 L x 12 mg/dL = 21,600 mg 180 L x 100 mg/dL Table 3.1. Fractional excretion of a variety of substances1 Amount Substance excreted Water 1.5 L 150 Sodium 70 Potassium Creatinine 1,600 11,000 Urea Glucose 0 1Note these are average values and vary from person to person depending on sex, age, size and diet. Average plasma concentration of Na+ (140 mmol/L), K+ (4 mmol/L), creatinine (0.8 mg/dL), urea (12 mg/dL), and glucose (100 mg/dL). Clearance represents a theoretical volume of plasma cleared of a substance per unit time. (In reality, there is no aliquot of plasma that is completed cleared of a substance as it passes through the kidney). Where Ux = urine concentration of x (mg/mL), Px = plasma concentration of x (mg/mL), and V = urine flow rate (mL/time). Note that clinically, a total urine volume over 24 hours (\"urine output\") is usually given. A patient is infused with sulbenicillin, a broad spectrum antibiotic, at a constant rate to reach a steady-state serum concentration of 0.035 mg/mL.Urine production is 1.5 mL/min with a urine sulbenicillin concentration of 5.0 mg/mL.What is the clearance of sulbenicillin? Notes that units of clearance are always volume per unit time. In this example, the urine flow rate is given in mLs/min, whereas more commonly a total urine volume (over 24 hours) is given [24 hours = 1440 min]. (see example Clearance is dependent on glomerular filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and metabolism and therefore varies significantly between substances. (For example, albumin is not filtered at the glomerulus and has a clearance of zero.) A substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus, is neither secreted nor reabsorbed, and is not changed during excretion can be used to measure GFR. In addition, a substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus and additionally secreted completely can be used to measure RPF. Inulin is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is not secreted, absorbed, nor metabolized. Inulin clearance therefore represents the gold standard for measurement of GFR. The measurement of GFR via inulin clearance requires a constant infusion of inulin (through an intravenous catheter) at a rate sufficient to maintain a steady state plasma concentration, frequent blood tests, and accurate collection of urine (usually with a catheter inserted in the bladder). Measuring GFR via inulin clearance is complex & expensive, and only used as a research tool. In clinical practice we usually use creatinine clearance (below) or if we need a more accurate measure (rarely) we can use iothalamate clearance. Iothalamate has similar characteristics to inulin and is an accurate way of measuring GFR.It requires an injection of the radionucleotide iothalamate and then serial blood or urine collections. Example 6. The patient in example 7 had a sulbenicillin clearance of 210 mL/min. His GFR is measured by inulin clearance on the same day and was found to be 125 mL/min. What does this tell us about the filtration and tubular handling of sulbenicillin? Answer: Inulin is freely filtered at the glomerulus, not reabsorbed or secreted, and inulin clearance equals GFR.The clearance of sulbenicillin is greater than GFR, therefore sulbenicillin must be secreted by the nephron (in this case, by the proximal tubule) [the filtration of inulin and sulbenicillin is the same, cannot be higher]. In contrast, note that a substance with a lower clearance than GFR must be either filtered less freely at the glomerulus (eg large size, protein bound) or reabsorbed by the nephron (eg Na+). 2. Clearance to measure renal plasma flow Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is freely filtered, but in addition, is nearly totally secreted into the proximal tubule. In this setting, the total amount of PAH delivered to the kidney (RPF x P) is equal to the amount of PAH excreted in the urine (UV). PAH clearance therefore can be used to estimate RPF. In clinical practice we can assess renal function (GFR) in 3 ways: serum creatinine (estimate) or BUN (less accurate estimate), creatinine clearance (calculate) or empirically derived equations (estimates). Using Serum Creatinine to Estimate GFR Creatinine is an amino acid derivative (113 Da) derived from the metabolism of creatine in skeletal muscle (also from dietary meat intake). It is released into the circulation and excreted by the kidneys at a relatively constant rate; it therefore has a stable plasma concentration when the patient is in steady state. The kidneys excrete creatinine mostly by filtration, though there is a small contribution from secretion in the proximal tubule (~10% of total excretion). Therefore, creatinine clearance serves as a reasonable estimate of GFR (slightly over-estimates). In steady state, the amount of creatinine excreted is constant. Since excretion is equivalent to urine Cr concentration x urine flow rate: and therefore, the GFR varies inversely with the plasma creatinine concentration (PCr). This relationship between GFR and PCr is used in clinical practice to estimate the GFR.As the kidney function (GFR) falls, the serum creatinine climbs. For example, if a patient has a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL (normal = 0.8-1.2 mg/dL), the patient\\'s GFR is roughly half of the normal value. Note: creatinine production depends on muscle mass, and the use of serum creatinine to estimate GFR is less accurate at extremes of muscle mass. If the patient has very little muscle (wasted, elderly, amputation etc.), creatinine production is low, and the baseline serum creatinine may be as low as 0.5 mg/dL.An increase in creatinine to 2.0 mg/dL for this patient might signify that the GFR is actually 25% of normal. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) Urea is derived from protein breakdown and is excreted by the kidneys. As renal clearance of urea declines, BUN rises, and BUN can therefore also be used as a measure of renal function. However, the levels of BUN are much more variable than creatinine. In addition to a decrease in GFR, BUN levels may be increased by high protein diet, muscle breakdown, gastrointestinal bleed and volume depletion. BUN is a less accurate estimation of renal function. Two patients may produce different baseline amounts of creatinine. As a result, the same serum creatinine (dashed line) may signify widely different GFRs. Using Creatinine Clearance to estimate GFR As discussed previously, creatinine is filtered by the glomerulus, but is secreted to a small extent by proximal tubular cells. In fact, ~10% of urinary creatinine is derived from tubular secretion. Thus, the creatinine clearance is not a perfect marker for GFR, and tends to slightly overestimate GFR, but this is usually close enough in clinical practice. The creatinine clearance is usually determined from a 24-hour urine collection, because shorter collections tend to be less accurate. There are two major errors that affect the accuracy of the creatinine clearance: 1. Inadequate urine collection. It is difficult to accurately collect urine for 24 hours. The patient must collect ALL the urine, the timing must be accurate, and it must be transported intact to the laboratory. To determine whether the collection is accurate, we estimate daily steady-state creatinine production to be 20-25 mg/kg in males, and 15-20 mg/kg in females, varying by muscle mass. The amount of excretion of creatinine should lie in this range for a 24-hour urine collection. 2. Overestimation of GFR at lower levels of kidney function. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CDK), GFR has declined. As GFR falls, the proportion of creatinine secreted by the proximal tubule increases, accounting for as much as 35% of urinary creatinine excretion, leading to a greater over-estimation of GFR. A 24-year old man who weights 70 kg collects urine for 24 hours to measure his GFR.The amount of creatinine in the jug he brings to the lab is 1136 mg. Is the collection accurate? Answer: Probably not. If he is of average stature, his creatinine excretion should be between 20-25 mg/kg, or 1400-1750 mg of creatinine. The collection jug contained less creatinine. You are busy in the medical student after-hours clinic, and the last two patients you see both have a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL.Patient 1: a 25 year old man (weight 100 kg) Patient 2: a 56 year old woman (weight 50 kg). Since you\\'ve read your renal syllabus, you know to order 24-hour urine collections to measure the GFR using creatinine clearance. Patient 1: Urine volume 2000 mL; urine creatinine 125 mg/dL. Patient 2: Urine volume 2000 mL; urine creatinine 37.6 mg/dL. Do these patients have the same GFR? First, check to see if each patient\\'s 24-hour urine collection is accurate. GFR = C_inulin. These equations to estimate GFR were developed to try and make the interpretation of the serum creatinine easier for patients and providers. For each of these equations, the only actual measurement is the serum creatinine, and using other variables, the equations estimate a GFR.Note this estimated GFR is an average GFR for a population of subjects with the same variables, and is not specific to the subject tested. The following equations are currently used to estimate GFR: 1. MDRD Equation 2. CKD-Epi Equation 3. Cockcroft and Gault 4. Schwarz formula (for children and adolescents) 1. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study Equation. The MDRD equation was the most widely used equation and was previously reported automatically when a serum creatinine level was ordered. Its variables are serum creatinine, age, sex, and race. The MDRD equation was originally developed by regression modeling of serum creatinine concentration, and introduced correction factors for sex and \"black ethnicity\". The subsequent African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) study corroborated this predictive formula in Black American patients. Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL) and age is expressed in years. The MDRD equation has come under scrutiny for its use of race as a variable. The authors of a recent JAMA editorial11 argue that racial categorization is often non- standard, and that the use of the MDRD equation with race coefficient has major clinical consequences that may contribute to racial disparities in specialist referrals, clinical trials, and access to kidney transplantation (see next section). The MDRD equation (or any estimating equation) is not suitable to estimate GFR in: Acute kidney injury (serum creatinine must be in steady state; High levels of renal function (any results above 60 mL/min are reported simply as >60); Extremes of age (children < 18, or age > 75); Extremes of body habitus (obese, very muscular or cachectic); Pregnancy Race, Medicine, and estimating GFR equations. The use of \"race\" in human genetic or biomedical research is inherently problematic as it has been shown that there is no genetic basis for race.3 The use of race may be an inexact proxy for other demographic factors, such as socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry, or level of education.4 In addition, the definition of \"race\" is not standardized across medical journals or US clinical laboratories, leading to the imprecise use of race as a population descriptor.5 In particular, the racial correction factors introduced in the MDRD equation1 and the CDK-EPI equation6 are assigned to patients of \"black ethnicity\"; whereas in the subsequent AASK study,1 the correction factor is instead applied to \"African 3 Serre, D.et al. Evidence for gradients of human genetic diversity within and among continents. It is not clear how these terms were defined during study development. Assigning race to an individual person is difficult, and within each racial category there is a wide range of genetic ancestry. Furthermore, studies of the use of the MDRD equation to estimate GFR in African Europeans7 and Black South Africans8 concluded the \"African-American\" correction factor was not accurate in these populations. The results call into question the utility of the correction factor in a clinical context. The race correction factor in the eGFR equations leads to a higher eGFR in subjects who are categorized as Black which may have deleterious consequences for that individual including delayed referral to nephrology specialists and delayed referral to kidney transplant programs (usually referred when eGFR is < 20mls/min). Moreover, the use of race in clinical decision making is imprecise and evokes the memory of historical traumas perpetuated by the institution of medicine against Black people.9 At the University of Washington and at an increasing number of institutions, the race coefficient has been removed and is not reported. Given the historical context, it is critical to interrogate the ethical propriety of the continued distinctions between White and Black patients in clinical care and biomedical research. Health professions students nationwide are pioneering efforts to understand and dismantle structural racism perpetuated in their training. The CKD-Epi Equation The CKD-Epi equation was developed in an effort to create a more precise formula to estimate GFR with a much larger dataset and is widely replacing the MDRD study. This equation includes the same variables as the MDRD equation. As of July 2020, UW Medicine moved to reporting the eGFR based on the CDK-Epi equation. Notably, the race-based correction factor was removed from the report at UW Medicine, in large part due to UWSOM student advocacy. Students at UWSOM and others11 have argued that the use of a race-based correction factor is scientifically inaccurate and sanctions systemic racism in medicine. For further reading, see: \"Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present\" by Harriet A.Washington (2008). Pcr is plasma creatinine (mg/dL) and body weight is expressed in kg. Age is expressed in years. Note that this equation requires an accurate body weight, which may not always be available. Crucially, weight may not reflect muscle mass (for example in obesity or marked edema). Additionally, this equation actually estimates creatinine clearance, not GFR.4. The Schwartz Formula The Schwartz Formula is used to estimate GFR in children: where k = 0.33 in preemie infants, 0.45 in term infants up to 1 year old, 0.55 in children up to 13 years, 0.55 in adolescent females, and 0.65 in adolescent males. SCr is serum creatinine (mg/dL) and height is reported in centimeters. Future Directions in GFR Estimates: Cystatin C is a non-glycated, basic protein with a molecular weight of 13.3 kDa. It functions as the most important inhibitor of cysteine protease and as such is produced by all nucleated cells at a constant rate. It is freely filtered in the glomerulus, but unlike creatinine, it is reabsorbed and fully catabolized in the proximal tubule. There is no tubular secretion. GFR may be estimated by measuring serum levels of cystatin C.In one study, the inclusion of cystatin C levels into eGFR regression modeling reduced the magnitude of all other coefficients (age, race, and sex) by half and resulted in a more accurate estimation of GFR. At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: Explain the neurohumoral reflexes and mechanisms (hormonal, renal, cardiac, and vascular) that maintain effective arterial blood volume. Determine the extracellular volume from physical exam findings and prescribe appropriate IV fluids. Explain the concept of effective arterial blood volume. Determine the cause of edema from clinical data and describe the underlying pathophysiology. Describe the clinical management of edema. DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL BODY WATER (TBW) TBW comprises 45% to 70% of body weight, depending in large part on the ratio of fat to muscle. The average values for TBW are 50% for females and 60% for males. Older people may have a lower % TBW, as they have lower muscle mass. Body Compartments TBW is divided within the body into two main compartments: 1. Intracellular fluid (ICF); roughly 2/3 of the total body water. 2. Extracellular fluid (ECF); roughly 1/3 of the total body water. As water can move freely across cell membranes, the size of the ICF and ECF is determined by the number of osmotically active particle in each these spaces. There are approximately twice as many osmoles in the ICF (mostly K+ and organic phosphates) compared to the ECF (mostly Na+, Cl-, HCO3- and albumin) and therefore the ICF is twice the size of the ECF.Na+ is maintained predominantly in the ECF by the action of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The ECF is further divided into the interstitial space (75% of the ECF), and the intravascular compartment, or plasma volume (25% of the ECF).  4 1 \\nFigure 4.1. Water distribution in an average male. Values for a 70 kg male are shown in parentheses. REGULATION OF EXTRACELLULAR VOLUME (ECV) The extracellular volume (ECV), which includes the plasma volume, is essential for maintenance of blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Sensing of Extracellular Volume (ECV) Recall that the ECV is sensed by baroreceptors in 3 major areas (see Chapter 2, Figure 4.2): 1. Carotid sinuses and aortic arch baroreceptors: these activate natriuretic peptides and the sympathetic nervous system 2. Atria (and cardiopulmonary circulation): these activate natriuretic peptides 3. Afferent glomerular arterioles: these influence activation of the RAAS system Figure 4.2. Activation of SNS and RAAS by volume depletion. Baroreceptors in the glomerular afferent arteriole and carotid/aortic arch lead to SNS and RAAS activation. 2  4 \\nTotal Body Sodium Control of the ECV is maintained by the regulation of sodium content in the body. Total body sodium is regulated by both sodium intake and sodium excretion: Sodium Intake This depends on diet, and is therefore highly variable. The average sodium intake in the US is ~4g (170mmol) sodium per day (~10g / day salt). Recommended daily NaCl intake - Sodium intake < 2.3g (100mmol) per day Note: In settings of Na excess (eg edema, hypertension), the recommended intake is Na <1.5g (65mmol)/day. Sodium Excretion Small amounts of sodium are excreted in sweat and in stool, but the majority is excreted by the kidney (see Chapter 1, Renal Handling of Sodium) Effective Arterial Blood Volume (EABV) The effective arterial blood volume (EABV) (sometimes called the effective circulating volume), refers to that portion of the plasma volume (part of ECV) that is in the arterial system, and is perfusing the tissues (~700 mL in a 70 kg male). Usually, the EABV varies directly with the ECV and is proportional to total body sodium content. However, sometimes the EABV is not proportional to ECV.This is the case for patients with heart failure and cirrhosis (see Volume Expansion below). DISORDERS OF VOLUME (TOTAL BODY SODIUM) Key Point: ECV is determined largely by the total amount of sodium present in the body, NOT the serum sodium concentration. Increased ECV (volume expansion) and decreased ECV (volume depletion) are common disorders and are diagnosed by history and physical examination. VOLUME DEPLETION Volume depletion (or hypovolemia) occurs when the ECV is reduced, leading to a low blood pressure and decreased tissue perfusion. Causes of volume depletion. Volume depletion occurs due to loss of Na+ (& by extension, H2O) from the body, which shrinks the ECV.Note: water loss alone has a much smaller effect on the ECV as 2/3 of the water loss will be from the ICV.Typical causes include:  4 3 \\n1. Gastro-intestinal losses (diarrhea or vomiting) 2. Excess sweating (sweat Na concentration ~ 40 mmol/L) 3. Renal Na+ losses (eg excess diuretics) Clinical Features. Mild cases may result in dizziness, weakness, and fatigue. In severe ECV depletion there is orthostatic dizziness, syncope and circulatory collapse. On examination, tachycardia and hypotension (or orthostatic hypotension if BP preserved when seated) are the cardinal signs. Cold extremities, dry mucus membranes and loss of skin turgor are less reliable. Physiological Effects. Baroreceptors in the carotid sinuses, aortic arch, and atria sense the volume depletion and activate the SNS and RAAS systems. As a result, angiotensin II activation attempts to increase EABV by exerting effects on Na+ reabsorption (in the proximal tubule, and via aldosterone), water balance (via thirst, ADH), and vasoconstriction (via a1 receptor activation). As a result, total body Na+ is expanded. Treatment. The primary treatment is re-expansion of the ECV with normal saline or balanced salt solutions (eg Lactated Ringers). The underlying cause of the volume depletion must be addressed. VOLUME EXPANSION (EDEMATOUS STATES) Edema is the abnormal accumulation of fluid (salt and water) in the interstitial compartment. Recall that the movement of fluid between plasma volume and interstitium occurs across the capillary wall governed by pressure differences between plasma and interstitial compartments, or Starling Forces. The movement of fluid is described by the following equation: Net Filtration = Kf ([PCap - PInt] - [πCap - πInt]) or Kf (Δp-Δπ) where Kf = filtration coefficient, PCap and PInt = hydrostatic pressures, and πCap and πInt = osmotic pressures. Under normal circumstances and in most tissues, net filtration has a slightly positive value, reflecting filtration out of the intravascular space into the interstitial space. The filtered fluid is returned to the systemic circulation by lymphatic drainage, maintaining a normal interstitial volume. Major causes of edema. Increased net filtration into the interstitium results in edema (Table 4.1). 4  4 \\nThe pathogenesis of the most common causes of edema involves increased renal retention. Sodium excess results in increased size of the ECV.As stated Na+ previously, common etiologies include heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, which are highlighted below. Table 4.1. Major causes of edema Mechanism Pathogenesis Increased capillary wall permeability (Kf) Increased plasma volume from renal Na+ retention Venous obstruction / venous hypertension Decreased pre- arteriolar resistance Protein loss Reduced protein synthesis Lymphatic obstruction or damage Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pcap) Decreased intravascular oncotic pressure (πcap) Increased interstitial hydrostatic pressure (πInt) (lymphedema) 1. Heart Failure Clinical Condition Inflammation: (sepsis, ARDS, burns, trauma) Allergic reactions, Angioedema Interleukin-2 therapy Heart failure Nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease Cirrhosis Pregnancy Cirrhosis or hepatic venous obstruction Acute pulmonary edema Local venous obstruction Calcium channel blockers Idiopathic edema (?) Nephrotic syndrome Protein losing enteropathy Liver disease Malnutrition Nodal enlargement from malignancy Hypothyroidism Damage from surgery In heart failure, reduced cardiac output results in decreased EABV with reduced tissue perfusion (arterial underfilling). SNS and RAAS activation act to increase renal Na reabsorption, resulting in total body Na+ expansion. Additionally, high central venous pressures are transmitted to capillary beds leading to increased Pcap and edema. 2. Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the common histological endpoint of chronic, irreversible hepatic injury due to numerous liver disorders. In cirrhosis, portal hypertension leads to the production of vasodilators that preferentially dilate the splanchnic circulation. This  4 5 \\nleads to decreased EABV and activation of the SNS and RAAS.Total body Na+ is expanded, leading to edema. In particular, cirrhosis is associated with ascites, the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen. Additional driving forces for edema in cirrhosis include 1) portal hypertension, leading to increased Pcap, and 2) decreased oncotic pressure (πcap) from reduced albumin synthesis. 3. Nephrotic Syndrome Nephrotic syndrome is defined by glomerular injury leading to heavy proteinuria (see Chapter 11). As a result, Na+ absorption in the renal tubule increases, and the SNS and RAAS are suppressed. In contrast to heart failure and cirrhosis, EABV increases (overfill theory). Loss of protein in the urine also results in decreased oncotic pressure (πcap), further driving the development of edema. Figure 4.3. Mechanisms of edema. Heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome are common causes of edema. Mechanisms of edema include increased Pcap, Na+ retention, and decreased πCap. Clinical Features. Generalized edema does not become clinically apparent until the interstitial volume has been expanded by approximately 2-3 L.The distribution of edema is determined by gravity and is measured on a subjective, qualitative scale of 1+ to 4+. Massive generalized edema is termed anasarca. 6  4 EdemaNa+ RetentionDecreased πcapIncreased PcapHeart FailureCirrhosisNephrotic Syndrome EABVSNS/RAAS activationSNS/RAAS suppressionright atrial pressurevenous pressureurinary protein lossdecreased albumin synthsinusoidal obstructionsplanchnic vasodilation increased ENaCactivationforwardfailure\\nTreatment. Reduction of extracellular volume can be accomplished by administration of diuretics, medications that lead to increased sodium and water excretion in the urine. DIURETICS Diuretics (Table 4.2) are drugs that lead to increased sodium and water excretion in the urine. Although commonly called \"water pills\" it is important to recognize they act by inhibiting Na+ reabsorption in the nephron (Figure 4.4), with water passively following. Indications for use 1. Reduce extracellular volume. This is important in the management of edema (eg heart failure, nephrotic syndrome) and hypertension. 2. Alter excretion of electrolytes. a. Loop diuretics increase K+ and Ca2+ excretion b. Thiazide diuretics decrease urine Ca2+ (used in the treatment of c. K+-sparing diuretics decrease K+ excretion (used in hypokalemia, hypercalciuria and kidney stones) often as adjunct to loop diuretics) 3. Diabetes insipidus. Thiazide diuretics actually decrease urine volumes in DI (see Chapter 5). The mild ECV depletion leads to increased reabsorption of Na+ and H2O in the proximal tubule leading to less distal delivery to the ADH sensitive medullary collecting duct.

Explain the central role of impaired water regulation, in the genesis of hyponatremia (low plasma sodium concentration) and hypernatremia (high plasma sodium concentration). Diagnose the cause of hyponatremia from data, and prescribe treatment, avoiding the complication of over-rapid correction of hyponatremia. Diagnose the causes of hypernatremia and polyuria. REGULATION OF SODIUM CONCENTRATION (OSMOLALITY) Though regulation of total body Na+ determines the size of the ECV, the serum Na concentration is the ratio of Na+ to H2O.Water balance mostly determines the serum Na concentration. Movement of water between the ICV and ECV is governed by osmotic forces. Key Point: Serum sodium concentration is primarily a reflection of water balance. Note that the addition of free H2O (ie free of Na+) to the body will be distributed to both the ECV (1/3 of the administered volume) and ICV (2/3). Osmolality The number of all solute particles per kilogram (liter) of solvent (water) defines the osmolality of a solution. If two solutions are separated by a semi-permeable membrane, water moves from an area of low osmolality to an area of high osmolality (\"osmotic force\"). If plasma osmolality decreases, water will move from ECV and expand the ICV.In the brain this may cause critical cerebral edema, as brain size is limited by the skull vault. Calculation of plasma osmolality. The osmolality of the plasma is equal to the sum of the osmolalities of the individual solutes in the plasma. Because most of the solutes in plasma are Na+ salts, the plasma osmolality can be approximated using the serum Na+ concentration. Since Na+ is accompanied by an equal number of anions (Cl- and HCO3-), the osmolality is close to twice the Na+ concentration. Water balance is controlled by intake (thirst) and by excretion (mostly renal). Water Intake. This is controlled by thirst centers in the hypothalamus. Thirst is stimulated by increased osmolality (eg increased Na+ intake) and hypovolemia. Water Excretion. Water is excreted renally and non-renally: 1. Renal excretion. The kidney controls the amount of water excreted and thus the osmolality and the concentrations of electrolytes in the body. ADH is a key mediator of medullary water excretion (see Chapter 1). 2. Non-renal excretion. Loss of water in sweat, during breathing, and in stool amount to 500 - 1000 mL / day. These are known as insensible losses (Table 4.1). Sweat: Sweat is hypo-osmolar (~80 mOsm/L) compared to plasma, and depending on the environment (heat, humidity, fever etc.), relatively large amounts of water may be lost by this route. Breathing: Water vapor is excreted with each breath. Water loss by this route may be greatly increased with hyperventilation, especially mechanical ventilation. Stool: Only small amounts of water are lost in the stool in the absence of diarrhea. Table 4.1. Typical daily water balance Water Intake (mL/day) DISORDERS OF WATER BALANCE Abnormalities of sodium and water balance are the most common fluid and electrolyte abnormalities in clinical medicine. Abnormalities of water balance lead to: CPR-Renal Chapter 5 2 Source Water Food Oxidation Total Obligatory Elective 400 850 350 1600 1000 1000 Urine Sweat Breathing Stool Total Water Excretion (mL/day) Source Obligatory Elective 500 500 400 200 1600 1000 1000 \\n  Water excess (hyponatremia): The normal response to hyponatremia is to inhibit thirst and turn off ADH, allowing the passage of a dilute urine (minimal ~50 mOsm/kg) to correct the abnormality. Water depletion (hypernatremia): By contrast, in settings of water depletion (hypernatremia), ADH levels should be high to produce a concentrated urine (maximal 1200 mOsm/kg) and retain water. Recall that ADH can be stimulated by factors other than hypertonicity (Table 5.1). Volume depletion or decreased EABV (eg heart failure, cirrhosis) stimulates ADH synthesis, and hyponatremia typically results. Table 5.1. Causes of ADH release Key point: restoration of plasma volume takes precedence over osmolality and ADH is stimulated in volume depletion despite hypo-osmolality. Stimulus Hyperosmolality Decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) Stress Clinical Example Hypernatremia Hyperglycemia Volume depletion Severe heart failure Liver failure Post-operative; nausea; pain HYPONATREMIA (SERUM Na+ < 135 MMOL/L) Hyponatremia represents an excess of water relative to sodium. Two factors are required to develop hyponatremia: 1. Source of electrolyte free water (EFW). Oral or IV fluids are sources of EFW.2. Impaired excretion of dilute urine by the kidneys. This may be due to: ADH action (the most common cause, see Table 5.1) Low urine output, as seen in severe renal failure (GFR < 10 mL/min), or markedly reduced solute intake. Note: Significant intake of EFW alone (psychogenic polydipsia) may cause hyponatremia in the absence of impaired urinary dilution. Clinical Features of Hyponatremia. Clinical features are typically related to the central nervous system and relate to both the degree of hyponatremia and the rate of decline. CPR-Renal Chapter 5 3 \\n  Acute hyponatremia leads to swelling of the brain cells (ICV), cerebral edema and symptoms of confusion, seizure, coma and if severe, tonsillar herniation. Most patients with seizures and coma have serum Na+ <115 mmol/L.  Chronic hyponatremia is often asymptomatic or presents with mild confusion, nausea or falls. In these patients, cerebral adaptation has occurred as the brain cells have excreted intracellular osmoles (taurine, myoinositol, amino acids) to limit cell swelling. In this setting, over-rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia may produce profound neurological abnormalities (osmotic demyelination syndrome). Differential Diagnosis of Hyponatremia. Evaluation of serum osmolality and volume status are key in determining the etiology of hyponatremia (Figure 5.1).

Clinical assessment of hyponatremia. Several factors may be present in the same patient (eg thiazide diuretic use in an older person with poor solute intake and mild chronic renal failure). CPR-Renal Chapter 5 4 \\nClinical Assessment of Hyponatremia 1. Assess serum osmolality. Because most of the solutes in plasma are sodium salts, a reduced serum [Na+] usually corresponds to reduced serum osmolality (SOsm < 280), referred to as hypotonic hyponatremia. Most cases of clinical hyponatremia fall under this category. However, there are a few cases where the serum osmolality is increased: Pseudohyponatremia (280 < SOsm < 295). Serum sodium is measured per volume of plasma, which is ~ 93% water and ~7% proteins and triglycerides. Severe hypertriglyceridemia or severe paraproteinemia (>10 g/dL) decrease the amount of water content per unit plasma. Therefore, although the concentration of sodium in plasma water is normal, the concentration per unit of plasma appears reduced. Hypertonic hyponatremia (SOsm > 295). Hyperglycemia causes hyponatremia because glucose in the plasma generates an osmotic force, driving water from the ICV to ECV.This may also be observed with mannitol treatment. 2. Assess volume status. that Hypovolemia. Recall is appropriately upregulated due to decreased EABV sensed in the carotid baroreceptors and the aortic arch. The cause of hypovolemia can be distinguished by measurement of urine Na+ (UNa+). in hypovolemia, ADH Extrarenal Na+ loss (UNa+ < 10). Vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating can is loss, and urine lead to ADH secretion via RAAS activation. In this setting Na+ retained in the kidney in an attempt to correct the Na+ Na+ will be low. Renal Na+ loss (UNa+ > 20). Diuretic use leads to inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, resulting in hypovolemia. This is associated with a high urine Na+. Euvolemia. Hyponatremia in the setting of euvolemia indicates an impairment in dilute urine secretion due to 1) the actions of ADH or 2) inadequate solute intake / excessive water intake. These can be distinguished by measurement of urine osmolality (UOsm). ADH activity (UOsm >100). Production of a concentrated urine despite hyponatremia indicates inappropriate ADH secretion or action. Several etiologies fall under this category: o Adrenal insufficiency: decreased cortisol in decreased negative feedback to the hypothalamus. This increases secretion of corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), an ADH secretagogue. results o Hypopituitarism is a form of adrenal insufficiency leading to increased ADH secretion. CPR-Renal Chapter 5 5 \\no Some classes of medications are associated with hyponatremia (Table 5.2). o Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia but is a diagnosis of exclusion. In this disorder, hypotonicity fails to suppress ADH secretion. There are several causes of SIADH (Table 5.3). Table 5.2 Drugs associated with hyponatremia Mechanism Drug ADH analogues Stimulation of ADH release carbamazepine; antidepressants*; vasopressin; desmopressin (DDAVP); oxytocin antipsychotic agents*; vincristine/vinblastine; narcotics; Enhanced ADH renal effect NSAID; cyclophosphamide *mechanism unknown for several of these agents.

There is a minimum level to which the kidneys can dilute the urine. If the urine is maximally dilute, insufficient solute intake or greatly increased water intake can cause hyponatremia: o \"Tea and toast\" diet refers to the chronic under-consumption of solutes. This is often associated with the elderly. o Beer potomania is attributed to the excessive consumption of alcohol, especially beer, which has low solute content. o Psychogenic polydipsia is seen in psychiatric patients who drink >15-20L of electrolyte free water per day. Hypervolemia. As described previously (Chapter 4), a decreased EABV due to heart failure or cirrhosis leads to the release of ADH despite the hypervolemic state. Water and Na+ retention by the kidney results. CPR-Renal Chapter 5 6 \\nManagement of Hyponatremia. The treatment of hyponatremia is related both to the underlying cause and the clinical severity. If symptoms are present (seizures, coma), this is a medical emergency. Note: It is not sufficient to successfully correct the hyponatremia without treating the underlying cause. The correction rate for hyponatremia should be less than a maximum of 8 mmol/L over a 24 hr period. Note that if the patient is symptomatic (seizures, decreased level of consciousness), the initial treatment should raise serum Na+ by about 3 mmol/L/hr over the first few hours. Vigilant monitoring is mandatory during this acute stage. Symptomatic Hyponatremia Symptomatic hyponatremia should be treated rapidly. Treatment includes: 1. Intravenous administration of hypertonic 3% saline if patients are severely obtunded or have seizures. 2. Isotonic saline in patients who are volume depleted. The correction of the volume depletion will remove the stimulus for ADH and permit renal excretion of a maximally dilute urine. Great care must be taken as the rapid renal excretion of the excess water may correct the serum Na+ level too quickly. Asymptomatic Hyponatremia In patients with asymptomatic hyponatremia, some cerebral adaptation has occurred and these patients are at risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome (formerly central pontine myelinolysis), a syndrome associated with flaccid paraplegia, dysarthria and dysphagia if corrected too rapidly. Recommended therapeutic strategies include: 1. Water restriction 2. Increased salt intake with furosemide to promote renal water excretion 3. Administration of drugs to antagonize the action of ADH (aquaretics, eg tolvaptan) Note: Great care should be taken in patients with psychogenic polydipsia as water restriction will rapidly correct the serum Na+. HYPERNATREMIA (SERUM Na+ > 145 MMOL/L) Hypernatremia represents a decrease in water relative to Na+ and is almost always due to a problem with water balance. Rarely, excess Na+ intake causes hypernatremia when it is associated with a marked increase in ECF volume. Clinical Features of Hypernatremia. Thirst is the predominant symptom of hypernatremia. The serum hypertonicity promotes water movement from ICF to ECF with shrinking of cells. CNS symptoms may occur (confusion, coma) if the hypernatremia is severe (typically approaching 160 mmol/L). CPR-Renal Chapter 5 7 \\nDifferential Diagnosis of Hypernatremia. Evaluation of urine output is key in determining the etiology of hypernatremia (Figure 5.2): assess urine output oliguria decreased H2O intake insensible losses (diarrhea, sweating) impaired thirst dementia Hypernatremia [Na+] > 145 mmol/L polyuria increased H2O excretion assess urine osmolarity conc. urine (300 > UOsm > 600) osmotic diuresis hyperglycemia dilute urine (UOsm < 100) decreased ADH action administer ADH responds to ADH no ADH response central diabetes insipidus neprogenic diabetes insipidus Figure 5.2. Clinical assessment of hypernatremia. Hypernatremia reflects reduced body water content. Assessment of urine output, and subsequently, urine osmolality, reveals the etiology of hypernatremia. Clinical Assessment of Hypernatremia 1. Assess urine output. Water imbalance (too little water relative to Na+) can be due to decreased H2O intake OR increased H2O excretion. To differentiate between these etiologies, the volume of urine produced is assessed. Oliguria. Insensible losses of water (respiratory tract and sweat) are hypotonic and if not replaced with adequate H2O will lead to hypernatremia. Small urine volumes reflect appropriate action of ADH in the setting of decreased H2O intake. This can be due to lack of access to water (hospitalized patients, nursing home residents, infants) or severe lack of intake (impaired thirst, dementia), resulting in dehydration. Polyuria. Excessive urine production leading to hypernatremia occurs through two mechanisms: 1) osmotic diuresis or 2) decreased ADH action. These can be distinguished by the osmolality of the urine (UOsm). CPR-Renal Chapter 5 8 \\n  Osmotic diuresis (UOsm = 300-600). A urine osmolality greater than serum osmolality in the setting of hypernatremia is most commonly caused by glycosuria secondary to hyperglycemia. Occasionally a high excretion rate of urea (catabolism, high protein feeding, recovery from acute kidney injury) may cause H2O loss and hypernatremia. Decreased ADH action (UOsm < 300). A urine osmolality less than the serum osmolality in the setting of hypernatremia indicates a lack of ADH activity despite the water imbalance (inappropriate free water clearance). This condition is diabetes insipidus (DI), and has several causes (Table 5.4). Patients with DI typically present with intense thirst and polydipsia. DI can be divided into two subcategories. o Central DI is due to a deficiency of ADH, often caused by lesions to the hypothalamus or pituitary. Central DI responds to exogenous ADH.o Nephrogenic DI is due to a problem with the renal response to ADH.Though serum ADH levels are high, urine osmolality remains low. Nephrogenic DI is nonresponsive to exogenous ADH.Note: Patients with DI with access to water tend to have a normal serum sodium. When water restricted, the serum Na+ rises. Table 5.4. Causes of diabetes insipidus Genetic Central Nephrogenic Mutations in vasopressin precursor Mutations in V2 receptor or aquaporin 2 Tumors (pituitary, metastases) Chronic kidney disease Electrolyte disorders (hypokalemia, hypercalcemia) Drugs (lithium) Post surgery / head trauma Acquired Infiltrations (sarcoid, histiocytosis) CNS infections Idiopathic (50%) CPR-Renal Chapter 5 9 \\no Stop ongoing excessive loss of electrolyte free water. Treatment should be aimed at correction of the underlying cause. Osmotic diuresis. Treatment is matched to the cause of the osmotic diuresis, (eg insulin for hyperglycemia). In the case of hyperglycemia, the associated volume depletion should be corrected with half-normal saline. o Central DI.This is responsive to ADH therapy. o Nephrogenic DI.Contributing drugs should be discontinued if possible. Nephrogenic DI due to chronic interstitial disease may not be reversible. Maintenance of a high oral water intake will maintain the serum Na+ in the normal range, but at the expense of polyuria. Measures to decrease the polyuria include dietary changes (low Na+ intake, protein restriction) and drugs that interfere with urine dilution (thiazide diuretics). Management of hypernatremia. There are two aspects to the management of hypernatremia: Replace the water loss with hypotonic fluids (5% dextrose, oral H2O, half-normal saline) at an appropriate rate. The key is to accurately estimate all ongoing water losses (respiratory, sweat, gastrointestinal) and to match these with appropriate intravenous fluids. CPR-Renal Chapter 5 10 \\nChapter 6 Potassium Disorders Authors: Haya Jamali, Sarah Sanghavi & Ashley Jefferson OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: Recognize the clinical implications and risk of potassium abnormalities. Identify the major causes of hyperkalemia and hypokalemia from clinical findings and data Recognize the symptoms and the ECG changes associated of hyper- and hypokalemia. Describe the emergency therapy of hyperkalemia. Predict the changes in potassium concentration occurring in diabetes POTAssIUM DISTRIBUTION Potassium (K+) is one of the most abundant cations in the body. The intracellular space contains 98% of the K+, with only very small amounts in the ECF (Figure 6.1). This contrasts with sodium which is limited primarily to the ECF.ECF [K+] = 4 mmol/L + - + - + - + + + - - - 3Na+ ATPase 2K+ ICF [K+] = 140 mmol/L Figure 6.1 Distribution of Potassium. The large concentration difference for K+ that exists between the intrA-and extra- cellular spaces is maintained by the membrane-bound Na+/K+ ATPase, a transporter found in virtually all cells. Resting membrane potential. The electrochemical gradient for K+ and Na+ are important for a number of processes in the body, including nerve conduction, muscle contraction, fluid transport, and hormone release. Although many cellular ions contribute to the resting membrane potential (Em), the ratio of intracellular to extracellular [K+] is the primary determinant of the Em. Membrane excitability is determined by the difference between the Em and the threshold potential (the potential during depolarization at which an action potential is generated). In normal steady state conditions, the threshold potential is approximately 15 mV less negative than the Em (Figure 6.2).  6 1 \\n Figure 6.2. Potassium and the resting membrane potential (Em). Hypokalemia lowers the Em, increasing the difference between the resting and threshold potentials, rendering the cell less excitable. Hyperkalemia raises the Em, rendering the cell more excitable. Changes in the ECF [K+] can alter the resting membrane potential and result in muscle weakness, cardiac conduction problems and arrhythmias. The K+ concentration in the ECF is therefore closely regulated and maintained within a narrow range. Serum K+ concentration is impacted by potassium intake, potassium shift between ICV and ECV, and renal/GI potassium excretion (Figure 6.3). Figure 6.3. Daily K+ balance. Serum [K+] reflects a careful balance between oral intake and renal/gut excretion. Within the body, K+ is largely relegated to the ICV.Shifts in K+ between the ICV and ECV may occur in certain physiological circumstances. 2  6 Excitability Threshold Action Potential300-30-60 -90-120Membrane Potential (mV)HyperkalemiaHypokalemiaNormal Em\\nPOTAssIUM INTAKE The potassium intake on a typical western diet is approximately ~1 mmol/kg/day. Vegetarians who consume large amounts of K+-rich food may consume twice as much. REGULATION OF POTAssIUM DISTRIBUTION Numerous factors regulate potassium shift (Figure 6.4): 1. Acid/Base Status. In acidotic patients, excess H+ ions are buffered inside cells. The major extracellular anion (Cl-) doesn\\'t enter cells readily, so electroneutrality is preserved by the movement of K+ out of cells (into the ECF). The opposite happens in the setting of alkalemia: the cells release H+ ions to restore the pH toward normal, and, K+ moves into the ICF.2. Plasma Osmolality: An increase in ECF osmolality (e.g, due to hyperglycemia) enhances K+ movement out of cells into the ECF.There are two proposed mechanisms for this phenomenon. If the ECF osmolality increases, water moves from inside the cell to the ECF pulling K+ with it by solvent drag. The water movement out of cells results in an increase in the intracellular [K+], which provides a driving force for K+ movement out of cells.

Acidosis and hyperglycemia lead shift into the ECF, whereas alkalosis, insulin release, and B2 agonism Figure 6.4. Factors contributing to K+ to K+ lead to K+ shift into the ICF.Lorem ipsum  6 3 \\n3. Insulin: Insulin stimulates the Na+/H+ antiporter and the Na+/K+ ATPase driving K+ into cells. This is important following meals: an ingestion of food rich in K+ does not cause life-threatening hyperkalemia because K+ rapidly enters cells. Clinically, insulin is used to treat hyperkalemia. 4. beta2 agonists: Epinephrine and albuterol stimulate the Na+/K+ ATPase, driving K+ into cells. POTAssIUM EXCRETION K+ is excreted via the kidneys (90%) and the stool (10%). To keep K+ in balance, intake must equal excretion. Gastrointestinal potassium excretion GI loss accounts for 5-10 mmol K+ excretion per day, although in advanced chronic kidney disease, this route may account for up to 50% of potassium excretion. Renal potassium excretion (see Chapter 1) Recall that renal potassium excretion is dependent on: 1. Glomerular filtration rate 2. Aldosterone (secretion of K+ at the CCD ROMK channel is indirectly stimulated by ENaC activation due to the action of aldosterone) 3. Distal delivery of Na+ and water (at the CCD, Na+ absorption is required for ENaC activity and indirectly, ROMK activity) Imbalances in potassium intake, shift, or excretion can lead to hypokalemia ([K+] < 3.5 mmol/L) or hyperkalemia ([K+] > 5.1 mmol/L). HYPERKALEMIA ([K+] > 5.1 mmol/L) Clinical Features of Hyperkalemia. The symptoms of hyperkalemia are a consequence of impaired neuromuscular transmission. An elevation of the ECF [K+] will partially depolarize the cell membrane, making cells more excitable. Symptoms are uncommon, although some patients may experience paresthesia, cramps, severe muscle weakness or even paralysis. The main danger is cardiac arrhythmias, particularly bradyarrhythmias or sudden death (Figure 6.5). Differential Diagnosis of Hyperkalemia Hyperkalemia usually reflects an excess in total body K+, whether due to increased K+ intake or decreased K+ loss (urinary or GI). Hyperkalemia may also be a consequence of shift of K+ from the ICF to the ECF (total body K+ may be normal or even low in this setting) (Figure 6.6). 4  6 \\nFigure 6.5. EKG changes in hyperkalemia. Typical changes include peaked T waves, 1st degree AV block, loss of P waves and widening of QRS complex. Risk of bradyarrhythmias or sudden death become more significant when K+ > 6 mmol/L.Pseudohyperkalemia / Artifactual: Pseudohyperkalemia occurs due to K+ movement out of the cells in vitro when phlebotomy was traumatic or there was a long delay (>3 hrs) between the blood draw and separation of the plasma, since K+ may leak slowly from cells. False hyperkalemia (artifactual) may be measured if blood is sampled from a site close to an IV infusion of K+. Note the EKG will be normal in both these conditions. Increased Potassium Intake: Recall that insulin facilitates K+ sequestration inside cells after eating to avoid acute hyperkalemia. Increased intake only causes hyperkalemia in the setting of impaired renal excretion. K+ Shift into the ECF Factors stimulating a shift of K+ out of cells include hyperglycemia, beta blockers, and acidosis. Severe hyperkalemia may also be associated with the release of K+ from necrotic or damaged cells (ie in rhabdomyolysis, severe burns, tumor lysis syndrome, or hemolysis). In these conditions, hyperphosphatemia is also found. Impaired Excretion of K+ Renal K+ excretion requires an adequate GFR, distal Na+ delivery and aldosterone action. Abnormalities in each of these three factors may impair renal excretion. 1. Decreased GFR: This may be due to acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic is filtered, and there are kidney disease (CKD). In these conditions, less K+ fewer functional principal cells to secrete K.2. Reduced distal Na+ delivery: A decreased EABV due to severe volume delivery. Urine depletion or heart failure results in reduced distal Na+ electrolytes show [Na+] (<20 mmol/l).  6 5 \\n3. Impaired aldosterone action (Hypoaldosteronism) Adrenal disease (eg Addison\\'s disease): Low aldosterone levels impair K+ secretion in the CCD.Other features include hypotension, hyponatremia (, hypoglycemia, skin pigmentation (increased ACTH levels) and non-specific symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fatigue). Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism: IV RTA). Low aldosterone levels are consequent to low renin production. This may occur in diabetes (volume expansion, renal interstitial disease), obstructive uropathy, and NSAID use (inhibition of prostaglandin- mediated renin secretion.) (Type Aldosterone resistance: In aldosterone resistance, features typical of hypoaldosteronism are seen but aldosterone levels are normal or increased. This may be due to tubulointerstitial disease or genetic mutations. Drugs causing this include K+-sparing diuretics and trimethoprim (Table 6.1). ACE inhibitors / Angiotensin receptor blockers: All drugs that block the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) may lead to hyperkalemia (Table 6.1). Both ACEIs and ARBs lead to low aldosterone levels. This is a very common effect of these medications as they are frequently used in patients with proteinuric kidney disease and hypertension.

Check EKG for signs of cardiac instability. If EKG changes are present needs emergency treatment. Emergency Treatment If EKG reveals changes of hyperkalemia continue EKG monitoring, and get IV access. There are three goals in the treatment of hyperkalemia: 1. Antagonize the membrane effects of potassium. IV calcium gluconate antagonizes the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart and stabilizes the myocardium. This is short acting and may need repeated. Note this does not change K+ concentration. 2. Shift the extra cellular potassium into cells. Insulin effectively lowers the ECF potassium concentration by 0.5 to 1.5 mmol/L.The effect begins in 15 minutes but only lasts several hours. Insulin should be administered with dextrose to avoid hypoglycemia. Other strategies include administration of NaHCO3 or beta2 agonists. Note all these methods decrease serum K+, but do not reduce total body K+. 3. Remove excess potassium from the body. Cation exchange resins (kayexelate, patiromer) works in the gut to bind K+ and release Na+. Each gram of resin binds approximately 1mmol of potassium. Note that this is slow acting and not appropriate sole therapy in an emergency setting. 4. Dialysis. If the above measures are ineffective, dialysis may be necessary to remove K+ from the body. Non-Urgent Treatment Underlying causes of hyperkalemia should be treated and offending drugs discontinued. A low K+ diet may considered. Loop diuretics may be used in patients with volume expansion.  6 7 \\nTable 6.1: Drug effects on serum K+ Mechanism Causes of Hypokalemia Causes of Hyperkalemia Potassium Shift beta agonists (albuterol) Insulin Effects on Renin Effects on Angiotensin II beta-blockers (metoprolol) Digoxin: (blocks Na+/K+ ATPase) Aliskiren NSAIDs (ibuprofen) beta-blockers ARBs (losartan) ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) Effects on Aldosterone action Mineralocorticoid agonists (fludrocortisone) Spironolactone Heparin Effects on ENaC Triamterene Amiloride Trimethoprim Pentamidine HYPOKALEMIA ([K+] < 3.5 mmol/L) Clinical Features of Hypokalemia (Table 6.2). Many patients with mild hypokalemia (3-3.4mmol/L) are asymptomatic. More severe hypokalemia results in hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, which impairs the ability of the cell to generate action potentials in excitable tissues (muscle and nerve). 1. Neurologic/Neuromuscular effects: Manifestations of hypokalemia include muscle weakness, cramps, and pain in the muscles (myalgias). With severe hypokalemia, muscle necrosis and rhabdomyolysis may occur. Rarely, severe hypokalemia results in paralysis. Respiratory paralysis is rare, but potentially fatal if not corrected quickly. 2. Cardiovascular effects: Hypokalemia is associated with EKG changes, including ST segment depression, reduced amplitude of the T waves, and prominent U waves. Cardiac arrhythmias (atrial tachycardia, atrial ventricular dissociation, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation) may occur. In patients with known heart disease (eg post myocardial 8  6 \\ninfarction or heart failure hypokalemia may induce ventricular arrhythmias and serum K+ should be maintained at the high end of normal. 3. Gastrointestinal and hepatic effects: Hypokalemia may result in paralytic ileus due to smooth muscle dysfunction (decreased peristalsis). In liver disease, hypokalemia increases ammonia production which may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy. 4. Renal and electrolyte effects: Hypokalemia impairs urinary concentrating ability. Table 6.2: Clinical features of hypokalemia Cardiac Neuromuscular Gastrointestinal Pulmonary Renal EKG changes (u waves) Arrhythmias Muscle weakness / paralysis Muscle cramps / myalgias / rhabdomyolysis Paresthesia Ileus Respiratory failure (2nd to respiratory muscle weakness) Increased ammoniagenesis Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus Differential Diagnosis of Hypokalemia (Figure 6.8). Hypokalemia usually (but not always) reflects a deficit in total body K+, whether due to decreased K+ intake or increased K+ loss (urinary or GI). Hypokalemia may also be a consequence of shift of K+ from the ECF to the ICF, either in the blood specimen tube (in vitro) or in the body (in vivo). In this situation, hypokalemia does not reflect a total body K+ deficit. Pseudo-hypokalemia / Artifactual Rarely, metabolically active cells in the test tube can take up K+. If the specimen sits at room temperature, hypokalemia (in vitro only) may be measured. This can be seen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Reduced Potassium Intake This may be due to insufficient K in the diet or intravenous fluids (eg post surgery). Note that decreased intake alone has a relatively minor effect on plasma K+ as urinary potassium losses can be reduced to <20 mmol/d in those normal renal function. K+ Shift into the ICF Factors stimulating a shift of K+ into cells include insulin, beta2-agonists, catecholamines and alkalosis (Table 6.1). Hypokalemia may therefore occur in patients undergoing treatment for diabetes mellitus or asthma. Note that concurrent hypophosphatemia is suggestive of an intracellular K+ shift.  6 9 \\nUrinary Losses of Potassium Diuretics: This is a very common cause of hypokalemia, and occurs with loop, thiazide & osmotic diuretics (but not K+ sparing diuretics). Loop diuretics decrease K+ reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics increased distal delivery of Na+ to the CCD which may lead to K+ wasting (Table 6.1). Genetic disorders (Bartter\\'s and Gitelman\\'s syndromes): As discussed in Chapter 1, these syndromes are rare genetic conditions in which mutations in genes encoding sodium transporters in the loop of Henle and distal tubule respectively and simulate chronic diuretic use. Primary hyperaldosteronism: Some primary overproduction of aldosterone. Patients with this disorder retain Na+ and are therefore slightly hypervolemic (hypertension). ECV excess leads to increased Na delivery to the CCD and lead to a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. Hyperaldosteronism may be due to: patients have o Adrenal adenoma o Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia Hyperaldosteronism mimics: o Black licorice consumption o Liddle\\'s syndrome o Cushing\\'s syndrome o Exogenous steroid use Renal Tubular Acidosis (RTA): Hypokalemia is common in patients with both type I and type 2 RTA (see Chapter 7). Gastrointestinal Losses of Potassium Vomiting: The hypokalemia that develops with vomiting is due to a combination of K+ loss via loss of gastric contents and urinary potassium loss. In most instances, the K+ lost via the kidneys exceeds that lost in the gastric contents: the [K+] in gastric fluid is low. Patients who are vomiting are often ECV depleted. The resultant increased aldosterone levels stimulate potassium secretion in the principal cells. Diarrhea: Potassium is secreted in the colon, and GI K+ loss can be substantial. Laxative abuse may also lead to hypokalemia. Management of Hypokalemia Assessment Decide if this is an emergency situation (paralysis, arrhythmias). Check EKG.Assess cardiovascular status (pulse rate, rhythm, lying and standing BP, JVP, edema) for evidence of arrhythmias and hypo/hypervolemia. 10  6 \\nClinical Evaluation of Hypokalemia. Many causes of hypokalemia are associated with a metabolic alkalosis (Figure 6.7).

Clinical evaluation of hypokalemia. Following assessment of acid- base status, the medication list should be examined carefully. Next, assessment of volume status is key to determining the etiology of hypokalemia. Renin and aldosterone levels are helpful to differentiate the causes of euvolemic/ hypervolemic hypokalemia. Non-Urgent Treatment Any underlying conditions should be treated and causative drugs discontinued. Oral K+ replacement is usually the safest route for K+ replacement, although K+ supplements may cause GI upset. Treatment should be guided by serum K+ measurements. Note that potassium shift should not be treated with large doses of K+ due to rebound hyperkalemia. Emergency Treatment If hypokalemia is severe (<2.5 mmol/L) it may be associated with muscle weakness leading to ventilatory failure or cardiac arrhythmias. Intravenous K+ replacement is appropriate in this setting. KCl should be diluted in normal saline to avoid irritation to peripheral veins.  6 11 \\nPOTAssIUM DISORDERS SUMMARY Hyper- and hypokalemia reflect a loss of balance in K+ intake, shift, or excretion (Figure 6.8).

Understand the difference between acidemia/alkalemia and acidosis/ alkalosis. 2. Explain how the kidney handles excess acid and alkali 3. Diagnose an acid base disorder given lab values (pH, HCO3, and PCO2) and determine if compensation is appropriate. 4. Identify the cause of a metabolic acidosis using the concept of the serum anion gap 5. Use the urine anion gap to determine the cause of non- gap acidosis 6. Use the urine Cl to determine the cause of a metabolic alkalosis Metabolic Acid & Base Load Acid. Metabolism of proteins results in an acid load due to the generation of H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) from sulfur-containing methionine/cysteine and HCl (hydrochloric acid) from other amino acids, eg lysine/arginine. Additionally, metabolism of organophosphates yields small amounts of H3PO4 (phosphoric acid). There is also small daily production of acids from cellular metabolism (lactic acid/pyruvic acid/acetic acid). Metabolism of fats and carbohydrate generates ~ 15,000 mmol CO2 per day. Recall that in the renal tubule, CO2 combines with water via carbonic anhydrase activity to generate H2CO3 (carbonic acid.) However, CO2 is largely excreted by ventilation in the lungs with no net acid gain. Base. Daily alkali generation includes that from amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and organic anions (acetate, citrate). Vegetarian diets contain higher levels of alkali containing foods. However, acid production usually exceeds alkali production. A Western diet generates a net ~ 1 mmol/kg H+ per day which must be excreted by the kidneys. Blood pH The pH of a solution is related to the hydrogen ion concentration: pppp=\\t-log[pp*] The pH of the ECF is maintained within a narrow range (~7.4), corresponding to a [H+] of 40 nanomoles/L.Note that this concentration of H+ is tiny compared to the millimolar concentrations of Na+ in the ECF and to the daily load of H+ (1 mmol/kg) which must be excreted.  7 1 \\n Venous pH is 0.05 less (more acidic) than arterial pH due to the generation of CO2 in the tissues before removal by the lungs. Intracellular pH is lower than extracellular pH and varies between tissues (eg skeletal muscle ~ 7.06; proximal convoluted tubule ~ 7.13). Note that nanomolar changes in [H+] result in biologically significant changes in pH: a change in [H+] from 40 to 25 nanomoles/L causes a large change in pH from 7.4 to 7.6. The pH of the ECF is determined by ratio of HCO3 to PCO2 as described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: The H2CO3 concentration can be derived from the arterial PCO2 by multiplying by the solubility constant for CO2 in plasma (0.03 in mm Hg). Changes in the concentration of HCO3 or PCO2 result in changes in blood pH.Recall that a net 1 mmol/kg of H+ is generated each day. The body has multiple mechanisms for maintaining normal pH: Blood pH is determined by the equation: Extracellular pH is maintained close to 7.4 by: 1. Buffering of free H+ 2. Alveolar ventilation (removing CO2) 3. Renal excretion of H+ -] at ~24 mmol/l and the lungs maintain the PCO2 at In the normal state, the kidneys maintain the [HCO3 about 40 mm Hg, resulting in a pH of 7.4. BUFFERS A buffer is a substance (usually a weak acid or its base) that is able to release or take up H+, so that changes in H+ concentration are minimized. In the body, the majority of H+ is buffered initially by HCO3 in the extracellular fluid. Other buffers are recruited as the acid load increases. ECF buffers Bicarbonate (HCO3 inorganic phosphates. Bicarbonate is the most important buffer in the ECF. Minor buffers include plasma proteins. The CO2 generated by this reaction is excreted by alveolar ventilation. If the level of HCO3 diminished. Renal excretion of H+ must occur to replenish HCO3- buffer. - falls, the buffering capacity of the ECF falls and the defense against acidosis is 2  7 \\n ICF buffers - and ICF buffers include intracellular proteins (histidine side chains), hemoglobin in erythrocytes, HCO3 phosphates (Table 7.1). Buffering in bone (by CaCO3 and calcium phosphates) can lead to bone demineralization. The greater abundance of intracellular buffers leads to a more robust maintenance of intracellular pH. Note that H2CO3 cannot be buffered by its own conjugate base (HCO3). In this equation, the potassium salt of hemoglobin (KHb) is used to represent all non-carbonic buffers. From the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation we can see that the pH is determined by both the PCO2 and the [HCO3 The PCO2 is determined by the balance between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation, and is maintained between 35 and 45 mm Hg in the normal resting state, most commonly at 40 mm Hg. The accumulation of CO2 (and resultant H2CO3) generated each day from metabolism is prevented by alveolar ventilation. Increased [H+] is sensed by central chemoreceptors in the medulla, which signal to the brainstem respiratory centers to increase ventilation. Hyperventilation leads to a decrease in PCO2 (\"blowing off CO2\") and a respiratory alkalosis. Conversely, hypoventilation results in an increase in the PCO2, the formation of H2CO3, and a respiratory acidosis. RENAL CONTROL OF ACID BASE The kidneys are responsible for reclaiming filtered bicarbonate in the proximal tubule and regenerating bicarbonate in the cortical collecting tubule by excreting H+. The daily acid load of H+ (1 mmol/kg) is excreted as NaH2PO4 and NH4Cl (Chapter 1). The amount of NaH2PO4 is fixed, and so to excrete a greater  7 3 \\nacid load, extra NH4 Diseases that affect the mechanisms involved in reclaiming bicarbonate or excreting NH4 tubular acidoses (RTAs). + (ammonium) is generated and excreted, with the resultant generation of HCO3-. + result in renal CLINICAL AssEssMENT OF ACID-BASE STATUS The following is a seven step approach that can be used to determine the acid base status of a patient (Figure 7.1). Step 1 - Check the pH? (normal = 7.35-7.45) pH < 7.35 implies acidemia pH > 7.45 implies alkalemia pH in the normal range implies either no acid base disturbance or a complex disorder where acidosis and alkalosis exactly cancel each other out. Step 2 - Check the serum bicarbonate (HCO3 HCO3 < 22 implies metabolic acidosis HCO3 > 28 implies metabolic alkalosis -). (normal = 22-28 mmol/L) Step 3 - Check the arterial PCO2. (normal = 35-45 mm Hg) PCO2 > 45 mm Hg implies respiratory acidosis PCO2 < 35 mm Hg implies respiratory alkalosis pH < 7.35 Acidemia pH 7.35 < pH < 7.45 pH > 7.45 Alkalemia PCO2 > 45 mm Hg [HCO3- ] < 22 mmol/L no abnormality or mixed disorder PCO2 < 35 mm Hg [HCO3- ] > 28 mmol/L respiratory acidosis metabolic acidosis respiratory alkalosis metabolic alkalosis Figure 7.1. Algorithm for Acid-Base Analysis. Assessing a patient\\'s acid-base status relies on the pH, PCO2, and [HCO3 Step 4 - Assess compensatory responses. In order to maintain the pH in a narrow physiological range, the kidneys try to compensate for respiratory acid-base disorders and the lungs try to compensate for metabolic disorders. -]. 4  7 \\nIn the setting of metabolic acidosis (low pH, low HCO3), alveolar ventilation increases (PCO2 increase), returning pH to the normal range. Similarly, in the setting of a respiratory acidosis (low pH, high PCO2), the kidneys excrete H+ (HCO3- increase) to return the pH to the normal range. Note that when there is a single primary disorder, the compensatory response never over-corrects the pH. Time course for compensation. The time course of metabolic compensation for respiratory disorders is over hours to days as opposed to ventilatory compensation, which occurs within minutes to hours. As a result, respiratory disorders are subdivided into acute processes (no compensation) and chronic processes (compensation has occurred). Because ventilatory compensation is very rapid, metabolic disorders are not classified as acute or chronic because there is no way to distinguish between the two based on the changes in PCO2.  Magnitude of compensation. There are expected changes in HCO3 and PCO2 following respiratory and metabolic disorders respectively (Table 7.2). In respiratory acidosis, the change in bicarbonate that results from buffering in an acute process will be smaller than with a more chronic process that allows time for renal compensation. For metabolic acidosis, Winter\\'s Formula can be used to evaluate respiratory compensation.\\n\\nStep 5 - Assess the anion gap. The anion gap is the calculated difference between cations and anions in the blood, and is roughly equal to the negative charge contributed by proteins (16 mmol/L). However, the concentration of K+ (~ 4 mmol/L) varies little, and the simplified equation becomes: The normal value for the anion gap is dependent on the serum protein concentration and approximates to 3 x [albumin] (g/dL). In a hypoalbuminemia condition, where serum albumin concentration is only 3 g/dL, the expected anion gap would be 9. The predominant cation in the blood is Na+, while the predominant anions are Cl- and HCO3. The anion gap is calculated for two main reasons: 1. To help determine the etiology of a metabolic acidosis. 2. To determine if a complex metabolic disorder is present (eg in a patient with a metabolic acidosis from diabetic ketoacidosis and a simultaneous metabolic alkalosis from vomiting). Step 6 - Assess the D/D (change in anion gap/change in bicarbonate). - were the only buffer, there would be a 1:1 relationship between the increase in anion gap and the If HCO3 fall in serum [HCO3] in an anion gap metabolic acidosis. With mild degrees of acidosis this is the case. However, as the acid load increases, H+ can be buffered by other intracellular buffers and the change in anion gap is usually greater than the change in HCO3. Mixed metabolic alkalosis/acidosis. If the D/D is much greater than 1.5:1, it suggests the -]) and an simultaneous presence of an underlying metabolic alkalosis (which raises the [HCO3 anion-gap metabolic acidosis (eg vomiting in patient with diabetic ketoacidosis). 6  7 \\n  Mixed non-anion gap acidosis/anion gap acidosis. Similarly, if the D/D is less than 1:1 it implies the presence of a non-anion gap acidosis in addition to the anion gap metabolic acidosis (eg lactic acidosis with simultaneous renal tubular acidosis). Davenport Diagram. The acid-base relationships described above can be represented graphically using a Davenport diagram (Figure 7.3). Any point in the diagram shows a potentially coexisting combination of three variables: pH, PCO2 and HCO3. Step 7 - Identify underlying cause of acid-base disturbance. Once the type of acid-base disorder has been identified it is important to establish the underlying cause of the disorder. RESPIRATORY ACID BASE DISORDERS Respiratory Acidosis is defined by the presence of an elevated PCO2 (> 45 mm Hg). This indicates that the patient has hypoventilation, and alveolar ventilation is inadequate for metabolic requirements. Respiratory Alkalosis is defined by the presence of a low PCO2 (< 35 mm Hg). This indicates that the patient has hyperventilation, and alveolar ventilation is in excess of that needed for metabolic demands. It is impossible to have concurrent respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. Common causes of these disorders are listed in Table 7.3.  7 7 \\nTable 7.3. Examples of conditions causing primary respiratory disorders Respiratory Alkalosis Anxiety or severe pain (increased respiratory drive) Respiratory Acidosis Opiate overdose (decreased respiratory drive) Severe COPD (increased dead space) High Altitude (hypoxemia) Neuromuscular Disease (decreased tidal volume) Obesity hypoventilation syndrome Salicylates (increased respiratory drive) Liver disease (progesterone +/- hypoxia) Pregnancy (progesterone) METABOLIC ACID BASE DISORDERS - (< 22 mmol/L). Rarely, a low [HCO3- Metabolic acidosis is defined by the presence of a low serum HCO3 ] may be due to a compensatory response to a chronic respiratory alkalosis (eg pregnancy) in which case the pH will be > 7.4. As [H+] is determined by the ratio of PCO2 to HCO3-, the appropriate respiratory response to a metabolic acidosis (HCO3) is to hyperventilate (\"blow-off CO2\"). If acidosis is severe, the marked increase in ventilation (due to both an increased respiratory rate and depth of respiration) is known as Kussmaul respiration. Causes of Metabolic Acidosis A metabolic acidosis can be caused by a gain of acid or loss of bicarbonate. Calculation of the anion gap helps establish the cause of metabolic acidosis (Figure 7.5). The severity of a metabolic acidosis is dependent on a number of factors including volume status, rate of acid generation, presence of hypoxia, degree of respiratory compensation and any associated potassium disorders. In general, a metabolic acidosis is becoming extremely dangerous if the pH is < 7.2 and/or the bicarbonate is < 10. The consequence may be depressed myocardial contractility and impaired enzyme function. Treatment should be aimed at treating the underlying disorder responsible for acid production (eg insulin in ketoacidosis or hemodialysis for ethylene glycol poisoning) and accompanying electrolyte derangements. Elevated Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis 1. Lactic Acidosis Cellular metabolism requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for energy, much of which is produced from carbohydrate metabolism. Glucose can be metabolized by glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation to produce ATP (Figure 7.4). In the absence of O2 as an electron acceptor, NAD+ (a cofactor for glycolysis) is regenerated by the conversion of pyruvate to lactate (lactic acid) and the increased lactate is an unmeasured anion (hence the anion gap). Lactic acid is buffered by HCO3, Normal serum lactate levels are 1-1.5 mmol/L, and a lactic acidosis is present if levels are greater than 4- 5 mmol/L in an acidemic patient. Following recovery, lactate can be metabolized by the liver back to pyruvate. Lactic acidosis has a variety of etiologies (Table 7.4). Table 7.4. Causes of lactic acidosis Type A Type B Anaerobic metabolism due to tissue hypoxia Shock (Hypovolemic, septic, cardiogenic, anaphylactic) Lung problem (severe hypoxemia < 25-30 mm Hg) Hemoglobin problem (CO poisoning) Increased O2 requirement (seizures, sprinting) Impaired lactic acid metabolism without hypoxia Impaired lactate clearance (due to hepatotoxins, inborn errors, ethanol, tryptophan). The metabolism of glucose through glycolysis and the Krebs cycle generates ATP.In the presence of oxygen, the NAD+ is regenerated by oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. In states of hypoxia, NAD+ is instead regenerated by the conversion of pyruvate to lactate and ATP is generated by anaerobic glycolysis. Type A Lactic acidosis. Any condition that impairs oxygen delivery to the tissues leads to the formation of lactate. This is most often seen in ill patients with hypotension due to sepsis, hypovolemia or cardiogenic shock. An ill patient in the ICU with sepsis syndrome has problems with both gas exchange and oxygen delivery to tissues (from hypotension) and is likely to have a persistent metabolic acidosis. An acute lactic acidosis is common during marked physical exertion (\"the burn\") when enhanced energy requirements temporarily outstrip oxygen delivery. An Olympic sprinter\\'s venous pH may drop to to ~6.8 (with lactate levels < 20). This is rapidly reversed as the oxygen debt is quickly replaced. Treatment. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause of the lactic acidosis with the aim of increasing tissue oxygenation. Measures to correct shock are the principal intervention. Type B Lactic acidosis. A second type of lactic acidosis occurs in patients with abnormal lactate metabolism in the setting of adequate tissue oxygen delivery. This is much less common and is usually due to a drug effect (eg metformin, HIV medications), inborn errors of metabolism or mitochondrial dysfunction.  7 9 \\nNote that metformin is a widely used hypoglycemic agent. Metformin-induced lactic acidosis occurs more commonly in those with renal impairment, and metformin should be discontinued when GFR falls below 30 mL/min. D-lactic acidosis. Types A and B lactic acidosis result from the accumulation of the physiological L-form of lactic acid. Rarely, in sick patients with bacterial overgrowth in the bowel, gut organisms can produce D-lactic acid, which is not metabolized by L-lactic dehydrogenase. The resulting D-lactic acidosis is important to consider if the cause of an anion gap metabolic acidosis is unclear, as D-lactate is not measured by standard assays for lactic acid. D-lactic acidosis Bacterial overgrowth in bowel 2. Ketoacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA occurs in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who have absent or very low levels of insulin. Recall that insulin is required to allow the movement of glucose into most cells (excluding brain and liver), permitting the production of ATP.Without insulin, an alternate source of energy is required, and free fatty acids are oxidized to provide a source of ATP to the brain. Oxidation of free fatty acids to ketoacids (acetoacetic acid and b-hydroxybutyric acid) generates an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Clinical features. Patients with DKA typically present with decreased level of consciousness, Kussmaul breathing, hyperglycemia and severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH may be less than 7.0). The elevated 10  7 \\nserum glucose also raises the serum osmolality, leading to a shift of water to the ECV, an osmotic diuresis, and volume/K+ depletion. Treatment. Treatment with intravenous fluids, insulin and K+ replacement will permit correction of the metabolic abnormalities. Phosphate replacement may also be required. Insulin therapy will allow the metabolism of ketoacids, generating HCO3 Alcoholic ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis may rarely occur in patients who are not diabetic. In patients who abuse alcohol, a ketoacidosis may develop in those who have been vomiting and are volume depleted. The insulin deficiency in this setting may be due to intense sympathetic stimulation. Treatment with intravenous fluids alone will reverse the ketoacidosis (dextrose to stimulate insulin release and saline to replace any volume deficit). 3. Renal Failure - and replenishing the buffer . As the number of functioning nephrons decreases, the ability of the kidneys to excrete acid falls. The accumulation of anions such as sulfate, phosphate, urate and hippurate in this setting results in a raised anion gap. The acidosis of renal failure is not usually severe, and typically only becomes apparent when the GFR < 25 mL/min, unless there is an additional non-anion gap acidosis (from renal interstitial disease). The chronic acidosis in this condition may lead to bone demineralization, skeletal muscle wasting, and worsening of the underlying renal disease. As such, NaHCO3 treatment is often required. 4. Poisoning Methanol and ethylene glycol. These potentially fatal alcohols may be ingested for their intoxicating effects or in a suicide attempt. Metabolism of these compounds by alcohol dehydrogenase produces formic acid (from methanol) or glycolic and oxalic acids (from ethylene glycol) which are responsible for the anion gap metabolic acidosis. The early signs of intoxication are drunkenness, which progresses to nausea, blindness and coma (methanol) or oxalate crystalluria and acute kidney injury (ethylene glycol). Emergency treatment includes inhibiting the metabolism of these alcohols with fomepizole or ethanol and hemodialysis. Aspirin. Aspirin intoxication can lead to complex acid base disturbances, characteristically a respiratory alkalosis from direct stimulation of the respiratory center and a mild anion gap metabolic acidosis primarily due to the accumulation of lactic acid and ketoacids (not salicylic acid!). Emergency treatment may include alkali therapy and hemodialysis. Osmolal gap. A clue to the presence of these toxins may be made by determining the osmolal gap. This is the difference between the measured serum osmolality and the calculated osmolality. The normal value is < 10 mOsm. An osmolal gap > 25 implies the presence of unmeasured osmoles (eg methanol, ethylene glycol, or ketones), and is highly suggestive of methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning (Figure 7.5). Poisoning should be considered in a patient with an anion gap metabolic acidosis and an increased serum osmolal gap. Non-gap Metabolic Acidosis (Hyperchloremic Metabolic Acidosis) Clinical Assessment The underlying cause of a non-anion gap is most commonly GI bicarbonate loss or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). It is usually relatively straightforward to differentiate between these etiologies from the clinical history. However, determining the type of renal tubular acidosis may be more difficult. Urine Anion Gap Calculation of a urine anion gap allows differentiation between GI HCO3 loss and RTA in situations where the history is unreliable (Figure 7.5). The normal value ranges between 20-50 mmol/L, reflecting the balance of dietary ion intake. In metabolic acidosis, NH4Cl excretion increases and the urine anion gap is expected to drop to -75 to -100 mmol/L.However, in renal tubular acidosis there is a failure of ammonium excretion and the UAG maintains a positive value. 1. Gastro-intestinal HCO3 loss Pancreatic and intestinal secretions are basic, and diarrhea can therefore result in loss of base and a metabolic acidosis. As unmeasured anions are not added to the serum, there is no change in the anion gap. The kidneys can compensate for this metabolic acidosis, and the acidosis is rarely marked unless there is concomitant renal impairment, possibly due to volume depletion. 2. Renal Tubular Acidosis Renal tubular acidosis is due to either the inability to reabsorb filtered bicarbonate (proximal RTA) or to impaired excretion of ammonium chloride (distal RTA). - reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule (Chapter 1) and failure to Proximal RTA.90% of HCO3- results in a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis. Proximal RTA usually occurs in the reabsorb this HCO3 setting of proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi syndrome) and presents with glucosuria, aminoaciduria and phosphate wasting. The most common cause of proximal RTA in adults is multiple myeloma. 12  7 \\n+ from glutamine in the proximal tubule, medullary recycling of NH4 Distal RTA.H+ is excreted by the kidney predominantly as NH4Cl and NaH2PO4. As the amount of NaH2PO4 excretion is relatively fixed, increased acid loads are excreted predominantly as NH4Cl. This +, requires the generation of NH4 generation of a negative lumen charge via ENaC activity in the CCD, and the secretion of H+ by the apical H+ ATPase. Abnormalities anywhere in this process can result in a distal RTA.The most common cause in adults is Sjogren\\'s syndrome, which reduces the expression of H+ ATPase in the CCD.-] may fall below 10 mmol/L). In distal RTA, a pronounced metabolic acidosis may develop (serum [HCO3 Associated features include hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis due to hypercalciuria (bone demineralization) and hypocitraturia. Type IV Renal Tubular Acidosis. Impaired aldosterone secretion or aldosterone resistance results in a mild non-anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of hyperkalemia. Impaired aldosterone action results in reduced Na+ reabsorption and diminished H+ and K+ secretion in the CCD, resulting in a metabolic acidosis. Hyperkalemia itself also decreases ammoniagenesis in the proximal tubule so less ammonia is available in the CCD as a proton acceptor. The most common cause of a Type IV RTA is hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism seen in patients with diabetes mellitus or other tubulointerstitial diseases.

The lungs compensate for a metabolic alkalosis by hypoventilation, which retains CO2 and lowers the pH toward the normal range (Table 7.2). Clinical manifestations of metabolic alkalosis are related to the alkalemia as well as the underlying cause of the disorder. Musculoskeletal symptoms (cramps, weakness) are often due to hypokalemia. Cardiovascular symptoms (hypotension, arrhythmias) result from volume depletion and hypokalemia, respectively. Alkalemia itself can also result in cardiac arrhythmias due to ventricular irritability, as well as CNS symptoms (disorientation, lethargy, and seizures). Pathophysiology of Metabolic Alkalosis Under normal conditions, the kidneys are able to excrete excess HCO3 not develop simply due to the administration or ingestion of NaHCO3. A sustained increase in [HCO3] can only occur if two factors are present: - and a metabolic alkalosis will 1. A source of alkali (vomiting or renal H+ loss from diuretics) 2. Factors resulting in HCO3- absorption: - ECV depletion (stimulates RAAS) - Chloride depletion (stimulates distal H+ secretion) - Aldosterone excess (stimulates Na+ reabsorption in the CCD and increased H+ secretion) Causes of Metabolic Alkalosis The causes of metabolic alkalosis are usually divided into those with a decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) and those with an increased EABV (Table 7.5). If the kidneys are functional, the appropriate response to a decreased EABV is to retain Na+, and the urine [Na+] should be low (< 20 mEq/L). However, in metabolic alkalosis, there may be an obligate loss of Na+ - in the urine. In this setting, hypovolemia is more accurately detected from a low urine chloride with HCO3 (< 20 mEq/L). The UCl is therefore used to differentiate between the causes of metabolic acidosis (Table 7.5). UCl will be > 20 mEq/L in a euvolemic/hypervolemic state. Table 7.5. Causes of Metabolic Alkalosis Urine chloride < 20 mEq/L (hypovolemia) Gastric fluid loss (vomiting) Post-diuretic therapy Urine chloride > 20 mEq/L (euvolemia/hypervolemia) Primary hyperaldosteronism Exogenous steroids Cushing\\'s Syndrome Diuretic use 14  7 \\n-, correcting the alkalosis. Vomiting. HCl in gastric juice is lost with vomiting. The associated volume depletion from NaHCO3 loss in the urine leads to RAAS stimulation, H+ secretion, and an inability of the kidneys to excrete the excess -. This phenomenon is also seen in patients placed on nasogastric suction in the hospital. Note the HCO3 urine Na+ may not be as low as predicted in the setting of volume depletion due to obligate urine loss of Na+ with HCO3-. Treatment with normal saline and KCl will expand the ECV and allow the kidneys to excrete the excess HCO3 Diuretics. Loop and thiazide diuretics act by decreasing sodium reabsorption in the loop and distal convoluted tubule respectively. This urinary loss of Na may lead to volume depletion, subsequently raising aldosterone levels. The decreased Na reabsorption earlier in the nephron increases CCD delivery of Na+ and acts synergistically with aldosterone to enhance the reabsorption of Na+ in the CCD.The luminal electronegativity generated by increased CCD Na+ reabsorption increases excretion of K+ and H+. Syndromes that mimic loop and thiazide diuretics such as Bartter\\'s syndrome and Gitelman\\'s syndrome cause a metabolic alkalosis by similar mechanisms. Primary Hyperaldosteronism (Conn\\'s syndrome). Primary hyperaldosteronism is due to either bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or an adrenal tumor (adenoma) producing aldosterone. It typically presents as hypertension with hypokalemia and a mild metabolic alkalosis. CCD delivery of Na+ is high due to the volume expanded state. In the setting of both high aldosterone action and CCD Na+, a metabolic alkalosis develops and is maintained. A good screening test for primary hyperaldosteronism is the aldosterone/renin ratio, which will show a high aldosterone level and low renin. Treatment consists of aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or eplerenone) and surgery, if indicated, for an aldosterone secreting adrenal adenoma. Table 7.6.

Calculate the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa), know how to use the FENa in the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury. Recognize the causes of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), the pathogenesis, the clinical characteristics and phases and outcomes of ATN Describe the clinical presentation and management of allergic interstitial contrast rhabdomyolysis and nephritis, hepatorenal nephropathy syndrome, INTRODUCTION Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined as a rapid reduction in renal function (glomerular filtration rate, GFR). The renal failure develops over hours to weeks, in contrast to chronic kidney disease, which develops over months to years. AKI may result in disturbances in extracellular volume, acid base status, electrolyte concentrations, and in the accumulation of uremic toxins. AKI is common, with an incidence of 2-5% of patients admitted to general medical hospitals, and up to 30% of patients admitted to intensive care units. Most cases of AKI are reversible. Unfortunately, half of patients who develop AKI in the ICU setting die, not as a result of the AKI, but as a consequence of the severe underlying illness (eg sepsis). Those who survive may be left with residual chronic kidney disease. ETIOLOGY Acute kidney injury is conventionally categorized into pre-renal, intra-renal, and post-renal AKI (Figure 8.1). The majority of cases of AKI are due to either pre- renal or intra-renal causes. Obstruction accounts for <10% of cases of AKI in most series. Acute kidney injury is also classified as oliguric AKI or non-oliguric AKI based on daily urine excretion. Oliguria is defined as a daily urine volume of less than 500 mL/day. Anuria is <50 mL/ day.  8 1 \\nIntrarenal Intra-tubular obstruction Vascular Disorders Glomerulonephritis Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) Pre-renal Hemorrhage GI losses Heart failure Cirrhosis Post-renal Bladder outlet obstruction Bladder cancer Kidney stones Figure 8.1. Causes of acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is categorized into pre- renal, intrarenal, and post-renal causes. PRE-RENAL AKI Pre-renal AKI is the most common cause of AKI.It represents a normal physiologic response to renal hypoperfusion - \"a good kidney looking at a bad world\". The integrity of the nephron is preserved and the kidneys attempt to hold on to Na+ and water to improve renal perfusion leading to a low urine Na+ (<10 mmol/L) and a concentrated urine (Uosm > 500mOsm/kg). The renal failure is rapidly reversed with restoration of renal perfusion. If the pre-renal AKI is allowed to persist without appropriate therapy, tubular damage (acute tubular necrosis) may develop (see below). Reduced renal perfusion may be due to true volume depletion (ECV depletion) with relative hypotension, or to decreased effective circulating volume (EABV) as seen in heart failure, sepsis, or cirrhosis. 2 Low cardiac output (heart failure) Cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome) Hypoalbuminemia (nephrotic syndrome) 1. Volume depletion Hemorrhage GI losses Pancreatitis Rhabdomyolysis 2. Decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) Causes of Pre-renal AKI (or pre-renal uremia)  8 \\n Heart Failure (cardio-renal syndrome). AKI is common in severe heart failure. It may be due to worsening of the heart failure itself and low cardiac output / hypotension (cardio-renal syndrome). Note renal congestion is often a major contributor. Excess use of diuretics and ACE inhibitors may exacerbate AKI in this setting. Hepatorenal syndrome. The hepatorenal syndrome refers to the development of AKI in a patient with advanced liver disease. The hepatorenal syndrome results from marked reductions in renal perfusion. As hepatic disease becomes more severe, there is a progressive decrease in vascular resistance (splanchnic and peripheral vasodilatation) and, despite a rise in cardiac output, the systemic blood pressure falls. Hypotension induces activation of the RAAS and SNS.It is postulated that splanchnic vasodilatation diverts blood away from the kidneys. Clinically, hepatorenal syndrome is characterized by oliguria, a benign urine sediment, a very low rate of sodium excretion (UNa <10), and a progressive rise in the plasma creatinine concentration. The onset of renal failure is typically insidious, but can be precipitated by an acute insult such as gastrointestinal bleeding or infection. Although hepatorenal syndrome is a form of pre-renal AKI, it does not respond to volume expansion with IV normal saline. INTRA-RENAL AKI (intrinsic renal disease) Intrinsic acute kidney injury may be sub-classified according to the region of the kidney predominantly affected (vessels, glomerulus, tubules, interstitium) (Figure 8.2). Vasculitis and glomerulonephritis are covered in Chapter 10. Acute tubular necrosis and acute interstitial nephritis are discussed here. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) ATN is the most common cause of intra-renal AKI.Pathology: Typical features include vacuolization and loss of brush border of proximal tubular cells. Sloughing of injured cells into the tubular lumen & binding to Tamm Horsfall protein results in the detection of muddy brown casts in the urine. Etiology of ATN: Tubular cells are injured by ischemia (ATP depletion) or direct nephrotoxic injury. Often a combination of these factors is present (eg AKI in a hypotensive septic ICU patient treated with nephrotoxic antibiotics).  8 3 \\n1. Ischemic ATN.This develops from severe renal hypoperfusion. The major sites of tubular injury are the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, especially as it dips into the relatively hypoxic medulla, as these are the most metabolically active segments of the nephron (major sites of Na+ reabsorption). 2. Nephrotoxic ATN.A range of endogenous and exogenous toxins may directly lead to tubular cell injury. Common nephrotoxic agents leading to ATN 1. Exogenous toxins Aminoglycosides Amphotericin Foscarnet Cisplatin NSAID Radiocontrast agents 2. Endogenous toxins Myoglobin (rhabdomyolysis) Hemoglobinuria (hemolysis) Uric acid (tumor lysis syndrome)  Rhabdomyolysis: Rhabdomyolysis may occur in multiple clinical settings, including crush injuries, cocaine use, excess alcohol, profound exercise / seizure and with certain medications (statins). Muscle breakdown leads to free myoglobin in the blood which is filtered and may be found in the urine (myoglobinuria). If severe, the combination of nephrotoxic injury (myoglobin) and ischemic injury (hypotension 2nd to third spacing of fluid in injured muscle) may result in AKI secondary to ATN.  Hemoglobinuria: Severe hemolysis may result in heme pigment associated ATN.  Contrast Nephropathy: IV radiocontrast given with some radiological procedures (CT scan, angiography) may be nephrotoxic. Those at greatest risk are patients who have impaired renal function. Other risk factors include diabetes, myeloma and volume depletion or heart failure. Strategies to decrease the risk of contrast nephropathy include: o Avoiding radiocontrast if possible (alternate imaging), or limiting the dose o Using isosmolar agents o Use of IV normal saline or sodium bicarbonate to ensure volume expanded and good urine output o Administration of N-acetyl cysteine prior to imaging study 4  8 \\nAcute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) Etiology of AIN.The three main causes of acute interstitial nephritis are drugs, infections (e.g., acute bacterial pyelonephritis, viruses) and autoimmune diseases (eg Sjogren\\'s syndrome). The most common cause is drug hypersensitivity. Although there are more than 80 drugs reported to cause AIN, only a few are responsible for most cases. Common Causes of Drug Associated AIN Penicillins Sulfonamide drugs (Bactrim, diuretics) Proton pump inhibitors NSAIDs Clinical features. Patients with drug-induced AIN typically develop renal impairment 1-2 weeks after exposure to the offending agent, however, it can happen within days if the patient has had prior exposure to the medication. Other signs of allergic reaction (fever, rash, and eosinophilia) are present in one third of the patients. Presentation of AIN varies, but AKI is usually non-oliguric, often mild, but can be severe and require dialysis. Examination of the urine under the microscope (urine sediment) usually reveals white blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts. Both eosinophilia and eosinophiluria (using Hansel\\'s stain) occur in less than 50% of patients. Proteinuria is usually low grade. Some patients develop signs of tubular dysfunction, such as polyuria (defect in concentration), volume depletion (defect in Na+ conservation), hyperkalemia (defect in K+ excretion), and metabolic acidosis (defect in H+ excretion). The kidneys usually are larger than normal because of interstitial edema caused by the inflammation. Pathology. The hallmark of AIN is infiltration of the interstitium with inflammatory cells with associated edema. While neutrophils and eosinophils are usually present early in the disease process, the most numerous cells are lymphocytes. The inflammatory reaction may involve the tubular cells (tubulitis). Glomeruli and blood vessels are spared. Treatment. With a classic presentation, the diagnosis may be made and confirmed by improvement with stopping the offending agent. A kidney biopsy may be required if the diagnosis is unclear. AIN is generally reversible, and the overall prognosis is good. If the offending agent is not stopped, however, permanent damage can occur. Corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial in severe cases, but there are no definitive studies supporting steroid treatment.  8 5 \\nIntra-tubular Obstruction Acute crystal-induced nephropathy. A relatively uncommon cause of AKI, crystals may be generated endogenously due to high cellular turnover (i.e., uric acid, calcium phosphate crystals), as observed in tumor lysis syndrome, which is encountered with the treatment of certain malignancies. Ingestion of certain toxic substances, such as ethylene glycol, can result in intratubular obstruction due to oxalate. Multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma may lead to casts composed of filtered light chains which obstruct the tubules (cast nephropathy). Small vessel Injury Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). This is a cause of AKI where endothelial injury leads to a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Hematological features include anemia with schistocytes, hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. It is commonly 2nd to a diarrheal illness with shigatoxin producing E.coli, and may occur in outbreaks. It affects both children and adults. In other cases, the TMA is secondary to abnormalities of the alternate pathway of complement. POST-RENAL AKI Urinary Tract Obstruction This is most commonly due to bladder outlet obstruction in men (prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma). Other causes of obstruction include pelvic malignancies, irradiation, and kidney stones (only if bilateral or a single functioning kidney!) CLINICAL AssEssMENT OF THE PATIENT WITH AKI Is this AKI or CKD? Occasionally the clinician is presented with a patient who has newly diagnosed renal impairment (reduced GFR). How do we determine if this is an acute or chronic process? Prior labs: If a patient with a current plasma creatinine of 5.0 mg/dL had a plasma level of 1.0 mg/dL a month ago, we know the patient has acute disease! Imaging: Often, kidneys that fail due to a chronic process shrink in size over time due to fibrosis. Conversely, the kidneys do not have time to shrink in AKI.Small kidneys (less than 9 cm longitudinally) are suggestive of CKD.Note: Normal size kidneys may occur in some forms of CKD (eg diabetic kidney disease, amyloid) Urine output: Oliguria is diagnostic of AKI.Conversely, impaired concentrating ability in CKD may lead to polyuria. 6  8 \\nSymptoms: Nonspecific symptoms of uremia may be helpful in differentiating AKI and CKD.A history of nausea, fatigue, weight loss, pruritus and mental cloudiness that has been longstanding, suggests chronic disease. Other laboratory evaluation is not of much help in differentiating between AKI and CKD.Both can have anemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia, acidosis, and hyperkalemia. DETERMINATION OF THE ETIOLOGY OF AKI Review of the History and Records The clinician should focus on the history and recent clinical events, with particular focus on the exact date of onset of the AKI and the clinical setting in which it occurred (Table 8.1). For example, if the patient underwent a radiological contrast study immediately before the AKI, contrast nephropathy might be a likely cause. The clinician should also focus on medications have been started and stopped recently, esp. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or ACE inhibitors. The clinician should also look for a history suggestive of pre-renal causes of AKI.The presence of hemorrhage, GI losses (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea) or excessive renal losses (diuretics) are helpful in determining the etiology of AKI.Table 8.1. Historical features associated with AKI.Disease process History Vasculitis Acute tubular necrosis Interstitial nephritis Atheroembolic renal disease History of a recent angiographic procedure; evidence of distal embolization (eg blue toes) Systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, arthritis, rash, cough and hemoptysis Episodes of hypotension or the use of nephrotoxic agents Presence of recent new medications, fever and rash The presence of multiple myeloma (cast nephropathy); chemotherapy for bulky tumors (tumor lysis syndrome); ingestion of antifreeze Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), prostate cancer, kidney stones, difficulty in urination including hesitancy, decreased stream and incontinence. Intratubular obstruction Post-renal failure Physical Exam The major focus of the physical exam is on the extracellular volume (ECV) status. The goal is to evaluate for evidence of decreased perfusion (hypotension,  8 7 \\ntachycardia, orthostatic blood pressure changes, dry mucous membranes). A decreased EABV is suggested by hypotension with exam findings of volume overload (edema, S3, ascites, pulmonary edema). Other useful findings may include rash (AIN, vasculitis), toe nail infarcts (atheroembolism), The physical exam for post-renal obstruction would include palpation of the bladder. Also, a large prostate on digital rectal exam or pelvic exam showing adenopathy or masses, suggest the possibility of post-renal AKI.Serum Laboratory Testing Serum creatinine. This is used to assess the degree and course of AKI, but is not useful for the determination of etiology. BUN / creatinine ratio. Approximately 40 to 50% of the filtered urea is passively reabsorbed (primarily in the proximal tubule). Volume depletion is associated with enhanced proximal Na+ and water reabsorption (angiotensin II) which leads to increased reabsorption of urea. In this setting, the BUN will rise out of proportion to any change in creatinine (not reabsorbed, indeed secreted) An elevated BUN/Creatinine ratio (> 20:1) is suggestive of decreased renal perfusion (pre-renal AKI). This is in contrast to ATN, where the plasma BUN/creatinine ratio is normally 10-15:1. Note: A high plasma BUN/creatinine ratio is also seen in the setting of increased urea generation (GI bleed, steroids or catabolism). Evaluation of the urine (Table 8.2) Urinalysis and urine sediment. Characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the urine sediment strongly suggest certain diagnoses: o Minimal findings on the urine, ie the absence of protein, blood leucocytes or any casts in the urine suggest pre-renal AKI.o Granular and pigmented (muddy) casts and free-floating tubular epithelial cells suggest acute tubular necrosis. o The presence of white cells (pyuria), white blood cell casts, and/or urine eosinophils suggest inflammation in the kidneys, seen in acute interstitial nephritis. o The presence of proteinuria, hematuria, red blood cells, and red blood cell casts suggests an acute glomerulonephritis. o Abundant crystals point towards a diagnosis of intra-renal obstruction, which may be seen with oxalate nephropathy (as observed phosphate nephropathy, drugs. ethylene-glycol ingestion), after Urine electrolytes and osmolality. These are useful in the differentiation of the two most common forms of oliguric AKI (hypoperfusion) and ATN). 8  8 \\nIn hypoperfusion, tubular functions are intact, and the kidneys can appropriately reabsorb Na+ (via aldosterone) and water (via ADH). This results in a low urine Na+ (<10 mmol/L) and a concentrated urine (>500 mOsm/kg). By contrast, tubular injury in ATN interferes with these processes and UNa is higher (>20 mmol/L) and urine osmolality is similar to plasma (~300 mOsm/kg). Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). FENa is more accurate than the urine Na+ alone to differentiate between pre- renal AKI and ATN as it accounts for urine abstraction of H2O by ADH. A FENa value below 1% suggests pre-renal disease, whereas a value above 2% usually indicates ATN. A value between 1 and 2% may be seen with either. FENa can be determined by calculation of excreted and filtered Na+. The fractional excretion of sodium is the percentage of the filtered substance. Sodium excretion is equal to the product of the urine sodium concentration [UNa] and the urine flow rate (V). Note that the FENa and the urine sodium concentration are both difficult to interpret with concurrent diuretic therapy, since the ensuing natriuresis will raise the FENa even in patients with pre-renal disease. Where Ucreat is urine creatinine and Pcr is plasma creatinine.  8 9 \\n\\nTable 8.2. Urine studies in pre-renal AKI and ATN.Pre-renal AKI ATN Urine Na+ (mmol/L) FENa (%) Urine osmolality (mOsm/kg) Urine sediment <10 <1% > 500 Bland >40 >2% ~ 300 Pigmented granular casts Imaging studies of the kidney Imaging studies of the kidney are very useful in the diagnosis of AKI.Ultrasound or CT scans of the kidneys are important tools to determine kidney size (see discussion of AKI vsCKD above) and to exclude post-renal obstruction. Sometimes the etiology is not clear even after the above assessment. In that situation, a judicious trial of intravenous fluids may be warranted, in case the patient has a component of pre-renal AKI.A kidney biopsy may also be considered. COMPLICATIONS OF AKI The mortality of patients with AKI in the ICU is nearly 50% depending on the type of AKI and co-morbidities. Most patients don\\'t die of their AKI, but die of the underlying disease or complications (Table 8.3). Table 8.3. Complications of AKI (uremia) Etiology Clinical Scenario Electrolyte abnormalities Hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, Failure to excrete H+ ECV excess Impaired immunity Impaired platelets Uremia hypocalcemia Metabolic acidosis Hypertension, edema Infection Bleeding Nausea and vomiting, seizures, pericarditis What happens to the kidneys after an episode of AKI? 50-60% of the patients who survive acute tubular necrosis recover renal function completely, but 40% have incomplete recovery. Only about 5% of patients with AKI develop permanent renal failure, which requires long-term maintenance hemodialysis. 10  8 \\n TREATMENT OF AKI The treatment of pre-renal AKI is focused on correction of intravascular volume depletion (if present) and correction of any of the underlying diseases that may compromise renal perfusion. The treatment of intrarenal AKI is largely supportive, including adjustment of medications, provision of appropriate nutrition, correction of volume status, and institution of dialysis when necessary. Medications that may be nephrotoxic should be discontinued in the setting of AKI.Dialysis In some, the kidney function may need to be replaced by dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) until the kidneys have recovered. intractable volume excess toxic levels of drugs that may be dialyzable (lithium, aspirin, ethylene glycol, methanol) The indications to initiate dialysis in patients with AKI include: hyperkalemia severe metabolic acidosis symptoms of uremia  8 11 \\n 12  8 \\nChapter 9 Chronic Kidney Disease Author: Sarah Sanghavi and Haya Jamali OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: Understand the major risk factors for the development and progression of CKD.  Understand the role of blood pressure control and blockade of the renin- angiotensin system (RAAS) in slowing progression of CKD.  Understand the pathophysiology underlying complications of CKD including renal bone disease and anemia. Describe the clinical features of uremia and recognize the indications to start dialysis. DEFINITON OF CKD CKD is a clinical syndrome of progressive kidney injury typically evolving over the course of several months to years (Figure 9.1). Irreversibility is a key feature of CKD and is evident by scarring and fibrosis of the renal parenchyma. CKD staging A minimum of two measures of GFR (actual or estimated) at least three months apart are required to establish the diagnosis of CKD.  The earliest stages of CKD (stage I and II) have a GFR >60 ml/min and typically are clinically silent. In stage I and II CKD, additional features of kidney injury must be present: o biochemical features (proteinuria and/or hematuria) OR o radiographic markers (scarring or cortical thinning) of injury A patient has end- stage kidney disease (ESKD) once they require regular renal replacement therapy to manage the complications of CKD.Figure 9.1. The 5 Stages of CKD.Adapted from NKF/KDOQI guidelines.  9 1 \\n Figure 9.2: Leading causes of ESKD in the United States (2017 USRDS) data OTHER RISK FACTORS ETIOLOGY Diabetes is the most common cause of ESKD in the United States, followed closely by hypertension. Together, they account for 3/4 of all cases of ESKD.7%3% 14% 29% Diabetes 47% Hypertension Glomerular Disease Cystic Disease Social determinants Geographic regions with high poverty rates have the highest rates of ESKD.It is well established that systemically racist policies, practices, and procedures have led to the inequitable access to the social determinants of health.12 More recently, the AMA passed a resolution stating that \"Racism is a threat public health\" and must be addressed.3 (RACISM) Norton et al.

Prevalence data reveals non-random clustering in the southeast US region, which has been ascribed to socio- demographic factors as well as co-morbid conditions (diabetes, obesity). Low birth weight A birth weight less than 5.5 pounds, due to intrauterine growth restriction or pre- term delivery, correlates with a reduction in nephron number and subsequent development of hypertension and progressive renal injury. Chronic Kidney Disease in Black Patients There are well documented disparities in the progression of chronic kidney disease in Black Americans as compared to White Americans. Although Black Americans comprise 13% of the United States population, they account for greater than 30% of patients with ESKD.Black Americans are also less likely to be identified as kidney transplant candidates.4 As mentioned, structural racism, including pervasive policies that perpetuate disparities in socioeconomic status and access to high-quality healthcare, play a major role in the high burden of ESKD among Black Americans.5 There is a single known genetic risk factor for CKD.Particular variants of the ApoL1 gene primarily associated with West African ancestry confer biologic susceptibility to CKD.In places where Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei) is endemic, the ApoL1 G1 and G2 alleles are found at a frequency of up to 50%.6 These alleles encode a protein that confers resistance to Trypanosomiasis. The presence of two variant alleles are strongly associated with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)7 and hypertension- attributed8 ESKD with odds ratios of 10.5 and 7.3, respectively. The ApoL1 G1 and G2 alleles are a risk factor for the development of non- 4 Norton, JM et al. Social determinants of racial disparities in CKD.J Am Soc Nephrol 2016; 27: 2576. 5 Laster M et al.

PROGREssION OF CKD Hyperfiltration injury. The pathogenesis of the progression of CKD varies with the underlying disease and is beyond the scope of this text. However, hyperfiltration injury is a common final pathway of almost all chronic kidney diseases. As the functional nephron mass is reduced, intraglomerular capillary pressure is increased in the remaining nephrons. The resultant hyperfiltration maintains GFR and ensures excretion of toxic substances. However, elevated intraglomerular capillary pressures leads to scarring. Rate of Decline While CKD is a progressive disorder, the rate of decline in renal function is highly variable depending on underlying cause: A range of 3 to 5 mL/min annual decline in GFR is typical An annual decline greater than 5 ml/ min is considered rapid Glomerular diseases tend to progress at a more rapid rate than disorders of the tubulointerstitial compartment or hypertensive renal disease The rate of decline (slope) tends to be stable for an individual patient barring additional insults and can be used to predict the GFR trajectory Albuminuria The risk of progression of chronic kidney disease to ESKD correlates well with the amount of albuminuria. A urine albumin/ creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g significantly increases the risk of progression across every GFR value. This parameter is routinely checked at clinic visits. Histopathology In some cases, kidney biopsies may be done to determine the underlying etiology of CKD and can also provide prognostic information. Scarring characterized by interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy is a prominent feature of CKD and the strongest histopathologic predictor of long-term renal prognosis. 4  9 \\nSTRATEGIES TO SLOW CKD PROGREssION Anti-hypertensive therapy Most patients with CKD have hypertension, and poorly controlled blood pressure is a major risk for disease progression. Blood pressure may be challenging to control in CKD, requiring multiple agents. Volume expansion contributes to elevations in BP, so diuretics are often used. RAAS blockade (ACE-I or ARB) should be first line therapy in proteinuric chronic kidney disease. Antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system ACEIs and ARBs have been shown to decrease progression of CKD in patients with proteinuric kidney disease when compared to other antihypertensives. These reno- protective effects are likely due to their effects of decreasing proteinuria and reducing intraglomerular pressure over time. However, these agents are not without their risks especially in advanced CKD.In the short term, this reduction in intraglomerular capillary pressure may decrease the eGFR by up to 20%. Further,aldosterone blockade predisposes to hyperkalemia in the setting of reduced eGFR Severe AKI may be precipitated patients with underlying bilateral renal artery stenosis. Due to these hazards, kidney function and serum potassium levels should be checked within 2 weeks of initiating therapy. Sodium- glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors SGLT2 inhibitors block reabsorption of sodium with glucose in the proximal tubule leading to glucosuria, natriuresis, and improved glycemic control. They have recently been shown to decrease progression of CKD and cardiovascular mortality.. One of the proposed mechanisms for this benefit is a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Since sodium is not reabsorbed proximally, a high sodium concentration is sensed by the macula densa in the distal tubule resulting in afferent arteriole vasoconstriction. COMPLICATIONS OF CKD Anemia Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone that binds to a receptor on the erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to promote red blood cell production. EPO is produced by interstitial cells within the kidney in response to low tissue 5  9 Blood pressure and diabetes control ACEI or ARB in proteinuric CKD SGLT2 inhibitors Treatment of metabolic acidosis Smoking cessation Low sodium diet Strategies to slow CKD progression include: \\noxygen levels sensed by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), an EPO transcription factor. EPO deficiency in kidney disease leads to anemia. Anemia usually develops at stage IV CKD and is hypoproliferative and normocytic. Iron deficiency and chronic inflammation may also contribute to anemia in CKD patients. Recombinant EPO is given to patients to maintain hemoglobin in the 10- 12 g/dL range. Mineral bone disorder of CKD Metabolic bone disease is highly prevalent among patients with CKD and encompasses a spectrum of abnormalities ranging from low bone turnover to high bone turnover states. Collectively these disorders are referred to as renal osteodystrophy and all are associated with a significantly higher rate of fractures. Calcitriol (1,25-OH vitamin D) is produced in the kidney and levels fall as CKD progresses, which may result in low Ca2+ levels. Phosphate (PO 4 3-) levels rise 3-, and due hypocalcemia all lead to an elevation in parathyroid hormone (PTH) which increases bone turnover (Figure 9.3).

Vitamin D: administration of 1, 25- OH Vit D (calcitriol) to decrease Metabolic acidosis Ammonium excretion falls when the glomerular filtration rate drops below 40 to 50 mL/min. Net retention of hydrogen ions ultimately results in a progressive metabolic acidosis. Acidemia may have a series of deleterious effects: secretion of PTH.  Bone buffering of the excess hydrogen ions is associated with the release of calcium and phosphate and further weakening of bone Acidosis increases skeletal muscle breakdown and diminishes albumin synthesis, leading to muscle wasting and weakness. The adaptive increase in ammonia production per nephron may accelerate tubulointerstitial injury Acidemia may exacerbate hyperkalemia 2nd to transcellular shift of K+ (citrate is converted to the bicarbonate in the liver). HCO3 supplementation: oral sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate Diet: reduce acid generation by moderating protein intake (to ~0.8 g/kg Treatment of metabolic acidosis in CKD: body weight per World Health Organization guidelines); emphasis on egg or plant-based sources of protein. Hyperkalemia As GFR falls, the ability to excrete potassium is impaired, resulting in potentially life- threatening hyperkalemia. The symptoms induced by hyperkalemia are due to impaired neuromuscular transmission - within the myocardium, hyperkalemia can result in arrhythmias and sudden death. Strategies to prevent development of hyperkalemia in patients with CKD include: 8  9 \\nInstitution of a low K+ diet   Being cautious with drugs which may raise serum K+, notably ACE-I, ARB, nonselective ss blockers, and NSAIDs Treating chronic metabolic acidosis CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF PROGREssIVE RENAL DISEASE Uremia Manifestations of CKD are often quite subtle. Progressive accumulation of toxins (urea and nitrogenous waste) account for many of the symptoms associated with later stages of CKD including: Altered sense of taste/ poor appetite/ nausea Sleep disturbances Shortness of breath (often due to pulmonary edema or metabolic acidosis) Muscle cramps/ restless legs Edema Difficulty concentrating Easy bleeding due to platelet dysfunction If uremia is untreated, life threatening complications such as encephalopathy, seizures, and pericarditis w/ pericardial effusion can occur. RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY There is no strict GFR (or creatinine) cut-off for dialysis initiation, and this decision must be tailored to the individual patient. Many of the symptoms noted above improve with renal replacement therapy. Modalities of renal replacement therapy include: Hemodialysis Peritoneal dialysis Kidney transplantation Clinical indications for initiation of dialysis: A detailed discussion of dialysis and renal transplantation is beyond the scope of this chapter.

Recognize the type and origin of different proteins found in the urine. Appreciate the significance of microalbuminuria as a marker for diabetic kidney disease and cardiovascular risk. Understand the use of urinalysis as a screening test. Recognize dysmorphic versus non-dysmorphic hematuria. Recognize typical causes of hematuria and origins within the urinary tract. METHODS TO ANALYZE THE URINE Semi-quantitative Tests Urinalysis (UA). UA is a dipstick test that can be performed in the office and is semi-quantitative only. It is heavily dependent on urine concentration, which is variable. The standard UA tests for hematuria, proteinuria, leukocytes, urine pH, glucose, nitrites (from bacteria), bilirubin, urobilinogen & urine ketones. Urine microscopy. Microscopy of fresh urine allows for assessment of cells (RBC, WBC, tubular cells, urothelial cells), casts (RBC, WBC, granular, muddy brown), organisms (bacteria, fungi) and crystals (oxalate, uric acid, phosphate). It is regularly performed in the lab and in the nephrologist\\'s office. Quantitative (Spot Urine) Tests Urine electrolytes. Urine electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-) are commonly checked in the assessment of electrolyte disorders and in AKI to help determine renal perfusion. A fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) may be calculated. Urine protein-creatinine ratio. This ratio gives an estimate of the urine total protein excretion, but is much more convenient for the patient (see Proteinuria below). Albumin-creatinine ratio. This ratio is an estimate of urine albumin excretion and is a more sensitive (and expensive) test for lower level albumin excretion (see Microalbuminuria below).  10 1 \\n24-hour Urine Tests A 24-hour urine collection is the gold standard for accurate measurement of urine constituents, but it is difficult for patients to collect an accurate 24 hr urine.collection. It should be validated by checking the 24hr urine creatinine excretion (15-20mg/kg for women, 20-25mg/kg for men) to ensure an adequate collection. Creatinine clearance. Creatinine clearance can be calculated (UV/P) and used to estimate renal function (GFR). 24-hour urine protein. Urine total protein is measured. Stone former panel. Measurement of urine Na+, Ca2+, oxalate, and uric acid is used to assess the metabolic risk for developing kidney stones and as a guide to medical therapy. Other. Many other hormones and electrolytes can be measured on a 24 hr specimen. Bence-Jones proteins (monoclonal light chains) can be measured for assessment of myeloma. PROTEINURIA Normal Proteinuria A healthy person generally excretes < 100mg/day of urinary protein. The composition is: < 10-30 mg albumin 10-20 mg low molecular weight proteins that are freely filtered 40-60 mg of secreted proteins such as Tamm Horsfall protein GLOMERULAR PROTEINURIA Glomerular proteinuria is due to an increase in the permeability of the glomerular capillary wall which occurs due to injury to one or more components of the glomerular filtration barrier: endothelial cell, basement membrane, and/or podocyte. The result is leakage of high molecular weight proteins, chiefly albumin, into the urinary space. With more severe damage to the glomerulus, additional high molecular weight proteins such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors escape the glomerular filtration barrier. With massive proteinuria, (> 3.5 grams per day), these urinary protein losses can lead to a syndrome characterized by low serum albumin, hyperlipidemia, and severe edema called nephrotic syndrome (see Chapter 11: Glomerular Disease). 2  10 \\n Glomerular proteinuria may be classified into: Microalbuminuria Macroalbuminuria Nephrotic range proteinuria 30-300mg/24h (of albumin) > 300mg/24h (of protein) > 3.5g/24h Microalbuminuria The presence of small amounts of albumin in the urine (just over the threshold for normal values) is the earliest clinical indicator of diabetic kidney disease. The natural history of diabetic nephropathy begins with microalbuminuria that is followed years later by the development of macroalbuminuria (also termed \"overt proteinuria\") with subsequent slow decline in GFR leading to more advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The presence of microalbuminuria is also a powerful predictor of cardiovascular disease, even in non-diabetics, and may be a sign of generalized endothelial dysfunction. Among patients with microalbuminuria, strict control of blood pressure (< 130/80) and the use of RAAS inhibitors have been shown to reduce progression of renal disease and reduce cardiovascular mortality. Early detection of microalbuminuria can set the stage for lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapy, which can greatly improve outcomes for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Measuring Microalbuminuria Note that microalbuminuria cannot be detected on a routine urine dipstick. Typically the dipstick does not turn positive until the patient has macroalbuminuria (> 300 mg/24 hours). The albumin creatinine ratio (ACR). To detect microalbuminuria, a spot (un- timed) urine is sent to the lab for a urine albumin and urine creatinine measurement. Ideally this is done on a first morning urine for reproducibility & accuracy. Albuminuria can be transient (due, for example, to fever or heavy exercise) and therefore the albuminuria screen must be repeatedly positive over a 3 month period to be considered significant. Microalbuminuria Screening Screening for microalbuminuria is generally performed at diagnosis in Type II diabetics and yearly thereafter. Among Type I diabetics, microalbuminuria is very rare before 5 years of disease duration. Thus, current recommendations are to screen 5 years after diagnosis of Type I diabetes and yearly thereafter. Screening of nondiabetics as an assessment of cardiovascular risk can be started at any time. Once a patient has macroalbuminuria, it is no longer necessary to screen for microalbuminuria. Patients at this stage will commonly spill other urinary proteins  10 3 \\nin addition to albumin. Further measurement of urinary protein can then be performed using the tools discussed below under \"measuring proteinuria.\" NON-GLOMERULAR PROTEINURIA Tubular Proteinuria Under normal circumstances, many low molecular weight proteins are freely filtered by the glomerulus. These are taken up and metabolized by the tubular calls such that minimal amounts are excreted in the urine. When tubules are diseased, these \"tubular proteins\" end up in the urine. Examples include b2-microglobulin and amino acids. Overflow Proteinuria In multiple myeloma and other diseases in which immunoglobulins are made in excess, the high amounts of filtered protein overwhelm the tubules\\' capacity for absorption and these proteins spill into the urine. This is known as overflow proteinuria. Multiple Myeloma and Kidney Disease Multiple myeloma is a clonal disorder of plasma cells leading to the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins. Clinical Features: Multiple myeloma typically occurs in middle aged to older individuals who present with anemia, fatigue, bone pain (lytic lesions), and hypercalcemia. AKI is common due to precipitation of light chains within renal tubules (cast nephropathy). Light chains (molecular weight 22 kDa) are freely filtered at the glomerulus and normally reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. Resorptive capacity can be overwhelmed in patients with multiple myeloma. Direct proximal tubule injury in multiple myeloma may also cause Fanconi syndrome (a proximal tubulopathy leading to urinary losses of PO4, uric acid, bicarbonate and glucose) Tamm Horsfall Protein The tubule cells themselves make protein, which they secrete, into the luminal (urinary) space. The main tubular protein is called Tamm Horsfall protein. This protein is best known for forming the matrix of urinary casts. It is postulated to have a variety of other roles, and may act as an inhibitor of kidney stone formation. BENIGN PROTEINURIA 4  10 \\n Transient Proteinuria It is estimated that 5-10% of the population will have occasional episodes of proteinuria that do not persist. These episodes can occur in the setting of fever, heavy exercise, or an exacerbation of CHF.They are thought to result from transient changes in glomerular permeability, perhaps due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Urinary tract infections can also cause transient, low level (~500 mg) proteinuria. Therefore, it is important to test for proteinuria on several occasions before pursuing further work-up. Orthostatic Proteinuria Children and young adults may excrete a small amount of protein (< 1 g daily) when they are ambulating, which goes away when lying down. This is known as orthostatic proteinuria. The etiology of orthostatic proteinuria is poorly understood but the prognosis is benign. The diagnosis is made by demonstrating the absence of proteinuria on a first morning void. MEASURING PROTEINURIA Quantifying urinary protein allows us to: Screen for early diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular risk (see microalbuminuria above) Differentiate between glomerular and tubular disease Differentiate between types of glomerular disease Predict progression of kidney disease Gauge effects of treatment Urinalysis (Urine Dipstick) The dipstick is a narrow strip impregnated with a reagent that changes color based on the concentration of protein in the urine specimen being tested. The result is semi-quantitative and graded as \"trace\" to 4+. There are important limitations to relying on the dipstick alone for quantifying proteinuria: The dipstick senses only negatively charged albumin and will not detect states of overflow proteinuria (such as multiple myeloma). The dipstick depends on the concentration of urine. Therefore, very dilute urine can miss significant proteinuria, whereas very concentrated urine can cause a false positive result. The lower limit of detection is roughly 300 mg/day. This is the threshold for macroalbuminuria. Therefore, the dipstick is not an effective way to screen for microalbuminuria. 24 hour urine protein A 24 hour urine is often considered the gold standard\" for quantifying urinary protein. The patient collects their urine for a 24 h period of time into a large brown  10 5 \\n jug(s) and submits it to the lab. The total protein as well as the total creatinine in the sample are measured. Incomplete or \"over\" collections can lead to spurious results. The best way to confirm a proper collection is to make sure that the total 24 hour creatinine excretion is a good match for the patient\\'s body weight. (Creatinine excretion is estimated at 15-20 mg/kg for females and 20-25 mg/kg for males.) The urine volume alone is not a good measure of the adequacy of the collection, since it depends on solute and water intake. Example 1: You have asked a 31 year-old male to obtain a 24-hour urine collection. He weighs 100 kg. He brings you 1300 mL of urine with a UCreat of 100 mg/dL.Was his urine collection accurate? Answer: This patient\\'s daily creatinine excretion is estimated at 2000-2500 mg of creatinine. His urine contains (13 dL x 100 mg/dL) = 1300 mg of creatinine. His collection is insufficient, indicating that some of his urine was \"missed.\" Spot protein/creatinine ratio Because the 24 hour urine collection is both inconvenient and vulnerable to collection error, many nephrologists rely on the spot protein/creatinine ratio to estimate 24-hour protein excretion. For an average person, daily creatinine excretion is close to 1000 mg/1.73 m2. This ratio is less reliable at extremes of muscle mass. For example, a competitive weightlifter is likely to excrete much more than 1000 mg creatinine per day. Therefore the spot ratio will underestimate their 24-hour protein excretion. By contrast, an ill patient with extremely low muscle mass may excrete only 500 mg/day. In this case, the 1000 mg /day estimate will greatly overestimate the degree of proteinuria. In practice, however, clinicians follow trends in the protein/creatinine ratio to assess disease activity or response to treatment. The absolute number is therefore less important than the trend. Albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) vsProtein/creatinine ratio (PCR) A frequent question is when to check an albumin/creatinine ratio versus a protein/creatinine ratio. In general, ACR is used to detect the presence of early diabetic kidney disease. Once macroalbuminuria becomes persistent, we commonly follow patients using the PCR.Whichever you choose, sticking with the 6  10 \\n same measurement makes it easier to assess progression of disease or response to treatment. HEMATURIA Blood in the urine is an extremely common finding and its prevalence increases with age. While a patient may report bloody urine, it is far more common to: 1. Discover hematuria during an evaluation for other symptoms or lab abnormalities (flank pain, dysuria, renal dysfunction, proteinuria). 2. Discover asymptomatic hematuria in the setting of a routine dipstick done for other purposes. 20 15 10 % 5 0 Male Female 18-29 30-39 40-49 50-59 60-69 70-79 80+ Figure 10.1. Prevalence of hematuria by age. Data from a single urinalysis. Macrohematuria. Defined as visible blood in the urine: pink, red, or \"cola\" colored. Note that urine may appear in variable shades of red in the absence of blood. Causes of red urine include: Hematuria Medications: rifampin, phenolphthalein, iron, sorbitol Food pigments: beets, food coloring Metabolites: bile pigments, porphyrins Red urine due to medications, food pigments, or metabolites will result in a negative urine dipstick result for blood. Microhematuria. Microhematuria is detected by urinalysis and seen only under the microscope. It is defined as > 3 RBC\\'s per high power field of spun urine sediment.  10 7 \\nDiagnosis Urine dipstick (urinalysis). When evaluating for blood in the urine, most clinicians will start with the common dipstick. The dipstick is extremely sensitive, but not specific. It is designed to detect any heme pigments and will turn positive in two other important settings: 1. Rhabdomyolysis, in which massive skeletal muscle breakdown releases myoglobin, a protein containing heme, and 2. Hemolysis, where large amounts of hemoglobin are released by lysed RBCs. In both of these conditions, the dipstick is positive, but red cells will be absent from the urine sediment. Urine sediment A positive urine dipstick should prompt careful analysis of the urinary sediment. Approximately 10 cc of urine are centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm. The supernatant is decanted and the sediment suspended. A small drop is placed on a routine slide and viewed under conventional light microscopy. Red blood cells in the urine can take several forms: 1. Monomorphic -These RBCs are the classic round/donut shape normally seen on a typical blood smear. These normal RBCs can indicate bleeding anywhere in the genitourinary tract. 2. Crenated - The red cell membrane may exhibit \"spikes\" due to RBC shrinkage in hypertonic milieu. This is not a pathologic finding. 3. Dysmorphic - These RBCs manifest blebs, budding, or loss of the cell membrane. The presence of dysmorphic RBC\\'s is highly suggestive of glomerular disease. 4. RBC casts: After filtering through the glomerulus, red blood cells imbedded in Tamm Horsfall protein may appear in the urine as cylindrical casts. RBC casts are pathognomonic for glomerular disease. Normal Crenated  10 8 \\n Figure 10.2. Monomorphic (\"normal\") and crenated RBCs. As viewed by conventional light microscopy. a b Figure: 10.3. a) Dysmorphic RBCs & b) RBC casts. (light microscopy). Causes of Hematuria Blood can originate from any site in the urinary tract. Glomerular bleeding is rare, and instead most bleeding originates in the upper (kidney, ureter) or lower (prostate, bladder, urethra) urinary tract, at sites beyond the glomerulus. In young women, it is important to rule out the possibility of menstrual blood contamination. Common causes of hematuria include: Urinary tract infection (cystitis) Kidney stones Exercise Trauma Prostatic diseases Cancer of the prostate, bladder, or kidney In patients with persistent monomorphic hematuria, further testing is performed to determine the site of bleeding. This usually involves radiological studies (CT abdomen) and/ or evaluation of the bladder (cystoscopy). Exercise Hematuria. This is a benign condition which can occur in children and adults, more commonly associated with endurance exercise \"runner\\'s hematuria\". The mechanism is unclear, but the hematuria typically clears by 72hrs. Glomerular causes of hematuria. Bleeding from the glomerulus is suggested by the presence of dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts. The presence of significant proteinuria is also highly suggestive of glomerular pathology. Three glomerular diseases commonly present with isolated macro or microhematuria: 1. Thin basement membrane disease. This is an autosomal dominant disorder in which congenital thinning of the basement membrane accounts for mild persistent hematuria. It is estimated that 1% of the population carry this trait. The prognosis is generally benign. 2. IgA nephropathy. This is the most common form of glomerulonephritis worldwide that leads to ESRD (see Chapter 9).  10 9 \\n3. Hereditary nephritis. This is (usually) an X-linked disorder in which abnormalities in type IV collagen synthesis lead first to thinning and later thickening of the glomerular basement membrane. Men are vulnerable to kidney failure, whereas women (heterozygous carriers) may manifest only persistent hematuria and are less likely to develop ESRD.Summary When evaluating a patient with a positive dipstick for blood (Figure 10.4), ask: 1. Is there blood in the urine or could there be some other heme pigment? 2. If there is blood in the urine, is it coming from the glomerulus? 3. If it is not coming from the glomerulus, where is it coming from?

Differential diagnosis of hematuria. Microscopy following a positive urinalysis aids in diagnosis. 1PNH = paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a disorder characterized by hemolysis. LEUKOCYTURIA (PYURIA) The presence of white cells in the urine is known as leukocyturia. This may be associated with inflammation anywhere in the urinary tract and can occur in the presence of hematuria (eg glomerulonephritis) or as isolated pyuria. Diagnosis. Leukocytosis is initially detected on urinalysis (dipstick) by the presence of leucocyte esterase. Nitrite positivity on the dipstick suggests the presence of organisms that can convert nitrate to nitrite. A urine culture is often performed to determine the presence of a urinary tract infection, and to identify antibiotic sensitivities (minimum inhibitory concentrations). Urine microscopy is 10  10 \\n often checked when urine cultures are negative. The presence of white cell casts is diagnostic of inflammation in the kidney (glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, or interstitial nephritis). Sterile pyuria is the presence of pyuria with negative urine cultures. This may be due to an infection such as TB, or due to the non-infectious causes of leukocyturia. Causes of Leukocyturia 1. Urinary tract infection: This may be lower urinary tract (cystitis, prostatitis) URINE CASTS Tamm Horsfall protein secreted in the distal nephron may solidify and form a cast (mold) of the inside of the tubule.

Describe the typical course of diabetic kidney disease. Recognize the features and complications of nephrotic syndrome. Differentiate features of nephritis from nephrotic syndrome. Differentiate glomerular hematuria from non-glomerular hematuria. Diagnose the common causes of glomerular disease. INTRODUCTION TO GLOMERULAR DISEASE Each kidney contains approximately one million glomeruli. The glomerulus comprises a series of capillary loops which function to filter water and other small molecules from the blood while restricting passage of large molecules such as protein. There are four glomerular cell types: mesangial cells, glomerular endothelial cells, podocytes (also called visceral epithelial cells) and parietal epithelial cells. Injury to mesangial or endothelial cells, which are in direct contact with the blood (containing leukocytes, complement, inflammatory proteins), typically leads to inflammatory renal disease, or nephritis (Figure 11.1). By contrast, podocytes lie on the outside of the glomerular capillary and are separated from the circulation by the thick glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Podocyte injury usually does not lead to leukocyte recruitment and inflammation, but rather disrupts the glomerular filtration barrier leading to proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome. EPIDEMIOLOGY OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE Diseases of the glomerulus are the most common causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide. In the United States, the major glomerular diseases causing ESRD include diabetic kidney disease (~50%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis the US, glomerulonephritis is by far the leading cause of ESRD.It is estimated that only 10% to 20% of patients with glomerulonephritis show clinical symptoms; thus, the prevalence of glomerular diseases may be underestimated. IgA nephropathy. Outside of (FSGS) and CPR-Renal Chapter 11 1 \\nCLINICAL PRESENTATIONS OF GLOMERULAR DISEASE ETIOLOGY Glomerular disease is typically divided into nephritis and nephrotic syndrome, but there can be significant overlap between these two presentations (Figure 11.1, Table 11.1).

Recall that glomerular hematuria can be distinguished from non-glomerular hematuria via urinalysis & urine sediment (Table 11.2). Non-glomerular Hematuria Normal shaped RBC\\'s Absence of casts Minimal proteinuria (<500 mg/24 hr) Lower urinary tract symptoms / UTI Table 11.2. Comparison of glomerular and non-glomerular hematuria Glomerular Hematuria Dysmorphic red cells Red cell casts Proteinuria NEPHROTIC SYNDROME Nephrotic syndrome results from a breakdown in the glomerular filtration barrier, such that large amounts of protein are filtered and delivered to the proximal tubule. Resorptive processes are overwhelmed, resulting in the spillage of protein in the urine (>3.5 g/ 24 h). Although glomerular injury can be severe in diseases causing nephrotic syndrome, it is unusual for patients to present with a decrease in renal function early in the course of disease. A rise in the serum creatinine level is instead usually a feature of more advanced disease. In contrast with the \"active\" urinary sediment in glomerulonephritis (Table 11.3), the urinary sediment of nephrotic syndrome is often devoid of red and white cells or casts (\"inactive\"). However, some patients present with an overlap nephritic-nephrotic picture with an active urinary sediment. Heavy proteinuria (> 3.5 g/24 hr) Hypoalbuminemia (< 3 g/dL) Peripheral edema Hyperlipidemia (elevated total and LDL cholesterol) Lipiduria (oval fat bodies in urinary sediment). There are 5 classical features of nephrotic syndrome: Manifestations and Complications of Nephrotic Syndrome 1. Hypoalbuminemia & Edema. In most cases, edema appears to result from a primary defect in Na+ excretion (eg glomerular disease or increased Na+ reabsorption in the CCD) leading to an expanded plasma volume. In the setting of low oncotic pressure, fluid accumulates (overfill theory, Chapter 4). Less commonly, hypoalbuminemia may decrease the plasma oncotic pressure resulting in decreased EABV and RAAS activation, leading to Na+ retention (underfill theory). 2. Hyperlipidemia. Hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein synthesis are increased in nephrotic patients, likely in response to decreased oncotic pressure. Decreased catabolism also partly explains the increase in levels of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). 3. Lipiduria. Following glomerular filtration of lipoproteins, lipids may be taken up by proximal epithelial tubular cells (PTEC). Detached PTEC containing lipid may be seen in the urine as oval fat bodies, or as lipid containing granular casts (fatty casts). 4. Thrombosis. Hypercoagulability results from increased hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors (eg fibrinogen) and urinary loss of regulatory factors (anti-thrombin III, protein C and protein S). Thrombosis may be exacerbated diuretic induced hemoconcentration. Renal vein thrombosis complicates all forms of nephrotic syndrome (especially membranous nephropathy) and may be asymptomatic or present acutely as a sudden decrease in renal function, loin pain, hematuria, or even systemic emboli. 5. Infection. Increased susceptibility to infection (especially by gram positive bacteria) is caused by urinary losses of IgG and complement, but also by impaired cellular immunity. 6. Bone disease: Urinary loss of vitamin D binding protein may lead to vitamin D deficiency. Treatment with steroids may exacerbate bone loss. Table 11.3.

Treat the underlying secondary cause. eg tumor in membranous nephropathy DISEASES PRESENTING AS NEPHROTIC SYNDROME The etiology of nephrotic syndrome is divided into primary and secondary causes (Table 11.1). The most common primary glomerular diseases that cause nephrotic syndrome in adults are FSGS, membranous nephropathy, minimal change disease, and MPGN.Although these disease entities are usually primary (and idiopathic), each can also be secondary to an underlying systemic disease. Notably, the glomerular histology is often indistinguishable between primary and secondary forms. Diabetes mellitus and amyloidosis are the leading secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome. Minimal Change Disease Minimal change disease is most commonly a disease of children, but is also described in adults, when it may be more resistant to treatment. Pathogenesis. Minimal change disease occurs as a result of a reversible podocyte injury, possibly due to a T-cell mediated cytokine or anti-nephrin antibodies. Secondary forms are rare (eg Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma, lithium use). Clinical Presentation. Usually presents with rapid onset nephrotic syndrome with normal renal function, although acute kidney injury may occur in adults. Renal Biopsy. This disorder is called minimal change because on light microscopy the renal biopsy essentially looks normal (Figure 11.2). Immunofluorescence is negative. Diffuse effacement (flattening) of podocyte foot processes is the key finding and is seen only by EM.a b Figure 11.2. Microscopy of Minimal Change Disease. a) Glomerular light microscopy appears normal. b) Electron microscopy reveals characteristic diffuse effacement of podocyte foot processes. CPR-Renal Chapter 11 5 \\n Treatment. Minimal change disease responds to high dose steroids. A child presenting with nephrotic syndrome is empirically treated as having minimal change disease. Further evaluation (eg kidney biopsy) is only performed if the treatment does not work. Adults usually respond to steroids, but typically more slowly; steroid resistance is more common, and secondary agents such as cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate are used. Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) FSGS is a descriptive term: focal (< 50% glomeruli involved), segmental (only part of glomerular tuft), glomerulosclerosis (thickening and fibrosis within glomerulus). FSGS may be an idiopathic disease similar to minimal change disease (but more resistant to therapy), may be genetic (due to mutations in genes encoding certain podocyte proteins), or may be the result of glomerular hypertension and hyperfiltration injury secondary to nephron loss (Figure 11.3). The disease is becoming more common, and FSGS is the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome among African Americans. Etiology. Obesity is an increasingly common cause of FSGS.A severe form of FSGS is found in HIV infected patients called collapsing glomerulopathy (aka HIV associated nephropathy, or HIVAN - see below). Causes of FSGS Primary Idiopathic circulating glomerular permeability factor Genetic mutations in podocyte protiens Secondary Reduced renal mass (low birth weight) Glomerular HTN (obesity, HTN) hyperfiltration Drugs (lithium, steroids) Viral (HIV, parvo B19) podocyte damage Figure 11.3. Etiology of FSGS.FSGS has primary and secondary causes, and treatment varies significantly. Pathogenesis. Like minimal change disease, FSGS occurs as a result of a podocyte injury. In contrast to FSGS, the podocyte injury is more severe leading to podocyte loss (which have little regenerative capacity) leading to scarring. Clinical Presentation. Primary FSGS presents similarly to minimal change disease, with abrupt onset severe nephrotic syndrome. Initial renal function is normal, but progressive reduction in GFR is common. Secondary FSGS is a less severe condition, with lower levels of proteinuria, often sub-nephrotic, and slower progression. 6  11 \\n Renal Biopsy. Many glomeruli look normal, but with scarring (sclerosis) of portions (segmental) of the glomerular tuft (Figure 11.4). Immunofluorescence studies are negative. By electron microscopy, podocytes show effacement of their foot processes similar to minimal change disease. Therefore, the finding of segmental sclerosis by light microscopy is needed to diagnose FSGS and distinguish it from from minimal change disease. a b b the addition of other Figure 11.4. Microscopy of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis. a) Light microscopy reveals partially normal glomeruli with segmental sclerosis. b) Foot process effacement is seen on EM.Treatment: Primary FSGS is treated with prolonged high dose steroids, and may require (cyclosporin, immunosuppressant agents mycophenolate). By contrast, secondary FSGS does not to respond immunosuppression. All forms of FSGS are treated with blood pressure control, ACEI/ARBs, control of hyperlipidemia, and treatment of cardiovascular risk. HIV-Associated Nephropathy (HIVAN) Uncontrolled HIV infection can cause severe kidney injury termed HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). This encompasses a severe form of FSGS (collapsing glomerulopathy) and diffuse atrophy of the tubules and tissue fibrosis. Clinically, patients may present with nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Highly active anti- retroviral therapy (HAART) has markedly decreased the incidence of this disease. Membranous Nephropathy Membranous nephropathy (MN) derives its name from the characteristic thickening of the GBM seen on light microscopy. MN is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in Caucasian adults and is the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in people over the age of 60. In adults, 80% of cases are idiopathic. CPR-Renal Chapter 11 7 \\nPathogenesis: Primary MN is due to the development of antibodies to podocyte foot process proteins (eg phospholipase A2 receptor in primary MN) resulting in the in situ formation of immune complexes in the sub-epithelial space. Complement activation leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9), which injures the podocyte, resulting in increased extracellular matrix protein accumulation and basement membrane thickening. Secondary Causes. 20% of MN cases are from secondary causes. The most common secondary causes are SLE, and hepatitis B infection. In patients > 50, malignancy underlies 20% of all cases. Therefore, a diagnosis of secondary MN in this patient population requires age-appropriate cancer screening. Clinical Presentation: Patients present with nephrotic syndrome, and may have evidence of secondary causes (eg lupus, malignancy). Hematuria occurs in 50% of patients, and hypertension in 30%. While all diseases that cause nephrotic range proteinuria can lead to renal vein thrombosis, MN has the highest incidence of this complication. Renal Biopsy. Finding on light microscopy include thickening of the GBM with \"spike\" formation. By immunofluorescence, there are numerous immune deposits in the glomerular capillary walls. By electron microscopy, the immune complexes are located beneath podocytes (subepithelial) which themselves show extensive effacement of their podocytes (Figure 11.5). Treatment: Secondary causes should be identified, and complications of nephrotic syndrome should be treated. In those at higher risk of progression, immunosuppression consists of rituximab, tacrolimus or cyclophosphamide. Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) DKD is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in industrialized nations. Approximately 30-40% of patients with T1DM and 10-20% of patients with T2DM develop nephropathy, but as T2DM is much more prevalent, the majority of patients with DKD have T2DM.Pathogenesis. Multiple factors contribute to the development of DKD including hyperglycemia, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), renal hyperfiltration, and activation of the RAAS.Studies have shown that tight glucose control reduces the incidence of DKD.8  11 \\na c b d Figure 11.5 Microscopy of Membranous Nephropathy. a) Jones silver stain reveals thickened capillary loops on light microscopy as well as b) capillary wall \"spikes.\" c) By immunofluorescence, IgG, C3, and kappa/lambda light chains deposits are observed along the capillary walls. d) On EM, subepithelial immune deposits are observed, with effaced podocyte foot processes. Clinical Course. One of the earliest changes in DKD is an increase in GFR or hyperfiltration, which is paralleled by an increase in renal size (organomegaly). The next change is the development of microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/d). Persistent microalbuminuria in glomerular structure/permeability and is referred to as incipient nephropathy. Patients with persistent microalbuminuria are at risk for developing overt nephropathy (defined by macroalbuminuria (>300 mg/d)). Overt nephropathy may then progress to nephrotic range proteinuria, hypertension and progressive renal insufficiency (end- stage renal disease). Clinically, renal complications develop an average of 15-20 years after the onset of diabetes. (Figure 11.6) is associated with changes CPR-Renal Chapter 11 9 \\nFigure 11.6. Typical time course of DKD.Renal complications typically develop 15-20 years after the onset of diabetes. Renal Biopsy. The hallmark of diabetic glomerulopathy is mesangial cell expansion, predominantly caused by an increase in mesangial matrix but also due to increased numbers of mesangial cells (Figure 11.7). Ultimately this may lead to the development of characteristic Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules on light microscopy. Extra-renal manifestations. DKD has microvascular and macrovascular complications: 1. Microvascular: Diabetic retinopathy is present in virtually all patients with T1DM and overt nephropathy. In contrast, only 50%-60% of proteinuric patients with T2DM have diabetic retinopathy. Many patients with DKD also have peripheral neuropathy. Other consequences include autonomic neuropathy (gastroparesis, orthostatic hypotension, erectile dysfunction and incomplete bladder emptying). 2. Macrovascular: Major cardiovascular complications include stroke, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease. Diabetes and chronic kidney disease are significant cardiovascular risk factors and the vast majority of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease die before ever reaching ESRD.Diagnosis. Most patients with nephrotic syndrome and diabetes do not undergo kidney biopsy to confirm DKD.Rather, biopsy is only performed in subjects who do not fit the typical clinical course (e.g., sudden onset disease, active urine sediment, absence of retinopathy, rapid worsening of renal function, etc.) Screening. Patients with diabetes are screened for DKD by checking first morning void albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) and measurement of serum creatinine (eGFR). Both tests should be done at the time of diagnosis of T2DM, 5 years after the diagnosis of T1DM, and annually thereafter. Positive tests must be reconfirmed (2 out of 3 positive tests is considered a positive screen). 10  11 \\nTreatment. Prevention and treatment of DKD require a multifactorial approach: 1. Glycemic control plays a critical role. Recent data have highlighted the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors. 2. ACE/ARB use is crucial in patients who are hypertensive or who have albuminuria. The target blood pressure is lower in patients with diabetes than in the general population (<130/80 mm Hg). 3. Cardiovascular protection with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") and aspirin prophylaxis have been shown to a have a beneficial effect. 4. NSAID avoidance and smoking cessation are highly recommended. Other nephrotoxic medications should also be avoided. Figure 11.7.

Pathogenesis. Amyloidosis is caused by the deposition of an abnormal protein material (amyloid) in the extracellular tissue of the kidney and other organs. Amyloid consists of a combination of proteins: 1. Circulating Protein Serum Amyloid P (SAP) is found in all types of amyloid. 2. The 2nd protein component depends on the type of amyloid. Classification of Amyloid 1. AL amyloid: is a plasma cell disorder in which monoclonal light chains (typically lambda>kappa) are deposited, with SAP in tissues. 2. AA amyloid: Formerly known as secondary amyloid, AA amyloid occurs in chronic inflammation (eg rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\\'s, chronic infection, TB, etc.). Serum amyloid A is deposited with SAP.3. Atypical amyloid: Rarely, other circulating proteins are deposited with SAP.Clinical Presentation. Heavy nephrotic syndrome is typical of amyloidosis. Deposition of amyloid can occur in many tissues, but commonly causes macroglossia, cardiomyopathy, GI symptoms, carpal tunnel syndrome, and neurological disorders. Features of the chronic inflammatory process (eg bronchiectasis) may be present in AA amyloid. The prognosis is often poor from combination of severe nephrotic syndrome and the underlying cause. Renal Biopsy: Deposition of amyloid is seen as an amorphous hyaline material in glomeruli and vessels (Figure 11.8). A Congo red stain can be performed - this stains amyloid deposits orange. When these deposits are viewed under polarized light, they exhibit an apple-green hue. By electron microscopy, the amyloid deposits are composed of randomly oriented non-branching fibrils ~10nm in diameter. Treatment. Specific treatment is aimed at the underlying cause of the amyloid. b dexamethasone and melphalan) 1. AL amyloid: Treatment is directed at the plasma cell disorder (eg c 2.

GLOMERULONEPHRITIS (\"Nephritis\") The clinical features of nephritis typically are caused by acute inflammatory injury to the glomeruli. The clinical characteristics include hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, and increased creatinine levels. The decrease in glomerular filtration in nephritis causes salt and water retention, leading to hypertension and edema, and can also cause hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. Hematuria in nephritis may be visible to the naked eye (ie macroscopic or gross hematuria) or only detectable under the microscope or with a dipstick (ie microscopic hematuria). Dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts in the urine (\"active urinary sediment\") are pathognomonic for glomerulonephritis. Proteinuria in nephritis is generally less than 3.5 g/24 hr, in contrast to nephrotic syndrome. Post-infectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) This is typically a self-limiting disease that develops after a pharyngeal infection or skin infection (e.g., impetigo) with nephritogenic strains of streptococci, though it may occur less commonly with other bacterial or viral infections, especially staphylococcus. PIGN most often affects children 2 to 10 years of age. CPR-Renal Chapter 11 13 \\nPathogenesis. PIGN is an immune complex-mediated form of glomerulonephritis. The immune complexes comprise a combination of antigen from the infectious agent and host antibody, with complement proteins. The formation of immune complexes explains the typical 2- to 3-week delay between streptococcal infection and the onset of PIGN.Clinical Presentation. Patients usually present following a bacterial (classically streptococcal) infection. There is a latent phase between the initiating pharyngitis (mean of 10 days) or skin infection (mean of 21 days) and the onset of nephritis. Patients present with dark, smoky or \"cola-colored\" urine containing RBCs and RBC casts. They may have edema (can be pronounced), diminished urine output, and signs and symptoms of hypertension. Renal function is often normal. Proteinuria is typically less than 1000 mg/day. Throat and skin cultures are usually negative, but serologic measures of recent streptococcal infection, such as antistreptolysin O, are elevated, and remain so for 3 to 6 months. Activation of the alternate pathway of complement leads to low levels of CH50 and C3, but normal C4. Renal Biopsy. Light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy all reveal characteristic changes in PIGN (Figure 11.9): a b c Figure 11.9. Microscopy of post-infectious glomerular nephritis. a) By light microscopy there is a marked influx of neutrophils into the glomerular capillaries. b) Immunofluorescence demonstrates deposition of IgG and C3 both in the mesangial regions and in the capillary walls. c) Electron microscopy shows large subepithelial immune complex deposits (\"subepithelial humps\"). 14  11 \\nTreatment. There is no role for antibiotic therapy in PIGN, because the inciting infection has typically occurred weeks prior and the antigen-antibody complexes have already formed. Treatment is therefore supportive. The majority (> 95%) of patients recover normal renal function. IgA Nephropathy IgA nephropathy derives its name from the glomerular deposition of IgA, which causes an inflammatory response. IgA nephropathy is the most prevalent glomerulonephritis in developed countries. Pathogenesis. Mesangial cell injury in IgA nephropathy results from the deposition of IgA, partly due to under-glycosylation of the IgA molecule, impairing the ability of the liver to clear these molecules from the circulation. Clinical Presentation. IgA nephropathy may present as episodic macroscopic hematuria, asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, active nephritis, or rarely RPGN.Episodic macroscopic hematuria is the classical presentation of IgA nephropathy and may occur within 24 hours after a mucosal infection (often upper respiratory tract). This differs from the delayed-onset hematuria that appears 2 to 3 weeks after pharyngitis in PIGN.Microhematuria, low-grade proteinuria and progressive renal dysfunction may occur. Renal Biopsy. Characteristic changes are observed via light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (Figure 11.10). Treatment. ACE inhibitors, even in normotensive patients, may slow progression by lowering glomerular filtration pressure and reducing proteinuria. In patients with progressive IgA nephropathy, immunosuppression is often considered with a 6- month course of oral steroids. Fish oil therapy may be helpful in some. c CPR-Renal Chapter 11 15 \\na b in Figure 11.10. Microscopy of IgA nephropathy. a) IgA immune deposits accumulate the mesangium causing mesangial cell proliferation and occasionally crescents as seen on light microscopy with b) predominant IgA staining on immunofluorescence. c) Mesangial immune deposits are seen as electron densities on electron microscopy. IgA Vasculitis [Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP)] IgAV is a systemic vasculitis characterized by deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes in tissues and is considered by some to be a systemic manifestation of IgA nephropathy. IgAV is manifested clinically by a classic tetrad of purpuric rash (typically over the extremities), arthralgias (in knees and ankles), abdominal pain, and renal disease. Most IgAV cases occur in children less than 10 years old, often without kidney involvement. Kidney disease tends to be more severe in adults. Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis (MPGN) MPGN is an immune complex-mediated glomerular disease that can present as nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or a combined nephritic-nephrotic syndrome. The name derives from the classical finding of splitting of the basement membrane (due to accumulation of immune deposits) and the proliferation of mesangial and endothelial cells. By itself, MPGN is a non-specific pattern of glomerular injury and requires thorough clinical evaluation for possible causes/etiologies. Etiology: MPGN in developed countries it is most commonly associated with hepatitis C, (SLE) or paraproteinemia. Less frequent causes also include bacterial endocarditis or 16  11 infections, autoimmune disease rarely other \\nchronic abscess. A MPGN pattern of injury may also been seen with C3 glomerulopathy, a rare disorder of the alternate pathway of complement activation. Pathogenesis: Deposition of immunoglobulins (usually IgG and/or IgM) and complement (usually C3; sometimes C1q if related to lupus) within the mesangial and subendothelial regions cause injury and inflammation with subsequent remodeling. Clinical Presentation. MPGN presents with nephritis, but proteinuria is often heavy, and may present with overlap features of nephritic / nephrotic syndromes. Patients with hepatitis C may also have evidence of a cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (e.g., weakness, arthralgia, purpura). Investigations reveal low complement levels, and patients may be hepatitis C positive with or without cryoglobulins. Renal biopsy. Subendothelial and mesangial immune complex deposits are seen in light microscopy (Figure 11.11). Depending on the etiology (see above) immunofluorescence microscopy shows deposits containing IgG and/or IgM and complement C3 (typical pattern for hepatitis C MPGN). Electron microscopy usually confirms the location of the deposits and the extent of basement membrane remodeling. a b Figure 11.11. Microscopy of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. a) immune deposition results in mesangial cell proliferation and an influx of inflammatory cells. b) Classical double contouring of the GBM (so-called \"tram tracks\") is a result of interposition of cells and/or immune deposits in the capillary wall, with synthesis of new basement membrane material. Treatment and Prognosis. Hepatitis C-associated MPGN with cryoglobulinemia is usually treated with anti-viral therapy. Steroids and rituximab are sometimes used to suppress the immune response if glomerular inflammation is very severe. CPR-Renal Chapter 11 17 \\nLupus Nephritis Lupus nephritis is a systemic disease, typically affecting young females ages 15 to 40, that commonly presents with renal abnormalities / nephritis. Cerebral and renal involvement by lupus is associated with a more aggressive clinical course. Pathogenesis. This glomerulonephritis is often due to the tissue deposition of immune complexes consisting of nuclear antigens and anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) that activate the classical complement pathway leading to inflammation and tissue injury. Clinical Features. Systemic features are often prominent (malar rash, joint pains, alopecia, mouth ulcers) at presentation. Lupus nephritis (LN) can have a wide range of clinical presentations which correlate with pathologic findings on kidney biopsy. This can range from asymptomatic hematuria (Class I & II) to active glomerulonephritis / RPGN (Class III & IV) to nephrotic syndrome (Class V). The disease is often diagnosed by the finding of positive ANA, and anti-double stranded DNA antibodies. There may be prominent hypocomplementemia of both C3 and C4 (Class III & IV). Renal Biopsy. By light microscopy, glomerulonephritis may manifest as mesangial expansion/hypercellularity, (endocapillary hypercellularity), large immune deposits (\"wire loops\", hyaline thrombi), necrosis and/or crescent formation (Figure 11.12). In membranous forms of LN, the capillary walls appear thickened. By immunofluorescence microscopy, there is \"full house\" (poker terminology for 3 of a kind - IgG, IgA, IgM + 2 of a kind - C3, C1q) immune complex deposition in the glomeruli. Electron microscopy reveals numerous mesangial, subendothelial and even subepithelial immune deposits. a inflammatory cells influx of b Figure 11.12. Microscopy of lupus nephritis. a) Light microcopy reveals a proliferative glomerulonephritis (similar to MPGN) and large immune deposits may sometimes be seen (\"wire loops\" & hyaline thrombi). b) Immunofluorescence is strongly positive for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C1q (\"full house\"). Treatment: The acute glomerulonephritis and RPGN presentations require heavy immunosuppression (high dose steroids + high dose mycophenolate mofetil or 18  11 \\ncyclophosphamide). Class V has a less aggressive presentation, but is often similarly treated with steroid and mycophenolate, albeit at more moderate doses. Hereditary Nephritis / Alport Syndrome This (most commonly) X-linked disease is due to mutations in the alpha5 chain of type IV collagen, a major constituent of the GBM.Alport syndrome often presents in adolescent males with hematuria and renal dysfunction and is often associated with deafness and retinal abnormalities. Renal biopsy reveals thickened and uneven GBM on electron microscopy (Figure 11.13). Thin Basement Membrane Disease This is a fairly common condition (~ 1% of the population) and is often familial with autosomal dominant transmission. 50% of cases are due to heterozygous mutations in genes encoding type IV collagen proteins (COL4A3, COL4A4). It usually leads to microhematuria with dysmorphic red cells, but is often considered benign as it rarely leads to renal dysfunction. Renal biopsy reveals thin GBM on electron microscopy (Figure 11.6). a b Figure 11.13. Electron microscopy of a) hereditary nephritis and b) thin basement membrane disease. a) An irregularly laminated \"basket weave\" glomerular basement membrane is characteristic of heredity nephritis (Alport syndrome). b) Thin basement membranes. Note that normal basement membrane thickness is >250 nm. RAPIDLY PROGREssIVE GLOMERULONEPHRITIS (RPGN) RPGN is a clinical definition of marked worsening in serum creatinine level over 3 months due to an underlying glomerulonephritis. Frequently, renal function deteriorates over as little as days or weeks. RPGN requires urgent therapy. RPGN can occur as a primary renal disorder or as a consequence of systemic disease. Conventionally, RPGN is classified according to the underlying disease mechanism into one of three categories (Table 11.4). CPR-Renal Chapter 11 19 \\n Table 11.4. Classification of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Mechanism Antibody Mediated Anti-GBM disease (Goodpasture\\'s) Underlying Disease ANCA associated Pauci-immune Immune complex Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) Eosinophilic granulomatosis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) Lupus Henoch Schonlein purpura Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) Disease Epidemiology. Anti-GBM disease is a rare disease most commonly affecting males in either the 2nd-3rd or the 6th-7th decades of life, though it may affect both males and females of all ages. Exposure to pulmonary toxins, such as hydrocarbons, and smoking, increase the incidence of anti-GBM disease. Pathogenesis. Anti-GBM disease is caused by an antibody directed against an epitope on the a3 chain of type IV collagen in the GBM.Type IV collagen is also found in the alveolar basement membrane of the lung, so these antibodies may also result in pulmonary disease. The term \"anti-GBM disease\" is used if the disorder is restricted to the kidney; Goodpasture\\'s syndrome refers to the combination of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage associated with circulating anti-GBM antibodies. Clinical Presentation. The typical presentation is RPGN with an active urinary sediment, with or without the complications of pulmonary hemorrhage (pulmonary renal syndrome). Renal biopsy. Characteristic findings on light microscopy include glomerular necrosis (Figure 11.14). Smooth linear staining of IgG and C3 along the GBM is pathognomonic for anti-GBM disease. Treatment and Prognosis. Patients with anti-GBM disease require urgent therapy to prevent an irreversible decline in renal function. The treatment of choice is triple therapy, consisting of plasmapheresis, prednisone and cyclophosphamide. Plasmapheresis removes the circulating anti-GBM antibodies and other mediators of inflammation, while prednisone and cyclophosphamide minimize new antibody formation. 20  11 \\na b Figure 11.14. Microscopy of Anti-GBM Disease. a) Light microscopy reveals diffuse necrotizing lesions and crescents in more than 50% of glomeruli. b) Immunofluorescence reveals linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the GBM.ANCA-associated Small Vessel Vasculitis (SVV) This is a group of multi-system disorders that can rapidly destroy kidney function, but can respond very well to immunosuppression if diagnosed at an early stage. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyarteritis (MPA) are the two most common diseases in this group. Their features, biopsy and treatment are very similar and they are described together. ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) are autoantibodies directed at neutrophils and are found in 90% of patients with SVV.They have been divided into cANCA (cytoplasmic) and pANCA (perinuclear) on the basis of staining artifact produced by ethanol fixation (Figure 11.15). cANCA (cytoplasmic, usually directed against proteinase 3 (PR-3)). This is more typically associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). pANCA (peri-nuclear, usually directed against myeloperoxidase (MPO)). This is more typically associated with microscopic polyarteritis (MPA) or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome). Pathogenesis. These diseases are considered pauci-immune as there are few immune complexes or IgG seen on the renal biopsy. At early stages, neutrophil mediated injury of the vascular endothelium (vasculitis) leads to acute inflammation and progresses to tissue ischemia. ANCA may play a central role in activating neutrophils. Necrosis and breakdown of the glomerular capillary leads to macrophages & T cells spilling into Bowman\\'s space and crescent formation. Clinical Features. Kidney involvement presents with an RPGN, but the kidneys are not always involved in these multi-system disorders. Lung involvement, possibly with pulmonary hemorrhage is another common feature. The combination of pulmonary hemorrhage and acute glomerulonephritis is known as a pulmonary CPR-Renal Chapter 11 21 \\nrenal syndrome. Other common features include petechial skin rash, nasal congestion, sinusitis, scleritis, deafness, myalgias, mononeuritis and marked fatigue. Renal Biopsy. The presence of glomerular crescents (Figure 11.15) on renal biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis of SVV.Notably, immune complexes are uncommon (hence, pauci-immune). a b c Figure 11.15. Microscopy of ANCA-associated SVV.a) Light microscopy reveals necrotizing glomerulonephritis with the formation of crescents in Bowman\\'s space. Though immune complexes are uncommon, autoantibody staining may reveal b) pANCA or c) cANCA depending on the location of staining within neutrophils. Treatment: Early diagnosis and treatment is vital. Intense immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide/rituximab and prednisone may be successful. 22  11 \\nureteral stone that fails to pass with observation NEPHROLITHIASIS Epidemiology of Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones) Chapter 12 Nephrolithiasis (Kidney Stones) Author: Jonathan Harper OBJECTIVES: At the end if this chapter, the student should be able to: Describe the risk factors for the common types of kidney stones Contrast differences between the clinical presentation of acute renal colic versus an acute abdomen Recognize 3 clinical situations that warrant urgent decompression of a ureteral stone Describe medications that may help medical expulsion therapy of a distal ureteral stone Describe medical management to prevent the development of calcium stones Describe 2 common surgical techniques to manage a renal stone and a Prevalence is ~ 9% in the US (11% in males, 7% in females) Incidence has increased in the past 20-30 years, with higher incidence in economically developed countries. Most common age of onset is in 30s-50s, but may occur at any age, including childhood $2 billion spent on treatment each year in the USA.  Recurrence is common; recurrence rate approaches 50% at 10 years. Figure 12.1. The \"Kidney Stone Belt.\" In the US, the highest incidence of kidney stones is in the southeastern region (in red). This is thought to be due to, in part, increased temperatures and humidity leading to dehydration. Diet may also play a role.  12 1 \\nFactors Influencing Stone Formation Increased renal excretion of ions contributes to super-saturation of urine with solutes (typically Ca2+, oxalate, and uric acid), promoting stone formation. Dehydration also contributes to nucleation (initial crystal formation). Upon nucleation, the stone undergoes aggregation and grows further. In addition, \"stone inhibitors\" are often low in patients who form stones. Inhibitors of stone formation include: citrate (most important), Mg2+, Tamm- Horsfall protein, and other glycoproteins. Other risk factors influencing stone formation include: Male sex (1.3:1 ratio) Family history of nephrolithiasis Low urine volume (hot climate, low fluid intake) Dietary factors: o High animal protein intake o High Na+ intake o Oxalate-rich diet o Very high or very low Ca2+ intake Metabolic abnormalities: hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, hyperoxaluria, Urinary tract infection (UTI): certain bacteria increase the risk for struvite (magnesium ammonium infection stones hypocitraturia calculi also known as phosphate) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Calcium Oxalate Stones 75-85% of all stones are calcium-based stones. Stones are most often calcium oxalate (CaOx) or mixed with calcium phosphate. It is thought that CaOx stones form from an initial calcium phosphate concretion near the renal calyx epithelium in the terminal collecting duct. This concretion (also known as Randall\\'s plaque) erodes through the urothelium, forming a nidus for CaOx deposition over time. Factors that promote CaOx supersaturation include: Dehydration (low urine volume) Hypercalciuria Hyperoxaluria Hyperuricosuria Hypocitraturia 1. Hypercalciuria: Excess calcium in the urine is typically due to renal wasting from a failure to reclaim calcium in the distal convoluted tubule. Less 2  12 \\ncommonly, primary hyperparathyroidism, and acidemia lead to bone demineralization and excess calcium in the urine. 2. Hyperoxaluria: Hyperoxaluria has enteric, dietary, and primary etiologies: Enteric. Malabsorption disorders such as Crohn\\'s, small bowel resection, and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass all cause increased intestinal oxalate absorption. Non-saponified fatty acids bind Ca2+, and less free Ca2+ is available to bind oxalate in bowel lumen. Unbound oxalate is then absorbed. Dietary. Oxalate is found in very high amounts in spinach, beets, swiss chard, nuts, chocolate, black tea, berries, rhubarb, and soy products. Primary. Primary hyperoxaluria is a rare, inherited disorder. 3. Hyperuricosuria Uric acid may act as a nidus for CaOx stones (see uric acid stones below). 4. Hypocitraturia Citrate inhibits CaOx and calcium phosphate stone formation by competing for binding with urinary Ca2+, decreasing the free Ca2+ available for crystallization to oxalate or phosphate. Hypocitraturia may be an idiopathic but also may be less commonly associated chronic diarrhea, and any systemic acidemia including renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Prevention of Calcium Oxalate Stones General Measures for all stones: Increase fluid intake (goal: urine output >2 L/day) Restriction of animal protein (1-1.5 g/kg per day) Salt restriction (2-3 g/day) Specific Therapies: Hypercalciuria (thiazide diuretics).Note that dietary Ca2+ restriction is not recommended, as oxalate absorption increases. Hyperoxaluria - low oxalate diet, Ca2+ supplementation (eg CaCO3) with food to bind oxalate in GI tract Hyperuricemia - allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor) Hypocitraturia - Citrate replacement (Lemon-based therapy or oral potassium citrate) Uric Acid Stones 10% of all stones are uric acid stones, which are seen predominantly in patients with increased purine dietary intake (meat), acid urine and dehydration. Uric acid stones are also seen in patients with obesity, gout, and myeloproliferative disorders. Cancer and/or cancer therapy may also result in uric acid stone, due to tumor lysis syndrome. Uric acid stones are the only stones that can be dissolved, through alkalinization of the urine.  12 3 \\nTumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a potentially life-threatening complication of cancer and cancer therapy at any age. TLS represents a constellation of metabolic abnormalities that may be spontaneous in some high turnover tumors. More commonly, TLS results from treatment-related tumor necrosis. Metabolic abnormalities observed in patients with TLS include hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. These abnormalities can lead to kidney stones, and in some cases, acute kidney injury due to intra-renal obstruction. Acidic urine (pH < 5.5) is the primary contributor to the formation of uric acid stones; uric acid is 100X more soluble at pH > 6 as compared to pH < 5.5. Prevention of uric acid stones includes: Restriction of dietary protein intake Urine alkalinization with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate (goal pH higher than 6.5) Allopurinol is a second line treatment. Struvite Stones Struvite stones represent <10% of kidney stones. They are more common in females and are composed of Mg2+, NH4 3- (triple phosphate stones). Urinary (Proteus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella) are a common cause of struvite stones as urease +, alkalinizing the urine. These stones are typically large, cleaves urea in NH4 can recur quickly, and often lead to recurrent urinary tract infections. Treatment includes: infections with urease-producing organisms + and PO4 tract Early surgical referral for removal of stones and stone fragments Appropriate antibiotic therapy Cystine Stones Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired proximal tubular reabsorption of cystine and other dibasic amino acids ornithine, arginine, and lysine. The increased cystine excretion results in nephrolithiasis. These stones are rare, accounting for only 1-2% of cases. Hexagonal crystals are visible in the urine, which are pathognomonic of cystine stones (Figure 12.2). Prevention of cystine stones involves maintaining urine cystine concentration below 300 mg/L, which includes: Vigorous fluid intake Urine alkalinization Na+ Oral thiol binders (2-mercaptopropionylglcyine, penicillamine), though restriction these medications have many side effects. 4  12 \\nrecessive disorder characterized by Note that cystinuria is a different disorder from cystinosis. Cystinosis is an autosomal intracellular cysteine accumulation. Cystinosis is a cause of Fanconi syndrome (a proximal renal tubular acidosis) and progressive renal failure. Cystinosis does NOT result in kidney stones. a c b d Figure 12.2. Urine Crystals. a) Calcium oxalate crystals (envelopes). b) Uric acid crystals. c) Struvite crystals (coffin lids) d) Pathognomonic cystine crystals (hexagons) Indinavir Stones Indinavir is a protease inhibitor used as part of a regimen in patients with HIV.10- 30% of patients taking indinavir form kidney stones. Protease inhibitor stones are the only human stone not visible on non-contrast CT, but can be diagnosed by history alone. These stones typically pass with hydration (and temporarily stopping the protease inhibitor). EVALUATION OF KIDNEY STONES The complexity of the evaluation depends on how many stones the patient has previously passed. Because the rate of recurrence is variable, a limited evaluation after a first stone may be sufficient. After the first kidney stone, the recommended initial evaluation includes:  12 5 \\n1. History: age at first stone, significant medical history, and family history 2. Medication History: Vitamin C, Vitamin D, acetazolamide, and antacids all may increase likelihood of calcium stones Salicylates, thiazides, and probenecid may increase risk of uric acid stones Indinavir, triamterene, and acyclovir may precipitate in the urinary tract, and form stones themselves.   Topiramate can mimic RTA type 1 3. Diet History: low fluid, high salt, high protein, excess calcium, calcium restriction, or excess oxalate may all increase risk of stones 4. Laboratory Evaluation: Serum electrolytes, HCO3, creatinine, uric acid, calcium, intact PTH (optional), may be helpful. Urinalysis and culture if history of infections Stone analysis (if available) Patients with recurrent stones warrant further metabolic evaluation: 1. 24-hour urine (Stone panel). A 24-hour urine collection is useful to determine the metabolic etiology of stone formation. Urine volume, pH, calcium, oxalate, sodium, uric acid, citrate, phosphate, magnesium, sulfate, creatinine, and quantitative cystine (optional) may be helpful. 2. Laboratory evaluation. Serum electrolytes, HCO3, creatinine, uric acid, calcium, intact PTH may be helpful. Low HCO3 and K+ may suggest RTA CLINICAL PRESENTATION Pain The classic presentation of a kidney stone is sudden, colicky flank pain that radiates to the groin, scrotum, or labia. Pain is often precipitated by passage of a stone from renal pelvis to ureter with resultant obstruction. The location of obstruction can often lead to specific patterns of pain: Renal calyx stones may cause intermittent obstruction, leading to dull aching in back/flank. Renal pelvis/ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) stones typically bring on severe deep pain at the costovertebral angle (CVA) that radiates to flank and associated upper abdominal quadrant. Upper and mid ureteral stones often cause pain overlying the stone with severe, sharp back/flank pain. 6  12 \\n  Distal ureteral stones may cause lower quadrant pain along with urinary urgency, frequency, and dysuria. Nausea/vomiting and/or blood in the urine may also be present. Physical Exam Patients are usually in obvious pain, and are constantly adjusting position (in contrast to patients with peritonitis, who lie still with a rigid abdomen). CVA tenderness is common. Vital signs are usually normal, but tachycardia may be seen. Caution is warranted if the patient looks ill and is febrile, tachycardic, or hypotensive, as they may have an obstructing stone with sepsis. This clinical scenario warrants immediate urological consultation. It should be noted that kidney stones are often asymptomatic, and may be found as an incidental finding on imaging. Differential diagnosis of flank pain Other causes of flank pain should be excluded. The differential diagnosis includes: Renal or ureteral stone Hydronephrosis (UPJ obstruction, sloughed papilla, ureteral tumor, etc.) Pyelonephritis Acute abdomen o Pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis diverticulitis of the colon (gall bladder), appendicitis, o Acute abdominal aortic aneurysm or ruptured aortic aneurysm Gynecologic (ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion or rupture) Radicular pain (Musculoskeletal pain, Herpes zoster) Referred pain (orchitis, testicular torsion) DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION 1. Laboratory tests. Serum chemistries (and creatinine) are usually normal CBC: Leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) may be present Urinalysis: Hematuria (gross or microscopic) is seen in 85-90% of cases. 2. Imaging studies. Plain Radiograph (KUB - Kidneys, Ureter, Bladder). A radiograph can identify radio-opaque stones (Ca-based, struvite, cysteine) but not uric acid stones, which are radiolucent. They may miss small stones or those overlying bony structures, but can be used to follow known visible stones. Because they miss many stones, they are considered inadequate for initial diagnosis.  12 7 \\nNon-contrast CT scan. This is the gold standard study for stone detection with 95% sensitivity and 98% specificity for detecting stones (Figure 12.3). It is a fast study and can detect the extent of urinary tract obstruction and allow examination of other organs and pathology. Contrast dye is not necessary to reveal radiolucent stones (e.g., uric acid) and the degree of ureteral obstruction. Only indinavir stones cannot be detected by this method. Figure 12.3. Non-contrast CT Scan. The visible kidney stone is denoted by white arrows. Ultrasound. Ultrasound (US) can detect many stones and does not expose the patient to radiation, but its sensitivity for detecting stones is low (~24%). It may be used in patients where radiation exposure should be avoided (children, pregnancy). MANAGEMENT Spontaneous Stone Passage The spontaneous passage of stones depends on its size, location and anatomy. Stones < 4 mm in diameter located in the lower ureter have a 80-90% change of passing while stones > 6 mm in diameter have 5-10% chance of passing spontaneously. Spontaneous passage also depends on stone location: Proximal ureteral stones (above SI joint) pass 15% of the time Mid-ureteral stones (all along the SI joint) pass 25% of the time Distal ureteral stones (below the sacrum) pass 50% of the time. Pain Control Both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and narcotics work well for pain; NSAIDs are preferred initially, as they can help decrease ureteral spasm as well. When compared to opiates, NSAIDs have shown equal or greater efficacy for pain relief with fewer side effects in most randomized studies. However, they 8  12 \\nmay contribute to renal dysfunction in a kidney that already may be experiencing decreased blood flow due to obstruction. Expectant Management When urgent intervention is not necessary, the patient can be managed as an outpatient with oral analgesics with plans to follow-up with their primary provider or a urologist. Alpha blockers may facilitate the passage of ureteral stones (referred to as medical expulsive therapy). Clinically, tamsulosin (an alpha blocker) is used most commonly. Patients should be instructed to strain their urine and bring in the stone for analysis. Indications for Urgent Intervention A urologist should be called to urgently evaluate any patient with any of the following indications: Obstructed upper tract with infection (suspected based on the presence of fever, leukocytosis, or urinalysis with pyuria and/or bacteriuria). Impending renal deterioration (eg high-grade obstruction in a solitary or transplanted kidney) Pain refractory to analgesics Uncontrolled nausea/vomiting Infection in the setting of obstruction is an emergency, and mandates emergency drainage!! Referral to a urologist for outpatient (ie less urgent) evaluation include stones >5 mm in size, stones that have not passed by 2-4 weeks, multiple stones, or recurrent stones. Medical Treatment Medical dissolution therapy may be attempted in patients with known uric acid calculi by alkalinizing the urine (potassium or sodium citrate, sodium bicarbonate) Surgical Treatment The optimal surgical approach depends on the size/location of the stones and the experience of the urologist. Options include: Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). SWL is often used for stones (<1.5 cm) located in the kidney or proximal ureter without significant obstruction. Ureteroscopic treatment by laser lithotripsy and/or basket extraction. With this method, stones can be utilized throughout the entire urinary tract. Stones are fragmented under direct vision to dust and tiny fragments. Afterwards, a temporary ureteral stent is often required. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). PCNL is a more invasive treatment option that involves direct access into the kidney through the 9  12 \\nback. A needle passed through the skin into the kidney creates access that is then dilated to 24 Fr (8 mm diameter) to place equipment for stone removal. Although PCNL is more invasive, it is recommended for many large stones (> 2cm). Figure 11.4. PCNL.Through an access sheath, the surgeon inserts a fiberoptic scope to either remove the stone or break it up into tiny pieces using a laser, ultrasound probe, or pneumatic device. Describe the prevalence of hypertension and the global burden of disease. Recognize the consequences of uncontrolled blood pressure. Differentiate between primary and secondary hypertension Discuss the pathophysiology & risk factors for primary hypertension Describe how aging affects systolic versus diastolic hypertension. Describe the correct technique and cuffs necessary for accurate blood pressure assessment. Hypertension (HTN) is the most common diagnosis made in the primary care setting. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-14), the prevalence of HTN (by criteria >130/80) in adults is 46%, but this markedly increases with age: at age 55-64 the prevalence is 70%; at age 75-84, 79%. In addition, the prevalence of pediatric hypertension has increased since the 1980s and is currently estimated to be ~3.5%. Worldwide prevalence of hypertension may be more than one billion individuals, and approximately 10 million deaths per year can be attributed to hypertension. Suboptimal blood pressure is the number one attributable risk for death throughout the world (ref. Global brief on hypertension, WHO 2013). Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, heart disease and kidney disease. Clinical trials have shown that anti-hypertensive therapy reduces the incidence of stroke (by 35-40%), myocardial infarction (20-25%) and heart failure (50%). BLOOD PREssURE Systemic arterial blood pressure (BP) is the pressure exerted by the blood on the arterial walls and is produced by contraction of the left ventricle against the resistance of the arteries and arterioles. Systolic BP occurs during left ventricular systole and is mostly due to blood flow from ventricular contraction, whereas diastolic BP occurs during ventricular relaxation (diastole) and is maintained by aortic recoil. Pulse pressure is the difference between systolic and diastolic BP. Recall that blood pressure is determined by the cardiac output and total peripheral (systemic vascular) resistance. Stroke volume is determined by the intravascular volume (ECV) and by myocardial contractility. Regulation of ECV is described in Chapter 4. Briefly, this includes Na+ intake, GFR, RAAS activity, SNS activation, and natriuretic peptides. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is regulated by the balance of vasoconstrictors (angiotensin II, endothelin 1, SNS/norepinephrine etc.) and vasodilators (nitric oxide, prostaglandins, bradykinin, etc.). SVR also increases with stiffening of blood vessels due to atherosclerosis, fibrosis or calcification. In the management of hypertension, it is useful to consider the underlying physiology in an individual patient to help guide anti-hypertensive therapy (Chapter 14). Normal Variation in Blood Pressure Diurnal variation. Normally, mean arterial pressure falls by 10-20 mm Hg during sleep due to a decrease in sympathetic activity. Loss of this nighttime drop (\"non- dippers\") has been associated with increased left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiovascular disease. White coat hypertension. Home BP measures are generally 5-10 mm Hg lower than in the doctor\\'s office. Some patients have normal BP at home but elevated levels when measured in the clinical care setting. This is labeled white coat hypertension and accounts for ~25% of mild HTN measured in the office. Masked hypertension. The opposite is possible, with high home BP readings and normal office BP.This is called masked hypertension. Patients with masked hypertension seem to have the same cardiovascular risks as sustained hypertension. Note that 24hr blood pressure monitoring may be useful if there is a question about the accuracy of BP office readings (eg borderline HTN or white coat HTN). Most studies suggest that 24hr BP correlates better with adverse outcomes than office BP. To ensure an accurate blood pressure reading: the patient should avoid caffeine, smoking, or any adrenergic; the patient should sit with their back supported and two feet on the; the width of the cuff should be at least 40% of the circumference of the patient\\'s upper arm, and the length of the bladder should be 80% the length of the upper arm. New American College of Cardiology Guidelines for 2017 have defined hypertension as > 130/80, or a systolic blood pressure at or above 130 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure at or above 80 mm Hg (Table 13.1.) 4. The patient\\'s upper arm should be positioned at heart level and Table 13.1. Classification of blood pressure in adults (2017) BP Classification* Normal** Elevated BP Stage 1 Hypertension State 2 Hypertension *Blood pressure must be measured as the average of two or more readings at two or more visits, after an initial screen. **Note that \"normal,\" \"elevated,\" \"stage 1 HTN,\" and \"stage 2 HTN\" are defined differently for the pediatric population. See Pediatrics Sep 2017, 140 (3). DBP (mm Hg) and < 80 and < 80 or 80-89 or > 90 SBP (mm Hg) < 120 120-129 130-139 > 140 Elevated Blood Pressure Elevated BP is defined at 120-129/<80. Patients with this borderline blood pressure are at high risk of progressing to HTN.Note that normal blood pressure values are on a spectrum. A BP of 90/60 may be normal in a 25 year-old medical student, and a BP of 128/78 would be elevated for that student. Essential (Primary) Hypertension Essential hypertension is an out of date term referring to a discredited theory that increased blood pressure was essential for perfusion of organs through narrowed atherosclerotic vessels. Clinical trials have subsequently shown that lowering blood pressure reduces mortality without affecting organ perfusion and the term primary hypertension is preferred for BP > 130/80. The age of onset for primary hypertension is typically in the 40s. Hypertensive Urgency Hypertensive urgency is defined as severe HTN (systolic BP >180 and/or diastolic BP > 120 mm Hg) in patients who are asymptomatic. A hypertensive emergency refers to severe HTN (systolic BP >180 and/or diastolic BP > 120 mm Hg) with evidence of end-organ damage (eyes, brain, heart, kidney). This was previously called malignant hypertension as it was usually fatal before the introduction of good anti-hypertensive medications. It is often associated with papilledema and acute confusion secondary to cerebral edema (hypertensive encephalopathy). Resistant Hypertension A BP of >130/80 on 3 different classes of blood pressure medications, one of which is a diuretic, is termed resistant hypertension. ETIOLOGY Risk Factors for Hypertension Age. Hypertension is more common with aging. Factors responsible for this include increased arterial stiffness (which may lead to isolated systolic HTN or increased pulse pressure). Arterial stiffness can be assessed by pulse wave velocity studies. Other factors related aging include decreased nitric oxide availability, increased angiotensin II and increased pro-inflammatory factors. Obesity is associated with increased hypertension. Increased leptin secreted by adipocytes contributes to increased SNS activity and Na+ retention. Adipocytes also secrete mineralocorticoid-releasing factor, stimulating the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone. Obesity is also a risk factor for diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea. Note that the increasing prevalence of HTN in the pediatric population may be in part attributed to a rise in the prevalence of childhood obesity. Diabetes. Both hyperglycemia (\\xadSNS, \\xad arterial stiffness, other) and hyperinsulinemia (\\xadNa+ retention) contribute to hypertension. There is an association of prematurity / low birth weight with the development of HTN in later years (termed the Barker Hypothesis). In utero kidney development is not complete until 36 weeks, and prior to this, impaired kidney development may lead to reduced nephron number, with hypertension and CKD in later life. Hypertension is typically a polygenic disorder and is 2X more common with a family history of HTN.Some rare monogenic forms of HTN are recognized, often related to renal handling of Na+ o Liddle syndrome. Activating mutations in epithelial Na channel (ENaC) in the cortical collecting duct enhance Na reabsorption. A high salt intake may expand the ECV and promote hypertension. Salt may also promote blood vessel fibrosis (via TGF-beta) and amplify local vasoconstrictors (angiotensin II and endothelin). This is defined as an increase in BP of 10 mm Hg or more with salt loading. Some subjects have greater BP responses to higher salt intake. This is more commonly seen in subjects who are older, obese, or have diabetes or kidney disease. tubule, stimulates SNS activation. Activation of the SNS promotes Na+ retention in the proximal renal vasoconstriction. Note that the kidney itself can also be a source of sympathetic activity. Intrarenal baroreceptors and chemoreceptors may stimulate the SNS via renal afferent nerves, leading to HTN.Studies are investigating the role of renal denervation in the management of resistant HTN.the RAAS and stimulates Lifestyle Factors Salt. This will exacerbate HTN, but is not sufficient to cause HTN by itself. Alcohol. Excess alcohol use is associated with hypertension. Smoking. Nicotine is a vasoconstrictor. Caffeine. Associated with acute rises in BP, but not chronic HTN or cardiovascular disease. Medications. A number of medications are associated with hypertension including NSAIDs, estrogen containing contraceptives, decongestants (pseudoephedrine), steroids, and erythropoietin. Drugs. Drugs that cause vasoconstriction or activate the SNS are associated with HTN (eg cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy). SECONDARY FORMS OF HYPERTENSION Although 80-90% of hypertension is primary, secondary causes of hypertension are potentially curable and should be investigated. Clues to the presence secondary hypertension include an onset at young age (<30yrs) or older age (>65yrs) (primary HTN usually starts in the 40\\'s), resistant hypertension, hypokalemia or clinical features related to the secondary disorder itself (eg bruits, tachycardia etc.). Kidney disease CKD is the most common secondary cause of hypertension, but HTN may also occur in some forms of AKI (eg acute glomerulonephritis). Mechanisms of HTN in kidney disease include: sodium retention, activation of the renin angiotensin system, SNS activity, arterial stiffness (may be related to high PO4 level / vessel calcification). Renal artery stenosis leads to a decrease in renal perfusion sensed by intrarenal baroreceptors, activating the RAAS and leading to high renin hypertension. In older patients this is usually due to atherosclerotic renal disease, whereas in younger patients it may be due to fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Renal artery stenosis may present acutely with severe HTN or \"flash\" pulmonary edema. Chronically, it may present with HTN, CKD and unequal sized kidneys on renal ultrasound. Treatment. Renovascular HTN responds well to ACEIs or ARBs which block the RAAS.If the stenosis is bilateral, these agents must be used with care, however, as the reduction in glomerular pressure may lead to acute kidney injury. Definitive treatment with angioplasty and stenting may be considered for FMD, but is often less successful for atherosclerotic renal artery disease. Endocrine Causes Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn\\'s syndrome). This is a relatively common cause of resistant hypertension often missed in clinical practice. Binding of aldosterone to the mineralocorticoid receptor in the CCD enhance Na+ reabsorption (via ENaC) and K+ excretion (see Chapter 6). The HTN may be associated with hypokalemia (~50%). Aldosterone can also cause vasoconstriction and enhance vascular/cardiac fibrosis. Primary hyperaldosteronism may be due to bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or an adrenal adenoma. A high serum aldosterone: renin ratio is a good screening test for this condition (Table 13.2). Treatment includes blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (spironolactone / eplerenone) or in the case of adrenal adenoma, laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Cushing\\'s syndrome. Cortisol is usually converted to corticosterone by the protective 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Excess cortisol may overwhelm this enzyme and the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol may then lead to hypertension. Associated glucocorticoid features may include central obesity, muscle weakness, abdominal striae, easy bruising, glucose intolerance, and osteoporosis. Pheochromocytoma. A pheochromocytoma is typically a benign tumor leading to overproduction of catecholamines. Most cases are sporadic, but 10% are familial. Clinical features may include intermittent HTN associated with sweating, palpitations, headache, panic, and pallor. Thyroid disorders. Hypertension is more common in both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Acromegaly. Excess growth hormone may be associated with HTN.6  13 \\nOther Causes 1. Obstructive Sleep Apnea. OSA is usually associated with obesity. HTN is partly due to increased SNS activity and Na+ retention. 2. Aortic Coarctation. Coarctation in young children may lead to HTN in upper extremities only. May present as a radio-femoral delay in pulse. Table 13.2.

This is termed target organ damage. Notably, hypertension accelerates the development of atherosclerosis, partly secondary to endothelial injury. Heart left ventricle Hypertensive heart disease hypertrophy. This leads to increased ventricular stiffness and may result in heart failure. Patients with hypertension are also at increased risk for accelerated coronary artery disease leading to myocardial infarction. Hypertension is also a risk factor for other vascular disease including peripheral arterial disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm.  13 is characterized by concentric 7 \\nBrain Hypertension is associated with increased risk of stroke, both cerebral infarcts and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The increased risk of infarcts is directly related to accelerated atherosclerosis of cerebral arteries leading to thrombosis or embolism of these vessels. Chronically, multi-infarct dementia may develop. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurs from small arteries that are exposed to the high blood pressures. Notably, ICH symptoms may be less acute and sub-maximal at onset, but worsen as the hematoma expands. Severe acute hypertension may result in cerebral edema reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Eyes The arterioles of the retina are sensitive to the effects of hypertension. Fundoscopy can identify features of hypertensive retinopathy. Grade 1: Arteriolar narrowing (silver wiring) and vascular tortuosities Grade 2: AV nicking Grade 3: Retinal edema, cotton wool spots and flame-shaped hemorrhages Grade 4: Swelling of the optic disc (papilledema) + macular star. Note that (hypertensive encephalopathy) or Posterior this is an emergent situation and is a feature of hypertensive emergency. Kidney The kidneys play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, but they are also commonly (hypertensive nephrosclerosis). This is characterized by small shrunken kidneys with a finely granular surface. The glomeruli show wrinkling and collapse of capillary loops leading to glomerulosclerosis, and the tubules become atrophic with the development of interstitial fibrosis. Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is the classic lesion. result of hypertension injured as a 8  13 \\n Figure 13.1. Clinical Consequences of Hypertension. Target organ damage may include injury to the heart (resulting in heart failure, MI); injury to the brain (resulting in hemorrhage, cerebral edema, and dementia); damage to the eyes (resulting in papilledema and blindness); and damage to the kidney (resulting in nephrosclerosis.)  13 9 \\n 10  13 \\nChapter 14 Treatment of Hypertension Author: Haya Jamali, Matthew Rivara, & Ashley Jefferson OBJECTIVES At the end of this chapter, the student will be able to: Describe lifestyle interventions in the treatment and prevention of hypertension. Describe the mechanism of action of the four main classes of drugs used to treat hypertension. Describe a clinical approach to choosing an antihypertensive medication. WHOM TO TREAT Hypertension is defined as BP > 130/80 on two or more office visits. This assumes that BP is measured accurately and that white coat hypertension has been excluded. 2017 ACC guidelines recommend a threshold for treatment of 130/80 in subjects for secondary prevention, or for primary prevention in patients with an atherosclerotic cardiovascular (ASCVD) risk > 10%. A more relaxed threshold of 140/90 is recommended for primary prevention in patients with an ASCVD score <10%. It should be recognized that blood pressure values are normally distributed throughout the population, and any value chosen as a cut-off is arbitrary. Those who are at highest cardiovascular risk or have target organ damage benefit the most from anti-hypertensive therapy. All patients should be advised regarding lifestyle interventions (Table 14.1). If hypertension persists, pharmacological therapy should be started. It is critical to consider and identify any secondary causes of hypertension (Chapter 13) as these may require specific treatment aimed at the underlying etiology. LIFESTYLE MEASURES Educating patients on the benefits of lifestyle measures is critical in the prevention and treatment of hypertension. Specific interventions are summarized in Table 14.1. It is well recognized that adherence to these lifestyle changes is difficult and ongoing education and reinforcement are required.  14 1 \\nHigh K+ diet Smoking cessation Decreased alcohol intake Decrease caffeine Comments BP drops by ~1mm Hg for each kg of weight loss Table 14.1. Lifestyle interventions in the treatment and prevention of hypertension Intervention Weight loss Increased physical activity Moderate exercise reduces BP by 2-3 mm Hg Na+ intake <1.5g per day reduces BP by 5-6 Low Na+ diet mm Hg K+ intake 3.5-5g per day reduces BP by 4-5 mm Hg Limit to 2 drinks per day for males, 1 drink for females Regular coffee drinking (<1-2 cups/day) does not increase chronic BP NSAIDs, estrogen containing contraceptives, decongestants, steroids, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy Avoid medications / drugs associated with HTN Diet and Hypertension Sodium Intake. In people with hypertension, the majority of studies show a low Na+ diet improves BP control. This is especially true for people with chronic kidney disease. All major societies currently recommend Na+ restriction as a component of BP management. Potassium Intake. A low K+ diet increases BP, whereas a high K+ diet or dietary K+ supplements lower BP.The mechanism is unclear but may relate to vasodilatation or renal Na+ handling. A high intake of fruit and vegetables as a dietary source of K+ is recommended. DASH diet. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial (DASH) showed a reduction in blood pressure of 5/3 mm Hg with the DASH diet over controls. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lowfat dairy and limits sodium, sugar, and alcohol. What to recommend. Clinically, patients are recommended to avoid processed or packaged food (high in Na+), and to avoid cooking with salt. Instead, fruits and vegetables are encouraged, as well as cooking with fresh ingredients. A dietician consult may be beneficial to provide detailed advice for select patients. 2  14 \\nPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT 2017 ACC Guidelines recommend thiazide diuretics, calcium antagonists and ACEIs or ARBs as appropriate first line therapies for the majority of patients. Classification of Anti-Hypertensive Agents Recall that arterial blood pressure is the product of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance (BP = CO x SVR). In primary hypertension, SVR is often elevated. In other cases, BP is mediated by volume expansion or by activation of the RAAS or sympathetic nervous system. Some drugs act principally by lowering SVR and others by lowering CO.The principal drugs will be discussed under four general headings (ABCD): Importantly, ACEIs have other beneficial effects in addition to lowering BP, including decreased fibrosis (heart, vessels, kidneys) and kidney protection (decreased glomerular filtration pressure). Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). There are two predominant angiotensin receptors (AT1R and AT2R subtypes). The AT1R is responsible for most of the cardiovascular and hypertension-related effects of angiotensin II.AT1R blockers (eg losartan) have many of the protective benefits of ACEI but have a decreased incidence of dry cough as they do not block bradykinin degradation.  14 3 1. Angiotensin Blockade 2. Beta-blockers (& other inhibitors of the SNS) 3. Calcium antagonists 4. Diuretics 1. Angiotensin Blockade (RAAS inhibitors) The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) is the major regulator of SVR via angiotensin II release, and of body Na+ and K+ content via aldosterone release. Pharmacologically, the RAAS can be blocked at four molecular sites. Clinical trials with drugs from this class have shown powerful reductions in target organ damage and mortality, especially in hypertensive patients with heart failure or diabetes. The major side effect from all of these medications is hyperkalemia. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). ACEIs (eg lisinopril) lower BP by two mechanisms: 1. Inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to active angiotensin II.This reduces vasoconstriction and decreases Na+ reabsorption both directly (in the proximal tubule) and via aldosterone action. 2. Inhibiting the breakdown of bradykinin (and other vasodilator peptides such as substance P). Bradykinin is responsible for some side effects including dry cough and angioedema in some patients. \\nNote that ACEIs or ARBs are the anti-hypertensive agents of choice in diabetes. In addition, use of these agents is contraindicated in pregnancy, and care must be taken in patients with renal artery stenosis and in advanced CKD (can lead to worsening renal function +/- hyperkalemia). Mineralocorticoid antagonists. Aldosterone antagonists (eg spironolactone, eplerenone) will antagonize the Na+ retaining effects of aldosterone and can be very effective anti-hypertensive agents, especially in seemingly resistant hypertension. Initially, it was expected that ACEIs would block aldosterone production, but in reality levels of aldosterone return to baseline levels after chronic therapy with ACEIs and ARBs (termed aldosterone escape). Because of their site of action in the kidney, these drugs are K+ sparing and the major toxicity is hyperkalemia. Direct renin inhibitors. The RAAS can also be blocked at the level of renin (eg aliskiren), but these agents are rarely used. They do reduce BP and proteinuria but have not been shown to lower the incidence of stroke, MI, or CHF like other antihypertensive agents. 2. Beta Blockers & Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) Inhibitors The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) controls the constriction of blood vessels (SVR) as well as the rate and force of the heart (CO). It also stimulates renin and augments Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule. SNS blockade may occur at different levels (CNS, the ganglia, nerve terminal or specific organ receptors). Beta antagonists (eg metoprolol) antagonize catecholamines at both beta1 and beta2 receptors and lower BP by two major mechanisms: (beta-blockers). beta-blockers 1. A decrease in cardiac output, resulting from inhibition of SNS-mediated stimulation of cardiac beta receptors (this is the major mechanism). 2. A decrease in plasma renin activity, caused by inhibition of SNS-mediated renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney. The principal toxicities result from inhibition of beta-adrenoceptor stimulation in the heart and lungs (eg exacerbating bradyarrhythmias such as AV block or exacerbation of bronchial constriction). beta-blockers vary in their selectivity and pharmacokinetics. beta-blockers can prolong life in patients who have coronary artery disease and/ or heart failure. When treating patients with beta- blockers, it is important to remember that chronic exposure to beta-blockers upregulates its receptor. If beta- blocker therapy is then suddenly stopped, this may lead to tachycardia. Dose titration should therefore be performed gradually. 4  14 \\nAlpha blockers (alpha1-antagonists). Alpha blockers (eg doxazosin, terazosin) selectively block alpha1 adrenoceptors, which are responsible for stimulating contraction of vascular smooth muscle. They are not used as monotherapy due to low potency. They have also not been shown to decrease cardiovascular events such as stroke or myocardial infarction. Their main toxicity is postural hypotension. Centrally acting agents (eg methyldopa and clonidine) lower blood pressure by stimulating alpha-2 adrenoceptors in the brainstem. These drugs share several toxicities unique to CNS-acting anti-hypertensives (including sedation and other CNS effects). Notably, sudden cessation of clonidine may result in severe rebound hypertension. This does not occur with methyldopa. 3. Calcium Antagonists & Vasodilators These drugs lower blood pressure by decreasing SVR and may produce a reflex stimulation of the SNS resulting in salt and water retention (via RAAS activation). They are often used in combination with other agents. Calcium channel blockers. Calcium channel blockers drugs lower blood pressure by blocking Ca2+ influx into vascular smooth muscle, relaxing blood vessels and lowering the SVR.These are often used as first line agents in used in patients with Na+ sensitive HTN, and in patients with angina or other vasospasm disorders. Dihydropyridines (eg nifedipine XL, amlodipine) are long acting agents widely used in hypertension with a good safety record. (Short acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have been associated with reflex tachycardia and reports of sudden death and are now rarely used). Non-dihydropyridines (eg verapamil, diltiazem) differ in their relative effects on vascular smooth muscle versus heart and CNS Ca2+ channels. These agents decrease SVR, but also have negative chronotropic effects (slowing the heart rate). They should be used with great caution in those on beta blockers and patients with heart failure or AV block. Other vasodilators include:  Hydralazine is a less potent arteriolar vasodilator (K+ channel activator). This drug is short acting and has been associated with drug induced lupus. Isosorbide mononitrate is more commonly used for angina, but also has anti-hypertensive properties.  3. Diuretics Diuretics inhibit Na+ reabsorption in the kidney and thus reduce the water retention that follows the Na+ uptake. Diuretics can produce at least a small lowering of blood pressure in any hypertensive patient, initially by lowering blood volume and later by lowering peripheral vascular resistance (PVR) or SVR via poorly understood  14 5 \\nmechanisms. Diuretics markedly potentiate the anti-hypertensive actions of other drugs, by blocking the normal compensatory retention of salt and water that occurs whenever BP is lowered. Note that salt restriction potentiates the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of diuretics. Thiazide diuretics. For the majority of cases of hypertension, thiazide diuretics (eg chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide) are more appropriate than loop diuretics. Thiazides exert a BP lowering effect at doses lower than needed for diuresis, have a long duration of action, and are orally available. The BP lowering effect reaches a plateau at doses lower than maximal natriuretic dose. Loop diuretics. Loop diuretics (eg furosemide, bumetanide) are more potent diuretics and may be more appropriate anti-hypertensive agents when a patient is clearly volume expanded. Potassium sparing diuretics. K+ sparing diuretics (eg amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone) are often used in addition to other diuretics as they help to balance the K+ loss. The major side effect of these diuretics is hyperkalemia. Other diuretics: Amiloride is less commonly used for hypertension. Triamterene is often used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide but may be associated with triamterene kidney stones. Choosing a Primary Antihypertensive Agent In the absence of any of the following clinical scenarios, current guidelines recommend ACEI/ ARB, CCB, or thiazide diuretics as first line therapies. A particular anti-hypertensive may be preferred in certain situations: 1. Proteinuric kidney disease (eg diabetic kidney disease (DKD)). An ACEI or ARB is the preferred initial therapy as this may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease to ESKD.Note that in DKD, usually 2-3 BP medications are required to achieve BP goals (<130/80). 2. Heart Failure. ACEI / ARBs are recommended as part of the therapy for heart failure. Note that spironolactone and beta-blockers are often used in this setting also. 3. Pregnancy (or those contemplating pregnancy). Many anti-hypertensive medications are contraindicated in pregnancy (especially those targeting the RAAS). Older agents such as methyldopa, labetalol and nifedipine are often used. 4. Hypertensive emergency. IV agents (eg IV nicardipine, IV labetalol, or sodium nitroprusside) are often required in the context of SBP >180 or DBP >120 with evidence of end organ damage such as encephalopathy, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, or aortic dissection. Note that BP should be 6  14 \\nlowered slowly by about 20% in the first hour, with a further reduction to ~160/100 over the next 2-6 hrs and the normal goal within 24-48 hrs. 5. Young patients. Young patients are more likely to have RAAS-mediated hypertension and may respond best to ACEI or ARB.Hypertension Treatment in Black Patients As discussed in Chapter 3, the use of race in clinical decision making is problematic, as race is a social construct and a poor proxy for genetic or biologic variation. The treatment of hypertension is another example of race-based medicine in which race has been falsely considered to be a biological variable. Older clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy stratified patients by demographic factors such as age and race. The current ACC hypertension guidelines recommend that initial first-line antihypertension treatment for all people include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs.1 They go on to say, \"In African American adults with hypertension but without heart failure or CKD, including those with diabetes mellitus, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB.\" This difference in recommendation stems primarily from the results of the ALLHAT trial of 33,000 patients with hypertension at high risk for a cardiac event.2 In this study, cardiac outcomes for individuals treated with chlorthalidone were similar to those for individuals treated with lisinopril or amlodipine; However, in Black patients, who comprised 35% of the study population, lisinopril was associated with a small, but statistically higher rate of stroke. However, this was based on a subgroup analysis of a secondary outcome, and some commentators have argued that this has had an outsized influence on hypertension guidelines. As in other areas of medicine, recent voices have advocated abandoning race-based selection of anti-hypertensive therapy in clinical care and future guidelines.3 Given the flaws of using race to inform treatment decisions, it is important to note that current prescribing patterns show that the types of antihypertensives prescribed are similar across all races4. It is not possible a priori to determine which blood pressure medication will be most effective for an individual patient. In treating patients without compelling indications for a specific class of antihypertensives, medication choices should be individualized and are often influenced by side effects and patient preferences. For example, a person with limited break time at work may find diuretics to be troublesome. A person with mild edema may be reluctant to try a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. To successfully treat hypertension, clear communication and engagement in shared decision making are essential. Key Principles of Anti-hypertensive Therapy 1. Hypertension is not one disease. A variety of underlying pathogenic mechanisms can lead to hypertension including volume expansion, RAAS activation, and SNS stimulation. 2. Multiple agents may be required. BP lowering by medications will evoke a compensatory reflex by the body (eg Na+ retention in response to a vasodilator), trying to restore the blood pressure to its prior set point. To counteract this compensatory reflex, a second medication is often needed (eg addition of diuretic to an ACEI). 3. Adherence may be challenging. One of the most important factors complicating the treatment of hypertension is patient adherence. As hypertension is often asymptomatic, patients may be reluctant to take lifelong daily medication. Patient education and support is extremely important, and agents with prolonged duration of action (\"once a day\") or combination pills may improve adherence.

What criticisms of the process do you have? Question 2: Kidney Transplant Candidates Today you are going to consider four candidates for kidney transplantation. Our medical center\\'s Multidisciplinary Selection Committee has evaluated their medical and surgical risk factors and determined that each individual stands to benefit from kidney transplantation. Your job is to determine who should get the next kidney available from the deceased donor pool. Please review the cases below. Donor Details: The donor was a 35 year-old, 88-kg person with no known past medical history who died as a result of an intracranial hemorrhage following a motor vehicle accident. Creatinine was 1.0 mg/dL (normal) on the day of death by neurologic criteria (\"brain death\"). Our medical center is offered one kidney graft. We have no concerns about the kidney quality and expect it could last more than 15 years. 1. Of the four cases, which candidate should receive this kidney transplant? 2. What is your justification for this decision? 3. What factors do you think should and should not be considered? 4. Can you identify whether these factors are based in principles of equity and/or utility? .............................................................................................................................. \\nMr Aguilar Age: 39 Renal History: He presented to a hospital with advanced renal failure and was immediately started on dialysis at age 24.

INTRODUCTION As you learned during the prior physiology and histology sessions, the kidneys function to remove metabolic wastes from the blood as urine, maintain electrolyte and water balances, and control blood pressure among other things. The basic functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which produces urine and drains into one of many collecting ducts to ultimately be funneled towards the ureter and empty into the bladder. Urine is stored in the bladder before being excreted through the urethra via the process of micturition (urination), a coordinated action involving contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the urethral sphincters. Together, the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra comprise the urinary tract (Figure 1). Figure 1. Overview of the urinary tract. The urethra is not pictured. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 1 \\nKIDNEY The kidney is shaped like a very large kidney bean roughly the size of a bar of soap (11-14 cm tall). The medial surface is concave and contains the hilum, a slit-like opening that allows for passage of the renal vasculature, renal pelvis, nerves, and lymphatics (Figure 2). At the hilum, the renal vein is anterior, renal pelvis is posterior, and renal artery is largely between the two (we will consider these structures in detail below). Figure 2. Exterior anatomy of the kidney. Right kidney shown. EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE KIDNEY The kidneys are retroperitoneal structures, meaning that they are located along the posterior abdominal wall posterior to the parietal layer of peritoneum (Figure 3). The peritoneum is the serous membrane that encloses the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen (like the pleura and pericardium enclose the pleural and pericardial cavities, respectively). We will explore the peritoneum and all of the intrA-and retroperitoneal abdominal viscera in the Energetics & Homeostasis block. The kidney itself is enclosed in a thin but strong fibrous capsule that adheres directly to its surface (Figures 2 & 3). The kidney is surrounded by layers of adipose tissue and fascia that provide support and cushioning. From the kidney outward, they are the perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat (Figure 3). The perirenal fat is directly external to the fibrous capsule and goes all the way around the kidney into the hilum (peri = around). The renal (or Gerota\\'s) fascia is a thin fibrous layer that separates the perirenal fat from pararenal fat. Pararenal fat is continuous with the extraperitoneal fat in the anterior abdominal wall seen in the MCBD block. Figure 3. Fat and fascia surrounding the kidneys. Right kidney pictured in sagittal section (posterior is to the left of the image). These fascial layers are also shown in the axial plane in Figure 9. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 2 \\nClinical correlate: The renal (Gerota\\'s) fascia is used as the surgical margin for radical nephrectomy in cases of renal carcinoma. Spread of the primary tumor to involve Gerota\\'s fascia puts adjacent organs at risk for further spread. While these layers provide support, they do not keep the kidneys rigidly in place. Instead, the kidneys move during respiration and with changes in body position. In the supine position, the left kidney rests at vertebral levels T12-L3. The right kidney rests lower at L1-L4 to accommodate the liver. At these levels, the posterior surface of each kidney is associated with four muscles of the posterior abdominal wall: psoas major, quadratus lumborum, and transversus abdominis behind the inferior portion and the diaphragm behind the superior portion (Figure 4). Both kidneys are crossed by the 12th rib; the relatively higher position of the left kidney means that it is also crossed by the 11th rib. The hilum of each kidney is at approximately the L1/2 vertebral level where the renal vasculature originates. Figure 4. Posterior relationships of the kidneys. Muscles of the posterior abdominal wall viewed from anterior on the left (kidneys outlined). Posterior view of the kidneys with related structures indicated on the right. The anterior relationships of the kidneys differ due to asymmetry of the abdominal viscera (Figure 5). Anterior to the left kidney are the stomach, spleen, tail of the pancreas, descending colon, and a portion of small intestine. Anterior to the right kidney are the liver, duodenum, and ascending colon. Figure 5. Anterior relationships of the kidneys. Liver, stomach, spleen, and colon removed to visualize the kidneys. The locations of these structures are also indicated on isolated kidneys (gray = small intestine). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 3 \\nThe suprarenal (adrenal) glands sit on the upper poles of both kidneys (see Figures 1 & 2). All of these abdominal relationships will be examined more completely in the Energetics & Homeostasis block. Clinical correlate: The anatomical relationships of the kidneys are clinically relevant as the kidneys may be approached either posteriorly or anteriorly during surgery and other procedures. The posterior retroperitoneal approach is common for needle biopsy of the kidney, avoiding the abdominal viscera in the peritoneal cavity (image shows ultrasound-guided renal biopsy, needle in the cortex of the kidney marked with a yellow arrow). The anterior transperitoneal approach is currently favored for living-donor transplant surgery as it has a quicker recovery period with less pain reported by donors. INTERNAL GROss ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY When the kidney is bisected along its long axis, obvious differences can be seen in its parenchyma (Figure 6). The cortex is the lighter outer region. The medulla consists of 7-14 cone-shaped pyramids deep to the cortex. Separating the pyramids of the medulla, the renal columns have the same make-up as the cortex. Recall from your prior session on renal physiology that most nephrons (about 85%) are cortical nephrons, meaning that all of their functional components are located in the cortex (except for maybe a small portion of the short loops of Henle; Figure 6). The remaining are juxtamedullary nephrons, meaning that their glomeruli are next to the medulla (still within the cortex) with the long loops of Henle extending into the adjacent pyramid. In addition to the long loops of Henle, the pyramids are composed of the collecting ducts that direct urine to the renal papilla at the apex of the medullary pyramid (Figure 6). Each papilla is nestled within its own minor calyx, where urine is drained. Several minor calices drain into one of two or three major calices. The major calices unite to form the renal pelvis, which exits through the hilum before draining into the ureter. The calices and renal pelvis are found within the renal sinus, the space deep to the hilum that also contains neurovasculature and perirenal fat. Figure 6. Interior anatomy of the kidney. Left kidney sectioned along its long axis through the hilum and viewed posteriorly (the renal pelvis is the most posterior vessel at the hilum). Inset shows portions of the nephron and collecting ducts in cortex and medulla (pyramid). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 4 \\nNEUROVASCULATURE OF THE KIDNEYS Arteries. The renal arteries branch from the abdominal aorta at vertebral level L1/2 and extend laterally towards the hila, which we have learned is approximately at this same vertebral level (Figures 7 & 8). Medial to the kidney, the renal artery begins branching into five segmental arteries that supply discrete vascular segments of the kidney (ie they do not anastomose), allowing for efficient filtration of blood and its return to the systemic circulation (Figure 7). For the purpose of connecting the dots between the segmental arteries and the nephron, blood progresses into the interlobar arteries between the pyramids, arcuate arteries at the base of the pyramids, and the interlobular arteries radiating into the cortex that branch into afferent arterioles to the capillaries of the glomeruli. Recall from the Anatomy & Embryology of the Urinary Tract syllabus that approximately 30% of the population has accessory renal arteries that persist after the kidneys \"ascend\" during development. Accessory renal arteries arise directly from the abdominal aorta and-like the segmental arteries-serve their own discrete vascular segment. Figure 7. Arteries of the kidneys. Partially dissected left kidney pictured. The discrete areas supplied by the segmental arteries are demonstrated above; you do not need to memorize the names of these segments. Clinical correlate: Renal artery stenosis-for example, from atherosclerosis (older patients) or fibromuscular dysplasia (young patients)-leads to decreased blood pressure in the kidney. This causes the kidney to release renin for vasoconstriction, leading to renovascular (or renal) hypertension. The image on the right shows stenosis of the right renal artery (yellow arrow) in an arteriogram. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 5 \\nVeins. The veins follow the reverse path out of the kidney before draining into the renal vein, which lies anterior to the renal artery (Figure 8). Both renal veins drain into the inferior vena cava. Due to the left- to-right shunting of venous blood during development, some asymmetries are present in the adult. Namely, the left renal vein is longer than the right. Lateral to where the left renal vein crosses the abdominal aorta, the left adrenal and left gonadal veins drain into it. Conversely, the right renal, adrenal, and gonadal veins each drain directly into the IVC.Figure 8. Vasculature of the kidneys. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is labeled where it relates to nutcracker syndrome (see clinical correlate below). Note how the ureters receive branches from the multiple arteries they cross on their path to the bladder. Clinical correlate: The left renal vein crosses over the abdominal aorta just inferior to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). If the angle between the SMA and the aorta decreases, the left renal vein will be compressed, resulting in renal vein entrapment syndrome, commonly referred to as nutcracker syndrome (the SMA and the aorta act as the nutcracker with the left renal vein being the \"nut\"). Compression of the left renal vein in this manner will prevent proper drainage of the kidney and the left gonad, a contributing factor that makes varicocele of the left pampiniform plexus more common than the right. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 6 \\nFigure 9. Axial CT of the abdomen at the L1/2 vertebral level. At this point in the curriculum, you should be comfortable deciphering what type of image you\\'re looking at (CT), what plane it\\'s in (axial), and orienting to left- right (patient\\'s right is on the left of image; notice the liver). You should be able to orient to radiodense (bone) and radiolucent (air/fat) structures. IV contrast has been added, which is enhancing the renal cortex and columns at this phase (contrast medium will continue through the kidneys to ultimately be excreted in the urine). Note the external relationships of the kidney, including the surrounding adipose and fascia layers (the renal fascia is barely visible as a faint white line between the leaders identifying the peri- and pararenal fat). The renal arteries and veins are shown at their L1/2 origins with the proximal SMA labeled where it relates to nutcracker syndrome. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 7 \\nNerves. Like all viscera, the kidneys are innervated by motor fibers from the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system and by visceral afferent sensory fibers. All three types of innervation travel in the renal plexus along the renal arteries (Figure 10). The sympathetic nervous system innervates the renal vasculature, all parts of the nephron, and the juxtaglomerular cells that secrete renin to play a role in regulating salt and water balance. By contrast, the role of parasympathetic innervation from CN x is unclear. Figure 10. Innervation of the kidneys. Sympathetic contributions to the aorticorenal ganglia from the lesser splanchnic nerves (T10-11) are labeled. Not shown are the least (T12) and lumbar (L1-2) splanchnic nerves. The two-neuron pathway for sympathetic innervation of the kidneys and ureter is slightly different from the canonical pathway we focused on in the MCBD block. Preganglionic sympathetic neurons that target the kidneys have cell bodies in the lateral horns of the spinal cord at levels T10-L2. Their axons do not synapse in the sympathetic chain ganglia, but instead continue in the lesser, least, and lumbar splanchnic nerves before synapsing on postganglionic neurons in the aorticorenal ganglia at the junction of the aorta and renal arteries (Figure 10). From there, postganglionic sympathetic neurons extend axons to targets in the kidney via the renal plexus along the renal arteries. Visceral afferents transmitting pain signals from the kidney and ureter travel with the sympathetic fibers back to spinal cord levels T10-L2, which leads to the pattern of referred pain from these structures (see clinical correlate). Clinical correlate: Pain from the kidneys and ureters (eg from kidney stones or upper urinary tract infection) can be felt diffusely across the T10-L2 dermatomes. Recall that the T10 dermatome is at the level of the umbilicus and that L1 is in the groin along the inguinal ligament. This diffuse pain in the back, sides, and anterior abdominal wall is often referred called flank pain. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 8 \\nLYMPHATIC DRAINAGE OF THE KIDNEY Lymph vessels draining the kidneys travel with the veins to drain into the para-aortic (also known as the retroperitoneal or lumbar) lymph nodes between the L1 and L5 vertebral levels (Figure 11). These nodes (which have more specific sub- classifications that you do not need to worry about at this time), connect to the cisterna chyli, which ascends posterior to the aorta to become the thoracic duct. Figure 11. Lymphatic drainage of the kidneys URETERS The ureters are vessels that transport urine toward the bladder by means of peristaltic contraction of the smooth muscle within their walls. The ureter has three parts: abdominal, pelvic, and intramural (Figure 12). The abdominal part starts superiorly at the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) between the renal pelvis and the ureter. From there, it descends retroperitoneally along the psoas major muscle. The pelvic part begins as the ureter passes over the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the common iliac vessels, entering the pelvic cavity (not to be confused with the renal pelvis). The intramural part begins as the ureter reaches the bladder at the ureterovesical junction (UVJ), continuing obliquely through the wall of the bladder (mural from the Latin for \"wall\") for 1-2 cm. The oblique course of the intramural part functions as a one-way valve that prevents vesicoureteral reflux of urine as the bladder fills and with contraction of the bladder wall during micturition. Figure 12. Ureter CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 9 \\nClinical correlate: Obstruction of the ureter (eg from nephrolithiasis or \"kidney stones\") commonly occurs at the ureteropelvic and ureterovesical junctions as well as the pelvic brim where the ureter crosses over the common iliac vessels. The image shows a kidney stone at the level of the right ureteropelvic junction (red arrow) that has disrupted normal kidney function on that side. The left side shows normal drainage of contrast into the renal pelvis (yellow arrow) and ureter (yellow arrowheads), in this intravenous pyelogram. Renal colic is a term used to describe the extreme pain from \"loin to groin\" (recall that visceral afferents from the ureter travel back to T10-L2) that is caused by ureteral obstruction. The ureter receives blood from the adjacent arteries along its course, including the abdominal aorta and renal, gonadal, common iliac, and internal iliac arteries (see Figures 7 & 8). The contributions from these arteries form a longitudinal, anastomosing chain that must be preserved during abdominal surgery to avoid ischemia of the ureter. URINARY BLADDER The bladder stores urine until it is convenient to excrete it through the process of micturition. The bladder is the most anterior visceral organ in the pelvis in both males and females (Figure 13). In females, the uterus and vagina are posterior to the bladder and the urethra. In males, the rectum (in addition to portions of the reproductive tract) is the primary posterior relationship of the bladder. The empty bladder resides in the pelvis and is shaped like a pyramid on its side (Figure 13). The curved posterior surface is the base or fundus. The apex is the anterior part that points towards the pubic symphysis. The large region between is the body. Urine is funneled inferiorly through the neck. As the bladder fills (the typical bladder can hold 300-600 mL of urine, about the volume of an average bottle of water), it expands superiorly above the pelvic brim and into the abdomen. This is important to consider in cases of abdominal penetrating injuries. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 10 Figure 13. External relationships and anatomy of the bladder \\nInternally, the mucosa of the bladder has a lot of rugae (from Latin for wrinkle) that stretch flat as it fills. The trigone is the smooth, elevated, triangular region on the internal aspect of the base of the bladder that was formed by incorporation of the mesonephric ducts (see Anatomy and Embryology of the Urinary Tract syllabus; Figure 14). The two superior corners of the trigone are the ureteric orifices. The inferior corner is the internal urethral orifice. Figure 14. Internal anatomy of the bladder URETHRA During micturition, the bladder forces urine through the urethra to the exterior. The male urethra also conducts semen during ejaculation. For now, we\\'ll consider the basics of the male and female urethrae with additional details to come in the Lifecycle & Reproduction block. In both males and females, the urethra begins at the internal urethral orifice and opens externally as the external urethral orifice (Figure 15). In females, the external urethral orifice is in the vestibule of the vagina anterior to the vaginal orifice (recall that the uterus and vagina are posterior to the bladder and urethra). In males, the urethra is approximately five times longer and is divided into three main parts: the prostatic, intermediate (or membranous), and spongy urethra. The external urethral orifice is at the termination of the spongy urethra in the glans penis. Figure 15. Comparison of female and male urethrae Clinical correlate: The female external urethral orifice lies relatively close to the anus and vagina, where bacteria naturally reside. In addition, the female urethra is comparatively short and straight, providing an easier route for bacteria to reach the bladder. These anatomical differences contribute to the much higher incidence of urinary tract infections in women vs men below the age of 50 (the male rate approaches the female in older patients).

CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Kidneys and Urinary Tract 12 \\n Triangles of the Neck INTRODUCTION The neck is a complex region that connects the head, thorax, and upper limbs. Innervation in the neck is a functional mix of somatic and autonomic as well as a structural mix of spinal and cranial nerves. In addition to blood vessels, the neck contains important passageways for air and food. All of these structures and more are crowded together in a relatively small region that underwent some unique embryonic development, adding twists and loops that don\\'t make a lot of sense without that context. We will cover the development of the head and neck in Energetics & Homeostasis as we cover the development of the digestive tract as a whole. For now, we will take a step back to make sense of the fundamental organization of the neck. Later in this chapter, we will cover the contents of the neck with particular focus on the blood vessels because they relate to the cardiac portion of this block. The pharynx, larynx, and trachea are covered in the next chapter. The esophagus is a topic in E&H.ORGANIZATION OF THE NECK The neck is composed of five compartments enclosed by fascial layers (Figure 1, Table 1). These fascial compartments keep structures together for coordinated muscle actions and provide passageways for neurovascular bundles. Depending on the specific space, these fascial layers may either confine an abscess or tumor or provide a route for the spread of infection or metastasis. These fascial layers may also offer surgical planes and barriers that protect neighboring structures from damage. Figure 1. Cervical fascia. Fascial layers and major contents are labeled. Inset shows compartments: blue = muscular, red = vertebral, purple = vascular, green = visceral, superficial not shown in inset.

The posterior cervical triangle (or just posterior triangle) is bounded by the SCM, trapezius, and middle 1/3 of the clavicle. The anterior cervical triangle (or just anterior triangle) is bounded by the SCM, midline, and lower border of the mandible. These triangles are further divided into sub-triangles that provide a means for compartmentalizing the complex relationship of structures in the neck. The remainder of this chapter will explore these two triangles and their sub-triangles beginning with the relatively simpler posterior triangle. Figure 2. Triangles of the neck. The larger posterior triangle (green) and anterior triangle (blue) can be further divided into the labeled sub-triangles. Important muscular and bony boundaries are also labeled.

CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 2 \\nPOSTERIOR TRIANGLE LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1. Describe the boundaries and contents of the posterior triangle of the neck. 2. 3. 4. 5. Identify the layers of cervical fascia in the posterior triangle. Identify the nerves and their divisions in the posterior triangle of the neck. Identify the deep muscles of the posterior triangle. Identify the vascular structures of the posterior triangle. OVERVIEW OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE As mentioned above, the posterior triangle is bounded by SCM, trapezius, and middle 1/3 of the clavicle (Figure 2). Its roof consists of the superficial fascia of the neck that contains the platysma muscle and the investing layer of deep fascia that encloses and spans the SCM and trapezius. Its floor is formed by the prevertebral fascia and the deep muscles of the neck that it overlies (see Figure 1). The posterior triangle is divided into two smaller triangles by the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle. The occipital triangle makes up the bulk of the posterior triangle. The supraclavicular triangle (also known as the subclavian or omoclavicular triangle) is the smaller inferior triangle. CONTENTS OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE In general, the posterior triangle primarily contains relatively small neurovasculature structures that are merely traveling through the area to reach targets elsewhere in the body. We will discuss the neurovasculature before we continue deep to the posterior triangle in order to understand the course of the major blood vessels in the area. SUPERFICIAL NEUROVASCULATURE The external jugular vein (EJV) crosses vertically over the middle portion of the SCM in the superficial fascia (Figure 3). It drains into the subclavian vein after passing through the supraclavicular triangle. The supraclavicular triangle also contains the supraclavicular lymph nodes. Clinical correlate: The supraclavicular lymph nodes on the left side are referred to as Virchow\\'s node. These nodes are located near the venous angle, where the thoracic duct drains lymph from the left upper quadrant and the entire lower body. A swollen Virchow\\'s node in the posterior triangle of the neck (red arrow) may be the first sign of gastric or intestinal carcinoma, cancers that can progress asymptomatically for long periods of time. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 3 \\nFigure 3. Posterior triangle. Roof of posterior triangle-investing fascia between SCM and trapezius-removed. The cutaneous branches of the cervical plexus travel through the posterior triangle as they course towards the areas of skin that they supply (Figure 3). They can be seen emerging from the posterior border of the SCM in a small region known as Erb\\'s point, which can be found near where the SCM is crossed by the EJV.The four nerves at Erb\\'s point are the lesser occipital, great auricular, transverse cervical, and supraclavicular nerves. These nerves receive contributions from C2-C4, which has consequences for referred pain (see clinical correlate below). NERVES IN THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE The phrenic nerve was covered in the Pericardium and Coronary Circulation chapter as the nerve that innervates the diaphragm with motor and sensory fibers. It originates from C3-5 (\"C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive\") and descends along the anterior surface of the anterior scalene muscle before entering the superior mediastinum (Figure 4). Clinical correlate: The overlap between the phrenic nerve (C3-5) and the cutaneous cervical plexus (C2-4) explains why pain from the diaphragm and the organs in close contact with it (eg liver) refers to the shoulder region. The spinal accessory nerve (or just accessory nerve), CN XI, is a cranial nerve that supplies motor fibers to the SCM and trapezius. It crosses the occipital triangle near the apex of the posterior triangle to reach the trapezius (Figure 3). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 4 \\nMUSCULAR FLOOR OF THE POSTERIOR TRIANGLE Recall that the prevertebral fascia forms the floor of the posterior triangle. The muscles that can be seen deep to this fascia help to form the floor. From superior to inferior, these muscles are the splenius capitis, levator scapulae, and posterior, middle, and anterior scalene muscles (covered with prevertebral fascia in Figure 3). The middle and anterior scalene muscles originate on the transverse processes of the lower cervical vertebrae. They both insert onto the 1st rib, the anterior slightly more anteriorly (Figure 4). The wedge- shaped gap between these two muscles and the first rib is referred to as the scalene (or interscalene) triangle. The scalene triangle allows for passage of the brachial plexus posteriorly and the subclavian artery anteriorly; the subclavian vein passes anterior to the anterior scalene outside of the scalene triangle. The brachial plexus is a complex structure that provides sensory and motor innervation to the upper limb. We will spend a lot of time covering the brachial plexus in the Musculoskeletal block. For now, we will focus on the subclavian artery and vein as they relate to the CPR block. Clinical correlate: Recall from MCBD that the thoracic inlet/outlet is formed by the 1st thoracic vertebra, 1st rib, and the manubrium of the sternum. Compression of the brachial plexus and/or the subclavian artery near the scalene triangle causes thoracic outlet syndrome. This may be caused by abnormalities that further crowd the already narrow passageway (such as an extra cervical rib) and will present with neural (pain, weakness) and/or vascular (pain, pallor, coolness) symptoms in the upper limb. Figure 4. Neurovasculature in and near the scalene triangle. Note that the sternum, SCM, infrahyoid muscles, and thyroid have been removed and other structures cut to provide a better view of the deeper structures near the scalene triangle. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 5 \\nARTERIES IN THE ROOT OF THE NECK AND POSTERIOR TRIANGLE The subclavian artery branches off the brachiocephalic artery on the right and directly off the arch of the aorta on the left. Both right and left subclavian arteries are divided into three parts relative to the anterior scalene (Figures 4 & 5). The 1st part is medial to the anterior scalene, the 2nd part is posterior to the anterior scalene in the scalene triangle, and the 3rd part is lateral to the anterior scalene. There are three branches of the 1st part of the subclavian artery. We have already seen the internal thoracic artery descending along the deep aspect of the anterior thoracic wall in the MCBD block. Recall that the anterior intercostal arteries branch off the internal thoracic artery. The vertebral artery ascends in the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae to supply blood to the brain. The thyrocervical trunk is the third branch of the 1st part of the subclavian artery. The thyrocervical trunk has four branches of its own: suprascapular, cervicodorsal, ascending cervical, and inferior thyroid arteries. The suprascapular artery travels towards the scapula directly behind the clavicle in the supraclavicular triangle. The cervicodorsal (or transverse cervical) artery is more superior, traveling posteriorly in the occipital triangle. The 2nd part of the subclavian has one branch, the costocervical trunk, which we will not emphasize. Figure 5. Subclavian artery and branches. Subclavian artery divided into 1st, 2nd, and 3rd parts. The 3rd part of the subclavian artery is directly associated with the posterior triangle and typically has no branches. The subclavian artery becomes the axillary artery as it passes the lateral border of the first rib. Clinical correlate: Subclavian steal syndrome involves unilateral stenosis or obstruction of the subclavian artery proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery, (yellow arrow) causing the ipsilateral upper limb to become ischemic. In this case, blood will flow up the contralateral vertebral artery through foramen magnum and reverse flow back down the ipsilateral vertebral artery to supply the limb (red arrows show pathway; note how the contrast fades along this path). Neurological symptoms from brainstem ischemia or stroke can result. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 6 \\nVEINS IN THE ROOT OF THE NECK AND POSTERIOR TRIANGLE The subclavian vein passes anterior to the anterior scalene and, therefore, does not pass through the scalene triangle (Figure 4). Recall that the EJV passes through the supraclavicular triangle to drain into the subclavian vein. Medial to the anterior scalene, the subclavian vein joins the internal jugular vein at the jugulosubclavian (or venous) angle to form the brachiocephalic vein. As discussed in the prior chapter, the venous angles are the sites where the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts drain on the left and right, respectively. Clinical correlate: The subclavian veins are commonly used for venous cannulation, both temporary and permanent (image shows subcutaneous port into right subclavian v and extending down into right atrium, yellow arrowheads). When placing a cannula into the subclavian vein, the subclavian artery is relatively protected by its deeper position and the separation provided by the anterior scalene. Recall from the MCBD block that the cupula of the lungs extends superior to the thoracic inlet into the neck and, therefore, pneumothorax is a possible complication of cannulating the subclavian vein.

Describe the boundaries of the anterior triangle, its fasciae, and its subdivisions. 2. Describe the muscles of the anterior triangle and their innervation. 3. Identify the contents of the carotid sheath and describe their relationships to structures of the thorax, neck, and head. 4. Describe the carotid bifurcation and the branches of the external carotid artery. 5. 6. Describe the lymphatic drainage of the neck. Identify the nerves and their branches found in the anterior triangle. OVERVIEW OF THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE Again, the boundaries of the anterior triangle are the SCM, midline, and lower border of the mandible (review Figure 2). The anterior triangle is further divided into four sub-triangles: submental, submandibular, muscular, and carotid. These triangles are separated by the hyoid bone and the digastric and omohyoid muscles (Figure 6). The hyoid bone has no articulations with other parts of the skeleton; it is suspended at approximately the C3 vertebral level by the muscles in the anterior triangle. It provides support for the tongue and is raised and lowered during swallowing. As the name suggests, the digastric muscle has two bellies-anterior and posterior-that are joined by an intermediate tendon at the hyoid bone (Figure 6). The anterior belly separates the submental and submandibular triangles while the posterior belly separates the submandibular and carotid triangles. The omohyoid also has two bellies (although its name does not suggest this), superior and inferior. Recall that the inferior belly separates the occipital and supraclavicular triangles in the posterior triangle. The superior belly of the omohyoid attaches to the hyoid bone and separates the carotid and muscular triangles. These sub-triangles are summarized in Table 2.

Summary of sub-triangles in the anterior neck CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 8 \\nCONTENTS OF THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE MUSCLES AND THEIR INNERVATION Beneath the skin, the superficial layer of fascia contains the extremely thin platysma muscle that tightens the skin of the neck when contracted (Figure 6, upper right). The platysma is innervated by CN VII like the other muscles of facial expression (covered in the Mind, Brain, and Behavior block). As mentioned above, the SCM separates the anterior and posterior triangles (Figures 2 & 6). Like the other muscles in the region, its name reflects its attachments-sternum and clavicle inferiorly (\"sternocleido-\") and mastoid process superiorly (\"mastoid\"). It is innervated by CN XI.Figure 6. Muscles in the anterior triangle. Anterior triangle outlined as solid blue with sub-triangles as dashed lines in bottom right image. The remaining muscles in the anterior triangle attach to the hyoid bone (with the exception of the sternothyroid) and play a role in speech and swallowing. Those that attach superiorly are classified as suprahyoid muscles that will broadly elevate the hyoid bone and larynx (along with specific functions related to their individual attachments; Figure 6). The suprahyoid muscles have varied innervations related to their embryonic origin. These are identified in Table 3 (as always, material in brackets is material that you are not responsible for at this time). CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 9 \\n The muscles that attach to the hyoid inferiorly are classified as infrahyoid muscles that will broadly depress the hyoid bone and larynx (Figure 6 & 7). As a rule, the infrahyoid muscles are innervated by the ansa cervicalis (ansa = handle in Latin), which is formed by a superior and an inferior limb (Figure 7). The superior limb arises from C1 fibers that travel with CN XII before branching off. The inferior limb has contributions from C2 and C3. These limbs usually meet within the carotid sheath anterior to the IJV.The only infrahyoid muscle not innervated by the ansa cervicalis is the thyrohyoid, which is innervated by C1 fibers that travel with CN XII and branch off distal to the superior limb of the ansa cervicalis.

Its three primary contents are the common carotid artery, internal jugular vein (IJV), and the vagus nerve (CNX) (review Figure 1). It also contains the deep cervical lymph nodes that travel with the vasculature in this region. At its superior origin near the jugular foramen, the carotid sheath will also house CNs IX, XI, and XII for a brief length. NERVES IN THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE The cranial nerves in the anterior triangle (Figure 8) are listed in Table 4 with their branches and targets. Figure 8.

CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 11 \\nThe sympathetic trunk extends into the neck from the superior mediastinum. It ascends slightly medial to the carotid sheath in the vertebral space deep to the prevertebral fascia (Figure 8). The notably large superior cervical ganglion near the base of the skull is the superior-most extent of the sympathetic trunk. From there, postganglionic sympathetics continue to targets in the head and neck along arterial plexuses (discussed in MBB block) or back down to the thorax in cardiopulmonary splanchnic nerves (see Posterior Mediastinum syllabus). ARTERIES IN THE ANTERIOR TRIANGLE The common carotid artery branches off the brachiocephalic artery on the right or directly off the arch of the aorta on the left. It ascends in the carotid sheath medial to the IJV before bifurcating into the external and internal carotid arteries at approximately the C4 vertebral level (recall that the hyoid bone sits at C3; Figure 9). The internal carotid artery (ICA) is the more posterior branch that mainly supplies intracranial structures including 2/3 of the brain. It has no branches in the neck. The carotid sinus is a dilation of the ICA just distal to the bifurcation. It contains baroreceptors to detect changes in blood pressure. The carotid body is a structure in the wall of the bifurcation that contains chemoreceptors to signal the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide (as well as pH) in the blood. The afferents in the carotid sinus nerve (of Hering) that transmit signals from both the carotid sinus and the carotid body travel primarily in CN IX, the glossopharyngeal nerve. Figure 9. Carotid bifurcation Clinical correlate: The carotid sinus of the internal carotid artery is a common site of atherosclerosis (plaque buildup), restricting the flow of blood to the brain. Treatment may involve carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the plaque) or angioplasty and stenting. The external carotid artery (ECA) is the more anterior branch of the common carotid artery that mainly supplies the extracranial structures of the head and neck (Figure 10). It has multiple branches in the neck. At the level of the bifurcation, the ascending pharyngeal artery typically branches from the deep surface of the ECA, making it difficult to locate (Figure 10). As the ECA continues superiorly, three additional arteries can be found emerging from its anterior surface, in ascending order: superior thyroid, lingual, and facial (Figure 10). The superior thyroid artery branches off and extends inferiorly to supply the thyroid gland. Along the way, the superior laryngeal CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Triangles of the Neck 12 \\nartery will branch off the superior thyroid artery and pair with the internal laryngeal nerve bound for the larynx. The lingual artery runs deep to the hyoglossus muscle to supply the tongue (the hypoglossal nerve runs superficial to the hyoglossus muscle). The facial artery is extremely tortuous as it runs through the submandibular triangle (sometimes within the submandibular gland) and over the inferior border of the mandible. It is not uncommon for the lingual and facial arteries to branch off the ECA as a common trunk. Figure 10. Common carotid artery and branches. Two additional arteries branch off the posterior side of the ECA, in ascending order: occipital and posterior auricular (Figure 10). The occipital artery travels towards the back of the head, twisting with the hypoglossal nerve as it does so. The posterior auricular is relatively small and branches off superiorly, making it difficult to locate from the neck. The ECA ends as it bifurcates into two terminal branches: superficial temporal and maxillary (Figure 10). The superficial temporal artery serves much of the scalp while the maxillary artery extends into the deep face, specifically the infratemporal fossa. We will cover both of these terminal branches in greater detail in E&H.All of the branches of the ECA are summarized in Table 5.

From there, the IJV descends in the carotid sheath lateral to the common carotid artery (Figure 8). Along the way, the veins of the head and neck travel back with the arteries of the same name to drain into the IJV.As stated in the posterior triangle section above, the IJV joins the subclavian vein at the venous angle to form the brachiocephalic vein (review Figure 4). LYMPHATICS OF THE NECK The superficial lymph nodes of the head and neck can often be felt when there is an infection or metastasis, making their palpation an important part of a physical exam (Figure 11). The clusters of superficial cervical nodes are named according to their location (no need to memorize) and drain inferiorly towards the deep cervical lymph nodes along the IJV.There are two common and prominent deep cervical nodes that you do need to be aware of. The jugulo-digastric node is located where the IJV crosses the digastric muscle. The jugulo-omohyoid node is located where the IJV crosses the omohyoid. The deep cervical nodes drain along the jugular lymphatic trunks, the main lymphatic vessels in the neck. The jugular lymphatic trunks will either join the thoracic or right lymphatic ducts or drain directly into the venous angles. The jugular lymphatic trunks are major pathways for cancer metastasis from the head and neck. Figure 11. Lymphatic drainage of the neck. It is important to understand the overall pattern of drainage on the right and the two specific nodes labeled from the left. You do not need to worry about the jugulofacial angle.

Fick equation: Cardiac Output = VO2\\xa0(oxygen consumption rate) / (arterial O2\\xa0content - venous O2\\xa0content). Vascular control refers to the body\\'s ability to selectively change blood flow to organs and tissues according to their metabolic needs as they change from moment to moment. In this chapter, we examine how the cardiovascular system continuously adjusts blood local control mechanisms and homeostatic reflexes. By the end of this chapter you should be able to: through a combination of flow Explain the Fluid Flow Equation and how it\\'s components of flow, pressure, and resistance apply to the cardiovascular system. Describe vascular tone and the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that influence it. Explain the homeostatic reflex control of blood pressure in terms of the baroreceptor reflex and its response to increases and decreases in arterial blood pressure. Because this is not an anatomic arrangement, note that the heart appears in three places: the right heart which pumps blood to the pulmonary circulation, the left heart which pumps blood to the systemic circulation, and the heart muscle tissue (via the coronary artery). The pulmonary and systemic circulations are arranged in series and therefore pump the same volume of blood per minute (cardiac output). The systemic organs are arranged in parallel, thus allowing independent control of flow to each organ. Some of these organs are blood-conditioning in that they recondition the composition of blood. For example, the kidneys adjust the electrolyte composition of the blood flowing through them, and the liver degrades toxins (among other functions). Blood-conditioning organs serve the entire internal environment, and thus receive much more blood than they metabolically need. This is why they can also temporarily withstand severe reductions in blood flow to allow flow to another organ with higher needs. The Poiseuille equation, is used to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system. It was derived from an equation calculating linear momentum in cylindrical coordinates. The result is: Q = ΔP 𝜋r4 8𝜂L where Q is flow, ΔP is the pressure difference between two points (ie the pressure gradient), r is the vessel radius, η is viscosity, and L is the vessel length. This is the Poiseuille equation and can be simplified to the Fluid Flow Equation: where Q = ΔPxR with R = 8𝜂L/𝜋r4. This equation can be applied to a single blood vessel, or to a complex network of vessels, such as the circulatory system. From this equation, we can infer that there are two ways that blood flow to an organ can be changed: 1. By altering the pressure difference across the vascular bed, or 2. By altering vascular resistance. In the next sections, we will apply the concepts of flow, pressure, and resistance to the circulatory system and thus begin to understand how the circulatory system manipulates blood flow to different organs. As an aside, it is useful to note that Q = ΔP/R is often compared to Ohm\\'s law, V = IR, where the current (I) is analogous to flow, R  is resistance, and voltage (V) is analogous to the pressure gradient driving that flow. The circulatory system forms a closed circuit. Thus, the system\\'s total flow is equal to the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per unit time. This flow is called the cardiac output (L/min) and is determined by: CO = SV x HR, where CO is cardiac output, SV is the volume of blood ejected from the heart per beat (the stroke volume) and HR is the number of heart beats per minute. In a person at rest, cardiac output is approximately 5 to 6 L/min (80 gallons/hour). Stroke volume depends on two factors: (1) ventricular contractility, and (2) venous return. Ventricular contractility is the strength of ventricular contraction. This will be discussed further in Chapter 5. Venous return is the volume of blood returned to the right heart from the systemic circulation. Venous vessels have very thin walls in proportion to their diameter, giving them the property of being quite distensible. This distensibility allows the venous circulation to act as a \"reservoir\" for blood. In fact, peripheral venules and veins typically contain over 50% of the total blood volume. There are three factors that influence the movement of venous blood to the heart: (1) Skeletal muscle pump. Veins have one-way valves that prevent reverse flow. When you stand upright, these vessels fill and distend as gravity causes blood to pool in the lower extremities. With movement, the contractions of the leg and abdominal muscles compress the veins, pushing blood forward to the right heart with the one-way valves preventing backward movement. Note that the skeletal muscle pump does not assist venous return when standing or sitting still. (2) Inspiration. When the diaphragm moves toward the abdomen during intrathoracic pressure inspiration, decreases. A decrease its compression on the inferior vena cava as it passes through the thorax. The vena cava subsequently thereby decreasing resistance and increasing flow to the right heart. Movement of the diaphragm into the abdomen during inspiration also compresses abdominal contents, enhancing venous return by squeezing the abdominal veins, which also pushes blood toward the right heart. to (3) Sympathetic vasoconstriction of the venous system. This constriction pushes blood forward to the right heart, thus increasing venous return. intrathoracic pressure will decrease thoracic cavity enlarges, and Innervation. Sympathetic increases in diameter, the in stimulation leads Heart rate is increased by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and decreased by stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. This will be discussed in more detail in the baroreceptor reflex section of this chapter and in Chapter 2. PREssURE (P) Blood flow is driven by the difference in pressure between two points, with blood moving toward the point of lower pressure. For example, blood flow in the systemic circulation is driven by the difference between the pressure in the aorta 4  1 \\n(~80-120 mm Hg), where blood exits the heart, and the pressure in the vena cava (~0-5 mm Hg), where blood returns to the heart. Blood flow through the pulmonary circulation is driven by the difference between the pressure in the pulmonary artery, where blood enters the pulmonary circulation, and the pressure in the left atrium, where blood exits the pulmonary circulation. How is pressure generated in the systemic circulation? With each heartbeat, ventricular contraction (systole) ejects a bolus of blood into the arterial side of the systemic circulation. One might then expect that pressure falls to zero during ventricular relaxation (diastole), however, this is not the case. Blood pressure is maintained during diastole by the elasticity of the arterial walls. During systole, the arteries dilate as blood is pumped into them (Figure 1-3A). During diastole, the artery acts as a pressure reservoir. As its stretched elastic wall recoils, this generates a force that maintains pressure (Figure 1-3B). This phenomenon is known as the Windkessel Effect (German: \\'wind bag\\'). Figure 1-3: The Windkessel Effect Arterial Pressure Because blood pressure is continuously changing through time, there are four measurements used to describe arterial blood pressure through the cardiac cycle (Figure 1-5). The first two are the systolic pressure (the peak pressure during systole) and the diastolic pressure (the pressure nadir during diastole). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is used to represent the average effective pressure that drives blood through the systemic organs and can be estimated as:  1 5 \\nMAP = Pdiastolic + 1 3 (Psystolic - Pdiastolic) = 2 3 Pdiastoli__ + 1 3 Psystolic. Notice in this equation how diastolic pressure is weighted more than systolic pressure. This is because diastole is approximately twice as long as systole. Pulse pressure is defined as: Ppulse = (Psystolic - Pd__astolic). Recall from above that diastolic pressure is determined by the elastic recoil of the arterial wall onto the volume of blood in the artery. If the arterial wall stiffens, it would lose this recoil and subsequently not be able to generate as much diastolic pressure (Pdiastolic). Thus, decreased elasticity results in a large, or \"wide\" pulse pressure (Ppulse). This is why pulse pressure tends to increase with age; mechanical stress over time, along with atherosclerosis, stiffens the arterial wall. Figure 1-4: Arterial Blood Pressure. The figure on the left indicates the systole and diastole portions of the cardiac cycle. The figure on the right illustrates pressure measurements. To calculate the pressure difference that drives systemic circulation, MAP is used to estimate the pressure in the aorta. The pressure in the vena cava is nearly zero. Thus, ΔP = Paorta - Pvena cava = MAP - 0 = MAP. Hence, in terms of the Fluid Flow Equation (Q = ΔP/R): Ca__diac Output = Mean Arterial Pressure Systemic Vascular Resistance . 6  1 \\nMeasuring Blood Pressure Blood pressure can be measured non-invasively by occluding an artery (typically the brachial artery) with an inflatable cuff. A manometer is attached to monitor the pressure within the cuff. When the pressure in the cuff is higher than the peak systolic blood pressure (Psystolic) inside the artery, the artery is fully collapsed and there is no flow. After initial inflation, the cuff is allowed to gradually deflate so the pressure within it falls slowly through the range of arterial pressure fluctuations. When the pressure from the cuff first falls below the systolic pressure, blood is able to pass through the partially occluded artery, but it does so intermittently. Because blood is passing through a narrow opening, its flow is turbulent, thereby generating sounds that can be auscultated with a stethoscope over the brachial artery. These sounds are known as Korotkoff sounds (Figure 1-5). The intermittent periods of flow continue until the cuff pressure falls below the diastolic pressure. At this point, the artery is completely open, blood moves freely through, and Korotkoff sounds disappear. Figure 1-5: Measurement of blood pressure by Korotkoff sounds. Point A is the systolic pressure and Point B is the diastolic pressure. Systemic Circulation Pressure Blood pressure is highest in the arteries and decreases as it flows through the circulatory system, with the pulses of pressure disappearing by the level of the capillaries (Figure 1-6). Pressure decreases because energy is dissipated as flow encounters resistance. The steepest drop occurs in the arterioles. Compared to arteries, arterioles have  1 7 \\nthicker walls and more smooth muscle. This smooth muscle allows arterioles to actively increase (vasodilate) or decrease (vasoconstrict) their radius in order to regulate blood flow to individual organs. This ability to dilate and constrict so effectively is why arterioles often referred to as resistance vessels. Note that it is the pressure difference (ΔP) between the aorta (MAP) and an arteriole (Parteriole) that drives flow to the organ that the arteriole feeds. Capillaries are the narrowest vessels in the vasculature. In fact, red blood cells larger than 7 um in diameter must deform to pass through them. Despite the large individual resistance, the number of capillaries is so numerous, that the collective cross-sectional area is more than 1000 times that of the aortic root. This large area, and their parallel arrangement, contributes to the capillary bed actually having less resistance than the arteriolar bed. Figure 1-6: Pressure drop across the systemic circulation. Notice how high resistance vessels (arterioles) lead to a large drop in pressure while low resistance vessels (the capillary bed in total) result in a smaller drop in pressure. RESISTANCE (R) At the beginning of this chapter, we estimated that resistance can be calculated as: R  = 8𝜂L 𝜋r4. From this equation, it becomes clear that the radius of a vessel is a very powerful determinant of resistance. Given that Q = ΔP R/ , small changes in radius will have large effects on flow. The pressure gradient is also affected by vessel 8  1 \\nradius. Thus, our discussion of vascular control will focus on the mechanisms that control vessel radius. Because length and viscosity are not actively controlled by the body to alter the distribution of blood flow, these variables will not be the focus of our discussion. Translating resistance to the systemic circulatory system, our basic flow equation becomes: Cardiac Output = MAP SVR where SVR is systemic vascular resistance. Resistance at any point in the circulatory system is influenced by three factors: 1. Vessel arrangement 2. The Third Pressure Phenomenon 3. Vascular tone Vessel Arrangement: In a circulatory system, vessels with individual resistances can be connected in series or in parallel. The arrangement of vessels determines how the total resistance, and subsequently flow, is calculated. An example of a series of resistors (Figure 1-7) is the circulation within an organ, where there is only one path for flow. Specifically, an organ is supplied by a major artery and is drained by a major vein. Within the organ are arterioles, capillaries, and venules. The total resistance is the sum of the resistance through each group of vessels. The systemic circulation is an example of parallel resistors (Figure 1-8). Since a parallel arrangement offers more paths for flow, it effectively reduces the total resistance of the system. Recall that each organ receives a percentage of systemic blood flow (cardiac output). This percentage generally favors the path of least resistance. Thus, since all organs share the same aortic pressure (estimated by MAP), an organ\\'s arteriolar radius determines the amount of blood flow to that organ. For example, vasodilation of the renal arterioles will increase flow to the kidney, while vasoconstriction of the cerebral arterioles will decrease flow to the brain. ROrgan Circulation = RArtery + RArteriole + RCapillary + RVenule + RVein Figure 1-7: Calculation of resistance for vessels in series in an organ.  1 9 \\n1 Rcirculation = 1 Rcerebral + 1 Rcoronary + 1 RGI + 1 Rskeletal muscle + __ Rskin + 1 Rrenal Figure 1-8: Calculation of resistance for vessels in parallel in the systemic circulation flow through the vasculature, is known as The Third Pressure Phenomenon As we learned when using a cuff to measure blood pressure, the pressure exerted on a collapsible vessel by its surrounding tissue can affect the flow of blood through it. This concept, when the surrounding tissue pressure influences blood the Third Pressure Phenomenon. Specifically, an increase in extravascular pressure can decrease a vessel\\'s diameter, simply by compression. An example of extravascular pressure is the skeletal muscle pumps that compress veins, thereby increasing venous return to the heart. Vascular Tone vasodilation and Vascular vasoconstriction. The mechanism of this was covered in MCBD and is described in the Appendix of this chapter for your reference. For the purposes this discussion, it is enough to know that an increase in Ca2+ initiates a series of events that cause smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction). An increase in cAMP (or cGMP) initiates a series of events that cause smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation). Blood flow to each organ is individually regulated by arteriolar vascular tone. At baseline, arterioles remain in a state of partial vasoconstriction, known as basal tone. Vascular tone reflects the level of activation of smooth muscle cells in that smooth muscle resistance by controls 10  1 \\nregion. Because there is a state of basal tone, the vasculature responds with either more constriction (vasoconstriction) or less constriction (vasodilation). At any given time, vascular tone is determined by the balance between competing vasoconstricting and vasodilating factors. These factors fall into two categories: extrinsic factors and intrinsic factors. EXTRINSIC AND INTRINSIC FACTORS Extrinsic Factors Extrinsic factors originate from outside of the organ or tissue in which the blood vessel is located. As such, they are either hormonal (circulating hormones) or neural. Their primary function is to regulate arterial blood pressure by altering systemic vascular resistance. Hormonal factors that cause vasodilation include: 1. Epinephrine (at low to moderate levels) released by the adrenal gland 2. Atrial natriuretic peptide: released from the atria. Hormonal factors that cause vasoconstriction include: 1. Angiotensin II generated by renin-angiotensin system 2. Vasopressin released from the posterior pituitary gland 3. Epinephrine (at high levels) released by the adrenal gland. Neural factors include: 1. Sympathetic innervation of vascular smooth muscle which leads to is released by sympathetic nerve vasoconstriction. Norepinephrine endings and binds to vascular smooth muscle alpha1-adrenergic receptors (G-protein coupled receptors). This binding activates a G-protein coupled enzyme cascade that increases intracellular Ca2+ which, in turn, triggers a cascade of events that cause vasoconstriction (see Appendix for detail). Note that the innervation of smooth muscle, and the corresponding adrenergic receptors expressed, are not the same for all organs. For example, bronchiolar smooth muscle expresses beta2-adrenergic receptors that bind norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves and cause bronchiolar dilation (think fight-or- flight and the need to facilitate breathing). Moreover, the adrenergic receptors expressed on vascular smooth muscle differs depending on the organ being supplied. Activation of each are used to divert blood flow toward more metabolically active organs via arteriole vasodilation (beta2 stimulation), and away from less metabolically active organs via by arteriole vasoconstriction (alpha1 stimulation).  1 11 \\n ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR VASCULAR RESPONSE alpha1 beta2 Vasoconstriction Vasodilation Table 1-1: Vascular smooth muscle response to adrenergic stimulation Vascular smooth muscle that are not innervated are referred to as unitary smooth muscle. There are two caveats about the effect of circulating epinephrine on unitary vascular smooth muscle that are important to note: 1. The first is that while circulating epinephrine can bind to beta2-adrenergic receptors to cause vasodilation, it can also bind to alpha1-adrenergic receptors to cause vasoconstriction. The predominating effect depends on the concentration of circulating epinephrine. This is illustrated in Figure 1-9 where ΔSVR ranges from low \"-\" resistance (vasodilation) to high \"+\" resistance (vasoconstriction). Note: this caveat does not apply to norepinephrine because it is released from sympathetic endings directly to its target rather than through the circulation. Figure 1-9: Change in SVR with circulating epinephrine concentration 2. The second caveat is that not all non-innervated vascular smooth muscle express beta-adrenergic receptors. beta-adrenergic receptors are expressed in non-innervated vascular smooth muscle in heart, liver, and skeletal muscle arterioles but not, for example, in arteriolar smooth muscle controlling blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract. One way to remember which tissues\\' arterioles have beta2 receptors is to recall the fight-or-flight response which leads to a generalized increase in sympathetic activity, along with the release of circulating epinephrine. Nonessential organs, such as the digestive tract, respond with vasoconstriction in order to divert blood 12  1 \\nflow to essential organs. These tissues have alpha1-adrenergic receptors that bind norepinephrine to vasoconstrict. Tissues that require enhanced blood flow have beta2-receptors that bind epinephrine and subsequently vasodilate to allow greater blood flow. Intrinsic Factors Intrinsic factors originate from the vessel itself or the surrounding tissue. Their primary function is to regulate local blood flow within an organ or tissue. Intrinsic factors include: Myogenic autoregulation 1. Myogenic autoregulation 2. Metabolic autoregulation (active and reactive hyperemia) 3. Endothelium-derived factors (nitric oxide and endothelin). Myogenic autoregulation is the intrinsic property of vascular smooth muscle to change its tone in response to changes in arterial pressure. Recall from the Fluid Flow Equation (Q = ΔP R/ ), that if ΔP changes, R  must also change in the same direction in order to keep Q constant. Within the autoregulatory range, myogenic autoregulation maintains steady flow by an active decrease in arteriole resistance (vasodilation) as arterial pressure drops (Figure 1-10). Similarly, there is an active increase in arteriole resistance (vasoconstriction) as arterial pressure rises. For example, if pressure in the renal artery drops, the renal arterioles will sense a change in transmural pressure and attempt to preserve steady renal blood flow by vasodilation. In other words, as arterial pressure changes within the autoregulatory range, arterioles change their resistance in order to maintain constant flow to the organ they supply. Outside the autoregulatory range, an arteriole has reached the limit of its ability to change its resistance and can no longer compensate for changes in arterial pressure. Here, resistance is constant, and flow directly increases or decreases with pressure (Figure 1-10 and 1-11). The mechanism of myogenic autoregulation is not clearly defined but is hypothesized to likely involve the stretch-sensitive ion channels in the arteriolar vascular smooth muscle cells.  1 13 \\nFigure 1-10: Myogenic autoregulation of Pressure versus Flow Figure 1-11: Myogenic autoregulation of Pressure versus Resistance 14  1 \\nMetabolic autoregulation The change in blood flow in response to local metabolic rate is called hyperemia. There are two kinds of hyperemia: active and reactive (Figure 1-12). Figure 1-12: A comparison of active hyperemia and reactive hyperemia. Active hyperemia is an increase in blood flow caused by a change in metabolic activity of the organ or tissues that the vessels supply. For example, blood flow increases to the skeletal muscle during exercise and returns to baseline levels shortly after exercise stops. The magnitude of increased flow is related to the vasodilatory capacity of the tissue. For example, blood flow to skeletal muscle may increase by as much 10 to 20-fold with increased activity, while cerebral blood flow may only increase 2-fold with increased neuronal activity. The mechanism of active hyperemia is thought to be initiated by a combination of hypoxia (oxygen is needed to generate ATP, which is needed for muscle contraction) and the generation of vasodilatory factors such as carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and lactic acid. Reactive hyperemia is hyperemia that occurs following a brief period of flow restriction, also referred to as post-occlusion hyperemia. During this period of flow restriction, myogenic autoregulation occurs, as well as the synthesis and release of vasodilatory metabolites by ischemic tissue. These metabolites build up in the vessels beyond the occlusion that are deprived of blood flow. When the occlusion is eliminated (ie release of a tourniquet), blood now flows into already vasodilated vessels. This decreased resistance results in a larger flow than baseline. As flow is restored, the accumulated vasodilators are washed away and smooth muscle tone returns to normal along with baseline blood flow. Endothelium derived factors The last intrinsic factor we will discuss are endothelium derived factors. Vessels have an epithelial cell lining, called the vascular endothelium, that is in direct contact with blood. The vascular endothelium has several functions: blood  1 15 \\nclotting, inflammation, angiogenesis, and the synthesis and release of factors that either vasodilate or vasoconstrict neighboring smooth muscle cells. The most common factors are nitric oxide (a vasodilator) and endothelin (a vasoconstrictor). Nitric oxide and endothelin are released depending on the activation of stretch-sensitive Ca2+ channels by shear stress on the endothelium. Shear stress is the pressure along the endothelial wall caused by blood flowing by. Increased sheer stress will increase nitric oxide synthesis and decrease endothelin synthesis, resulting in vasodilation. Decreased sheer stress will decrease nitric oxide synthesis and increase endothelin synthesis, causing vasoconstriction. Nitric oxide (NO) was originally known as Endothelium Derived Relaxing Factor (EDRF). It is a membrane permeant gas that diffuses out of the endothelial cell into surrounding arteriolar smooth muscle cells where it initiates a series of events that turn off smooth muscle contraction resulting in vasodilation. The nitric oxide signal transduction pathway was covered in MCBD and is described for reference in the Appendix. Note that in MCBD, you learned another mechanism of nitric oxide synthesis for smooth muscle relaxation via autonomic nervous system innervation of erectile tissue. In this case action potentials at the axon terminals open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. The resulting influx of Ca2+ triggers the synthesis of NO, which diffuses out of the nerve terminals and into the corresponding innervated smooth muscle. This leads to relaxation and increased blood flow to the erectile tissue. This sequence of events is different in that it does not involve nitric oxide production by endothelial cells. Yet in both cases, the resulting NO causes relaxation of the surrounding smooth muscle tissue using the same mechanism. Endothelin is a peptide that is packaged into vesicles and released by exocytosis onto endothelin receptors (G-protein coupled receptors) on the surface membrane of arteriolar smooth muscle cells. This subsequently activates an enzyme cascade that increases intracellular Ca2+, resulting in smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction). HOMEOSTATIC REFLEX CONTROL OF BLOOD PREssURE Homeostasis is the property of a system in which variables are regulated so that internal conditions, such as temperature, blood pH, and respiratory rate, are maintained within a normal range. In this section, we discuss the homeostatic reflex control of blood pressure: the baroreceptor reflex. The Baroreceptor Reflex Baroreceptors monitor blood pressure via stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors. They are found in abundance in the walls of the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch (Figure 1-13). 16  1 \\nFigure 1-13: Baroreceptors of the Carotid Sinus and Aortic Arch. Blue indicates sympathetic neurons and green indicates parasympathetic neurons. thus increasing to Baroreceptors consist of highly branched unmyelinated nerve endings that contain stretch-sensitive non-selective cation channels. These channels open when the tissue in which they are embedded are stretched. The resulting influx of cations depolarizes the nerve endings, thus exciting action potentials. In order to maintain steady blood flow to the brain and heart, baroreceptors use this mechanism to continuously monitor and respond to changes in arterial pressure. For example, when arterial pressure rises, the baroreceptors are stimulated, the brain\\'s cardiovascular control center (the medulla oblongata). The cardiovascular control center then sends negative feedback to the cardiovascular system in order to decrease arterial pressure back to baseline. This is accomplished by decreasing sympathetic activity to the heart and arterioles and increasing parasympathetic activity to the SA node. These changes lead to decreased contractility, vasodilation, and decreased heart rate respectively. This translates to decreased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance, both of which lead to decreased arterial pressure (Figure 1-14). Conversely, when arterial pressure drops, the baroreceptor reflex leads to an increase in sympathetic activity to the heart and arterioles and a decrease in parasympathetic activity to the SA node. These changes lead to increased transmission of signals their  1 17 \\nincreased heart rate respectively. This contractility, vasoconstriction, and translates to increased cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, both of which lead to increased arterial pressure (Figure 1-15). Figure 1-14: Baroreceptor response to increased arterial pressure. Figure 1-15: Baroreceptor response to decreased arterial pressure 18  1 \\nFinally, what happens when arterial pressure remains elevated for an extended period of time? We know that baroreceptors sense the absolute stretch of the arteries, increasing their firing rate with increasing mean arterial pressure (Figure 1-16). In addition to sensing absolute stretch, baroreceptors also sense the rate of change of stretch. For example, if the arterial pressure remains elevated for several days, the baroreceptor firing rate will gradually return toward normal. In this way, baroreceptors adapt to long-term changes in arterial pressure. Figure 1-16: Baroreceptor firing rate as a function of MAP. 1 19 \\nSUMMARY In this chapter, we applied elements of the Fluid Flow Equation (Q = ΔP R/ ) to the circulatory system to understand how the body selectively changes blood flow to organs and tissues according to their metabolic needs. Cardiac output (Q ) is determined by heart rate and stroke volume, the latter determined by cardiac contractility and venous return. Because right atrial pressure is nearly 0 mm Hg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) serves as an estimate of ΔP across the entire circulatory system. Blood pressure is closely and continuously monitored by baroreceptors in the carotid bodies and aortic arch, which attempt to maintain homeostasis through manipulation of heart rate, stroke volume, and vascular tone. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is the resistance (R) across the entire systemic circulatory system. There is also resistance at each component of the circulatory system. Vascular tone at the level of arterioles supplying each organ creates resistance that significantly influences the distribution of blood flow to each organ. This is accomplished by vasodilation or vasoconstriction according to that organ\\'s metabolic demands. In addition to extrinsic factors, vascular tone is also determined by the intrinsic factors of myogenic autoregulation, metabolic autoregulation (active and reactive hyperemia), and endothelium-derived factors (primarily nitric oxide and endothelin). Altogether, this complex system continuously regulates blood flow according to our body\\'s changing metabolic needs. 20  1 \\nAPPENDIX This Appendix is optional reading and included for reference only.

Ca2+ entry is increased by events that depolarize cell and decreased by events that hyperpolarize cell. When a ligand binds to the G-protein coupled receptor on the surface membrane, a G-protein coupled enzyme cascade is activated resulting in generation of IP3, which binds to IP3 receptors on SR to release Ca2+.

Adenosine binds to adenosine receptor cAMP activation of PKA inhibits smooth muscle contraction by phosphorylating: 1. K+ channels causing the channels to close, resulting in hyperpolarization (a more negative membrane potential) that closes voltage-gated calcium channels causing decrease Ca2= entry. Decrease in Ca2+ turns smooth muscle contraction off. 2. Phospholamban, a regulatory protein that when phosphorylates stimulate sarcoplasmic Ca2+ pump, which reduces Ca2+ in the cytoplasm and turns smooth muscle contraction off. 24  1 \\nAPPENDIX 5: Endothelium Derived Factors References: 1.

As you study, note the physiological and pharmacological principles underlying each system. This will allow you to see how the drugs on your drug list for this session represent the practical applications of those principles. As an aid for future reference (ie board review) this chapter includes drugs that are not on your drug list. You will only be tested on the drugs listed on the drug lists for this block and not on the additional drugs mentioned in this chapter or from the MCBD drug list. Parasympathetic activity slows the heart by hyperpolarization and slowing of the rate of diastolic depolarization in the sino- atrial node and reduces contractile force in the atria by shortening the atrial action potential. Parasympathetic stimulation also decreases conduction velocity in the AV node. There is very sparse parasympathetic innervation of the ventricles in humans, so parasympathetic stimulation causes either no or very small decreases in ventricular contractility Sympathetic activity increases heart rate by increasing the rate of diastolic depolarization and increases contractile force by increasing Ca2+ influx during the action potential and by regulating the activity of proteins involved in calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and in the contractile apparatus. Sympathetic stimulation also the generation of action potentials) in the AV node and His-Purkinje system. increases automaticity (i.e., accelerates Vascular Smooth Muscle Sympathetic activity mediates the main effects of the ANS on the vasculature. Sympathetic activity causes contraction of most of the vasculature. However, sympathetic activity can cause either contraction or dilation of the skeletal muscle vasculature. As will be discussed below, these different responses are mediated by different types of receptors: constriction is mediated by alpha1 adrenergic receptors and dilation is mediated by beta2 adrenergic receptors Parasympathetic activity plays little if any role in the direct regulation of vascular tone because of the lack of parasympathetic innervation of most of the vasculature. However, cerebral, coronary, and genital blood vessels do receive parasympathetic innervation which mediates vasodilation. Kidney Sympathetic stimulation acts on the juxtaglomerular cells to cause renin release. (A brief aside/reminder: renin converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II is a potent arteriole vasoconstrictor and also promotes release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone in turn acts on the kidney to promote the reabsorption of sodium and water.) The Autonomic Reflexes There are baroreceptors (stretch receptors) in the aortic arch and carotid sinus which detect changes in blood pressure and send axons to the brainstem to regulate the activity of the ANS: in response to an increase in blood pressure, sympathetic activity will decrease and parasympathetic activity will increase. Conversely, a decrease in blood pressure will evoke an increase in sympathetic outflow and a decrease in parasympathetic outflow. As we will see, the autonomic reflexes are powerful enough to cause drugs to produce effects opposite the pharmacological receptors at which those drugs can act. from what might be predicted based just on knowing 2 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 2 \\nAUTONOMIC RECEPTORS IN THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM Muscarinic receptors While there are five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) encoded by different genes, there are only three mAChR subtypes which have significant effects in the CVS.The M2 receptor is the only mAChR that is expressed at significant levels in the heart, where it mediates both the negative chronotropic and negative inotropic effects of parasympathetic stimulation. Even though most blood vessels do not have cholinergic innervation, essentially all blood vessels have M3 receptors. Activation by pharmacological administration of muscarinic agonists of M3 receptors expressed on the endothelial cells in the blood vessels causes vasodilation due to the release of NO and other vasodilatory substances. The cerebral blood vessels differ from other vessels: the predominant mAChR which mediates vasodilation of the cerebral blood vessels is the M5 receptor. While subtype-selective M3 agonists and antagonists are used therapeutically for their actions in the salivary glands and airways, respectively, there are no subtype selective muscarinic drugs used therapeutically for their actions in the CVS.Adrenergic receptors See Table 2-2 for an overview of the distribution and response of adrenergic receptors in the cardiovascular system. Alpha (alpha) receptors It is usually said that the alpha1 receptors mediate contraction of vascular smooth muscle and the alpha2 receptors are the presynaptic receptors that inhibit norepinephrine release from noradrenergic nerve terminals. The two main major classes of alpha-adrenergic receptors (alpha1 and alpha2 receptors) each consists of three subtypes. Alpha1A and alpha1D receptors are enriched in the bladder and prostate. Alpha1A and alpha1B are in vascular smooth muscle, although the alpha1B receptor predominates in aging. All three alpha2 receptors, alpha2A, 2B, and 2C, contribute to the inhibition of release of norepinephrine from sympathetic terminals. The actual situation is a bit more complicated than the generalizations described in the previous paragraph. There are also low levels of alpha1A and alpha1B receptors in the ventricles, where they probably contribute to the positive inotropic responses both of norepinephrine and of certain drugs. There are also alpha2B receptors in some blood vessels which can contribute to vasoconstriction in response to some adrenergic agonists. Beta (beta) Receptors There are three subtypes of beta-adrenergic receptors. The beta1 receptors are the main subtype of beta receptor in the heart and are also on the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney, where they promote renin release; there are also beta1 receptors on some fat cells. beta2 receptors mediate relaxation of smooth muscles and dilation of the skeletal muscle vasculature; there are also some beta2 receptors in the heart. The beta3 receptors are present on fat cells and mediate relaxation of the bladder; while low levels of beta3 receptors have been detected in the heart, they do not appear to have a significant role in the CVS.Dopamine receptors You will learn in Mind, Brain and Behavior about the many subtypes of dopamine receptors and their diverse actions in the central nervous system. There are D1 dopamine receptors that cause vasodilation of the renal, mesenteric, and coronary vascular beds. Atropine is used to relieve bradycardia caused by excessive vagal tone and is used with dobutamine for pharmacologically-induced stress testing. The cardiovascular effects of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors can be complex, because ACh levels can be increased at both ganglionic (nicotinic) and muscarinic receptors. Pyridostigmine can be used to increase blood pressure in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, because inhibition of AChE increases nAChR-mediated transmission in the sympathetic ganglia. While not as effective as alpha1-agonist mediated increases in blood pressure (see below), pyridostigmine does not cause supine hypertension. 4 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 2 \\nCARDIOVASCULAR ACTIONS OF THE CATECHOLAMINES Epinephrine Epinephrine is more potent at beta2 receptors than at alpha1 receptors. As a consequence, the effects of administration of epinephrine on blood pressure are dose-dependent. Low doses of epinephrine cause a decrease in total peripheral resistance, due to activation of beta2 receptors in skeletal muscle vasculature with little net change in mean blood pressure. (See Figure 1 and Figure 2.) Heart rate and cardiac output increase due to stimulation of cardiac beta receptors. Higher doses activate alpha1 receptors causing vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure; this is followed shortly thereafter by a secondary vasodepressor effect (why?). Therapeutic uses of epinephrine include stimulation of the heart in cardiac arrest, treatment of anaphylactic shock, and slowing of the absorption of local anesthetics (due to alpha1 mediated vasoconstriction). Norepinephrine Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter used by most postganglionic adrenergic fibers. Pharmacologically administered norepinephrine mainly acts on alpha receptors and the beta1 receptors; it has little effect on beta2 receptors. Thus, blood pressure and total peripheral resistance are raised due to alpha1 mediated vasoconstriction. Heart rate is decreased due to a baroceptor reflex-mediated increase in vagal tone. Norepinephrine is used to produce short-term vasoconstriction to preserve coronary and cerebral blood flow in hypotensive crises.  2 5 \\n Isoproterenol Isoproterenol is an agonist with a high degree of specificity for all three subtypes of beta receptors but is not active at alpha receptors. It relaxes skeletal muscle vascular beds, causing blood pressure and vascular resistance to fall. It has positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the heart, and heart rate and cardiac output increase. It has limited clinical utility in some cases of bradycardia. Dopamine Dopamine can activate vasodilatory dopamine (D1) receptors in mesenteric and renal vessels, can activate beta receptors with lower potency, and can activate alpha1 receptors with even lower potency. It causes a decrease in peripheral resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and can increase blood pressure and heart rate. Dopamine is used for short-term increases in cardiac output in heart failure and in shock. Droxidopa Droxidopa is a \"prodrug\"- it is converted in nerve terminals to norepinephrine. It is used to promote vasoconstriction in patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIONS OF NONCATECHOLAMINE ADRENERGIC AGONISTS Alpha-adrenergic Agonists Phenylephrine Phenylephrine stimulates alpha1 receptors but possess very little beta activity. It thus increases blood pressure and peripheral resistance, while heart rate usually falls due to a reflex increase in parasympathetic tone. Phenylephrine is used to produce short-term vasoconstriction to preserve coronary and cerebral blood flow in hypotensive crises, and to test the sensitivity of the autonomic reflexes (by measuring the extent of reflex bradycardia in response to a specified increase in blood pressure). Phenylephrine and other alpha agonists are also used as nasal decongestants: the vasoconstriction shrinks the nasal mucosa. Midodrine Midodrine is used as an alpha1 agonist. Midodrine itself is actually a \"prodrug\"- it is 6 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 2 \\nprobably occurs this rebound hypertension metabolically converted to the active form. It is used to increase blood pressure in patients with autonomic insufficiency and postural hypotension (for example, in patients with autonomic neuropathy or with cervical spinal cord injury). Clonidine Clonidine is a selective alpha2 agonist. It causes hypotension via the CNS-it acts at alpha2A receptors in the vasomotor center in the brainstem to decrease the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition to its use as an antihypertensive agent, clonidine is effective in reducing the withdrawal symptoms of addiction to alcohol, opiates, and nicotine. Abrupt cessation of clonidine can cause hypertension; because downregulation of the alpha2 receptors results in increased sympathetic outflow. Methyldopa Methyldopa (alpha-methyl-DOPA) terminals, converted to alpha-methyl-norepinephrine, and stored in vesicles. It can be released upon neuronal stimulation and thus acts as a \"false neurotransmitter.\" Alpha-methyl-norepinephrine can act (like clonidine) as an agonist at alpha2A receptors in the CNS to decrease sympathetic outflow, so that methyl dopa has hypotensive actions. While it is not recommended as an initial therapy for hypertension, it is one of several drugs recommended to treat hypertension during pregnancy. Both alpha-methyl-DOPA and clonidine can produce similar side effects: sedation, dry mouth, impotence, postural hypotension (less likely with clonidine) and hypertensive crisis if withdrawn too rapidly. (Students frequently ask why do these drugs cause dry mouth? The dry mouth, like sedation, is due to actions in the CNS.) into adrenergic is taken up Beta1-Adenergic Agonists: Dobutamine Dobutamine originally was believed to be a selective beta1 agonist with little alpha or beta2 activity. While still frequently referred to as a beta1 selective agonist, it is now known that dobutamine has more complex actions. Dobutamine is a racemic mixture whose enantiomers have different pharmacological specificities. The result is that dobutamine has some selectivity for beta1 over beta2 receptors and also acts as a selective agonist at alpha1 receptors. At relatively low doses, the racemic mixture increases inotropic activity of the heart with relatively little effect on chronotropic activity. (The reason for this is not clear. It may be due to the fact that in human heart, most of the receptors in the ventricles are beta1, while the atria, and presumably the S-A node, contain a significant fraction of beta2 receptors. There is also evidence that there are alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the heart that mediate a positive inotropic effect.) Total peripheral resistance is not significantly changed, perhaps due to a balance between alpha1-mediated vasoconstriction and beta2- mediated vasodilation. Dobutamine is used to increase cardiac output in conditions such as acute heart failure. Dobutamine is another example of a drug whose effects are dose-dependent. While low doses increase contractile force while having little effect on heart rate, higher doses will increase both the rate and force of cardiac contraction. Dobutamine (sometimes in combination with atropine) is therefore also used for cardiac stress testing in patients with pulmonary or orthopedic problems which  2 7 \\nprevent exercise-induced stress testing. Dopamine D1-Agonists Fenoldopam is a D1 agonist that causes rapid vasodilation of the renal and mesenteric vasculature after IV administration. It is used to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive emergencies. PHARMACOLOGICAL ANTAGONISTS ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR ACTIONS OF Non-selective Alpha Antagonists Phenoxybenzamine displays a high degree of specificity for the alpha receptor and forms an irreversible covalent complex, due to alkylation of the receptor. It is therefore long-acting and its effects last for at least a day. Phentolamine is a short acting, reversible antagonist. The pharmacological effects of phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine are those expected from alpha blockage: a decrease in peripheral resistance, reflex tachycardia, increase in cardiac output, etc. They have little effect on blood pressure in resting, recumbent individuals, but can decrease BP if standing (a phenomenon called postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension). Phenoxybenzamine is sometimes used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma. Phentolamine is used to counteract the local vasoconstriction that can occur due to extravasation of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Alpha1 Selective Antagonists Doxazosin, prazosin, and terazosin are reversible antagonists that are relatively specific for post-synaptic alpha1 receptors; terazosin and doxazosin have a much longer duration of action than prazosin. They are used to inhibit sympathetic vasoconstrictive tone while producing less tachycardia than non-selective alpha blockers. There is less tachycardia because the presynaptic alpha2 receptors are not blocked. These presynaptic receptors are therefore still active and able to inhibit the release of norepinephrine from the nerve terminals, so that the heart rate is lower than it would be if the presynaptic receptors were blocked. The alpha1- adrenergic antagonists will also relax smooth muscle in the prostate and increase urine flow in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Non-Selective Beta-Adrenergic Antagonists Propranolol was the first beta adrenergic antagonist to be used clinically and blocks both beta1 and beta2 receptors. Nadolol and timolol are among the other non-selective beta blockers that are also used clinically in the U.S.In resting subjects, the beta blockers decrease heart rate, cardiovascular output, and blood pressure (slightly). Under conditions of high sympathetic tone they cause large reductions in chronotropic and inotropic effects. They have many uses in the CVS, including treatment of angina, arrhythmias, and hypertension. The antihypertensive effects are due to a combination of decreased cardiac output, decreased renin release from the kidneys, and decreased sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system. 8 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 2 \\nThey can also block other beta-mediated effects such as beta adrenergic mediated bronchodilation, and thus can precipitate attacks in asthmatics. The beta blockers can produce a variety of adverse effects, including bronchoconstriction, heart failure, CNS effects such as nausea and depression, and can blunt recognition of hypoglycemia and delay recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Abrupt cessation of treatment with beta blockers can lead to angina, tachycardia, or hypertension. (Why does this happen? Chronic treatment with an antagonist can be considered to cause a pharmacological denervation of the target organ, leading to an up-regulation of beta receptors in the heart and increased sensitivity to endogenous agonists if administration of the antagonist is suddenly stopped.) Beta1-Specific Blockers Atenolol, esmolol, and metoprolol are examples of beta1 selective antagonists. They are used for their therapeutic effects in the CVS with fewer effects on other effector organs. (High doses can block both beta1 and beta2 receptors). Esmolol is used for emergency treatment of sinus tachycardia and atrial fibrillation; its short half- life allows rapid withdrawal if adverse effects (e.g., bradycardia or hypotension) occur. Combined Alpha-and Beta-Adrenergic Blockers Labetalol Labetalol acts as a selective antagonist at alpha1- adrenergic receptors and a non- selective antagonist at beta-adrenergic receptors; it has a higher affinity at betA-adrenergic receptors than at alpha adrenergic receptors, so that at relatively low doses, it produces mainly beta adrenergic blockade. Labetalol is used for the treatment of hypertension and pheochromocytoma-associated hypertension, and for the hypertension associated with abrupt clonidine withdrawal. Carvedilol Carvedilol also acts as a selective antagonist at alpha1- adrenergic receptors and a non-selective antagonist at beta-adrenergic receptors. It has a higher selectivity at beta-adrenergic receptors than does labetalol. It is used in congestive heart failure. Carvedilol acts as a \"biased agonist\": it does not mediate beta-adrenergic stimulation of adenylyl cyclase but allows GRK (G-protein coupled receptor kinase) to phosphorylate the beta1 receptor. This phosphorylation recruits beta-arrestin to the receptor, which then couples the receptor to signaling pathways that have cardioprotective actions.  2 9 \\n 10 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 2 \\nChapter 3 Microcirculation and Lymph Author: Peter Detwiler, PhD, Shobha Stack, PhD, MD INTRODUCTION The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells and remove carbon dioxide and metabolic end products. The exchange of fuel for waste takes place in the microcirculation across the 1 \\uf06dm thin walls of the capillaries, the smallest vessels in the vasculature (~5 \\uf06dm in diameter). Blood flows into the capillaries from the arterioles, and out of capillaries into the venules. In addition to these capillaries, the microcirculation also includes lymphatic capillaries and collecting ducts. In this chapter, we examine the properties of the microcirculation and the mechanism of capillary exchange. At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Compare and contrast the cardiovascular and lymphatic systems overall and at the capillary level. Compare and contrast the transcellular versus paracellular capillary exchange. Explain Starling\\'s Principle and its corresponding equation. Describe the four major causes of edema. ANATOMY Microvasculature The anatomy of the microvasculature in the cardiovascular system (excluding the lymphatic components) is illustrated in Figure 3-1. The vascular elements in the figure have been covered in our session on \"Histology of the Blood Vessels and Heart\" and briefly reviewed here. Note that metarterioles and precapillary sphincters are not universal components of the microcirculation in general, but unique features of the mesenteric microcirculation. Lymphatic System Fluids that leak out of the blood vessels (vascular system) are collected and returned to cardiovascular system by a network of lymphatic capillaries, vessels and nodes (Figure 3-2). As blood circulates through the body, nutrients, gases, and waste are exchanged between the blood and interstitial fluid. Pressure (hydrostatic and osmotic, discussed later in this chapter) drives fluid out of the capillary on the arteriole side and back into the capillary on the venule side. However, not everything returns to the venule side. Excess interstitial fluid that is not reabsorbed into the venules is instead collected by a network of lymphatic capillaries that drain into larger lymphatic vessels that return it to the bloodstream. These lymphatic capillaries have one-way valves that insure flow moves only toward the heart. Moreover, flow is promoted by the compression of lymphatic vessels by surrounding structures, such as muscle, and by the propulsive actions of smooth  3 1 \\nmuscle in the lymphatic walls. Interstitial fluid that enters the lymphatic vessels is called lymph. Figure 3-1: Anatomy of the Microvasculature Figure 3-2: The Lymphatic System 2  3 \\nLymphatic Capillaries. Lymphatic vessels, like the vessels of the cardiovascular system, are lined by endothelial cells, which also form the walls of lymphatic capillaries. Lymphatic capillaries are more freely permeable to substances than cardiovascular capillaries. This is due in large part to the endothelial cells in lymphatic capillaries not being tightly joined to each other as they are in cardiovascular capillaries. The edges of endothelial cells in lymphatic capillaries overlap each other loosely, forming easy-opening, flap-like minivalves. Collagen filaments anchor the endothelial cells to surrounding structures. When fluid pressure in the interstitial space is greater than the pressure in the lymphatic capillaries, the minivalves open, allowing fluid to enter the lymphatic capillary. However, when the pressure is greater inside the lymphatic capillary, it forces the endothelial minivalve flaps to close, preventing lymph from leaking back out into the interstitial space. Proteins (ie albumin) in the interstitial space are unable to enter blood capillaries due to their large size but they can enter lymphatic capillaries easily. Additionally, when inflamed, lymphatic capillaries develop openings that permit the uptake of even larger particles such as cell debris and bacteria. The particles then travel through lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes where pathogens are filtered. Cardiovascular Capillaries Capillaries have no smooth muscle or neural innervation and are lined with a single layer of flattened endothelial cells and basal lamina, a thin acellular layer of extracellular matrix. Cell junctions between the endothelial cells vary from tissue to tissue and determine the \"leakiness\" of the capillary. There are three types of capillaries: continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal. These were covered during our session on \"Histology of Blood Vessels and Heart\" and are reviewed here in Figure 3-3. The density of capillaries in a tissue depends on the metabolic activity of the cells. Tissues with a high metabolic rate needs more oxygen and nutrients and have more capillaries per unit area. Subcutaneous tissue and cartilage have the lowest capillary density, while muscles and glands have the highest. It is estimated that we have ~50,000 miles of capillaries, with a total surface area for exchange equivalent to 33 tennis courts. tissues become Figure 3-3: Cardiovascular Capillaries  3 3 \\nCAPILLARY EXCHANGE There are two conditions that must be met for materials to be exchanged between blood and interstitial fluid: (1) sufficient time for the exchange to take place and (2) the substances to be exchanged must be able to cross the capillary wall. Capillary blood velocity Flow (Q ) is the volume of fluid that passes by per unit time (ie L/min, or m3/sec). This is also equal to the velocity of fluid (m/sec) traveling through a cross- sectional area (m2). Q = = velocity x area volume time Notice in Figure 3-4 that the velocity of blood in the capillaries is much lower relative to other vessels. Yet, cardiac output is ~5 L/min. Because the cardiovascular system is a closed circuit, flow in all the parts of the vascular system (arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins) must be equal. This is possible, despite the slow velocity in the capillaries, because of the high total capillary cross-sectional area that makes up for the low velocity, thus maintaining consistent flow (Figure 3-5). Figure 3-4: Changes in cross sectional area and velocity as blood moves through the circulation 4  3 \\n Figure 3-5: Comparison of vascular structural characteristics. Capillary velocity is approximately 1-2 mm/s, which means that blood will take 0.5-2 s to traverse a capillary 1-2 mm in length. This is sufficient \"dwell\" time for red blood cells to exchange O2 and CO2 with tissue. Notably, with very high flow rates, such as during extreme exercise, it is possible that the capillary dwell time of red blood cells can become so abbreviated that there is inadequate time for equilibration between the blood and the tissue. Capillary Exchange Types In order for a substance to be exchanged between the blood and interstitial fluid, it must either pass through the endothelial cell that makes up the wall of the capillary (transcellular exchange) or go around it via gaps between adjacent endothelial cells or perforations in the endothelial cell itself (paracellular exchange). Transcellular Exchange For a substance to cross a single cell separating one compartment from another, it must cross the cell\\'s membrane twice: once to get into the cell from the first compartment and again to get out of the cell into the other compartment. There are two ways to do this: diffusion and transcytosis.  3 5 \\nDiffusion There are two important things to note about diffusion: 1. Substances diffuse down a concentration gradient and 2. The time it takes for a particle to diffuse increases with the square of the distance. For example, if the diffusion distance increases 10-fold, then the time it takes to diffuse that distance increases by 100-fold (102). Thus, while diffusion is a useful way to move things over short distances, it becomes more difficult over long distances. As another example, a small molecule in water at room temperature can diffuse 1 \\uf06dm in 0.5 millisecond, 10 \\uf06dm in 50 milliseconds, and 1 meter (roughly the distance from the big toe to the spinal cord) in 15.9 years. This illustrates why our lives depend on electrical signaling and why every cell in the body is less than (and usually much less than) 100 \\uf06dm from a capillary. For any substance to cross the capillary wall by diffusing through the endothelial cell lining, it must be membrane permeant. As discussed in MCBD, the lipid bilayer membrane excludes polar compounds, but allows nonpolar compounds through. Nonpolar compounds include lipid soluble molecules and, especially important for our discussion, O2 and CO2 which diffuse freely through cellular membranes. The membrane is not permeable to nutrients such as glucose and amino acids. These require specialized membrane proteins to transport them into one side of the endothelial cell and out the other side in order for them to be pass through the endothelial cell lining of the capillary. Transcytosis Transcytosis uses vesicles to capture macromolecules on one side of the cell by endocytosis, carry them across the interior of the cell and release them by exocytosis on the other side of the cell. Insulin (5.8 kDa) and albumin (60 kDa) are examples of macromolecules that are transported across endothelial cells by transcytosis. The steps in transcytosis are illustrated in Figure 3-6. Figure 3-6: Transcytosis 6  3 \\nform selective to intercellular barriers Paracellular Exchange Paracellular exchange is the passage of substances across the endothelial cell wall of the capillary via the intercellular spaces between or through the cells. The size of these spaces, which determines what they allow to go through them, vary depending on the type of capillary. Of the three types of endothelium (continuous, fenestrated, and sinusoidal), only continuous and fenestrated endothelium the passage of macromolecules between the circulation and the underlying interstitium. These two types of capillaries are capable of rapid and extensive bidirectional exchange of small molecules in the capillaries and postcapillary venules. These two parts of the vascular tree constitute what is often referred to as the microvascular exchange system. Paracellular Exchange in Types of Capillaries Paracellular exchange occurs fenestrated, and sinusoidal. Continuous Capillaries (the most common type of capillary) are joined to each other by tight junctions that are either: types of capillaries: continuous, in three Impenetrable tight junctions: form a seal that blocks any paracellular exchange. These are found in the blood brain barrier in the CNS and blood urine barrier in the bladder. Leaky tight junctions: form a size-selective pathway that excludes large but not small macromolecules with molecular weights less 500 Da (0.5 nm radius). This would enable, for example, both glucose (MW 180 Da) and amino acids (average MW 110 Da) to be exchanged by the paracellular pathway. Notably, the permeability of endothelial cell tight junctions can change depending on local conditions. The molecular basis for this has not been elucidated. In addition to difference in the permeability of their tight junctions, the endothelial cells in the wall of continuous capillaries can also be distinguished by the prevalence of the cellular machinery used for transcytosis. The endothelial lining of the continuous capillaries in muscle and adipose tissue are specialized for a high level of transcytosis. For example, the average number of transport vesicles in skeletal muscle endothelium is ~1200/\\uf06dm3, versus 130/mm3 in pulmonary capillaries. The reason for enriched transcytosis in muscle and adipose tissue is not known but might be related to the fact that these are two of the principal target organs for insulin whose cellular effects are dependent on its access to the tissue. Fenestrated Capillaries are made up of endothelial cells with membrane-lined water filled holes, called fenestrations (from Latin for windows), approximately 6- 15 nm in diameter. These fenestrations permit the exchange of water and solutes by allowing passage directly through them, completely bypassing the interior of the endothelial cell (Figure 3-7). This type of capillary is found in tissues with high trans-capillary flows such as secretory glands and the intestine.  3 7 \\nFigure 3-7: Fenestrated capillary fenestrations Sinusoidal (Discontinuous) Capillaries can be considered a special type of fenestrated capillary, but with (membrane-lined water-filled perforations) that lack a diaphragm and an underlying basal lamina and are larger in diameter (50-200 nm) than a perforation in fenestrated capillaries, thus allowing the exchange of larger proteins and even whole cells. Forces that Drive Paracellular Exchange Paracellular routes behave as size-selective filters (ie a semipermeable membrane). However, the net direction of fluid flow depends on the balance of hydrostatic and osmotic pressures (known as Starling forces) between the capillary and the interstitium. When net movement is out of the capillary, this is called filtration. When net movement is into the capillary, this is called absorption. Hydrostatic Pressure The hydrostatic pressure difference across the capillary wall is the difference in pressure inside the capillary (Pc) and the pressure in the interstitial fluid (Pi). Pc is determined by the arterial and venous pressures (since the capillary is between these two levels) but is closer to the arterial pressure. Other than the kidney, Pc decreases over the length of the capillary due to filtration of fluid. Hence, Pc is higher at the arterial end of the capillary than at the venule end of the capillary. Pi, the pressure opposing filtration, is near or below 0 mm Hg. Osmotic Pressure Given the typically favorable hydrostatic gradient for filtration, nearly our entire plasma volume would be in the interstitium if it weren\\'t for the counteracting osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure is created from the tendency of water to move from regions of low solute concentration, to regions of high solute concentration. The gradient that is created depends only on the solute concentration; it does not depend on the mass nor the identity of the solute. The concept of osmotic pressure is illustrated in Figure 3-8. Water flows down its concentration gradient from left side to the right side (3-8a. Initial state) until the 8  3 \\nconcentration is the same on either side of the partition (3-8b. Equilibrium). The osmotic pressure (\\uf050) of the solution is the hydrostatic pressure that would need to be applied to right side to counteract the osmotic flow of fluid in the initial state (3-8c. External pressure applied). The osmotic pressure of a solution measured in this way is an expression of the number of dissolved particles in the solution; the greater the number of dissolved particles in a solution the greater the solution\\'s osmotic pressure. Note that fluid flows up an osmotic gradient, and not down the gradient. This is opposite to the direction of flow in all other gradients we are used to thinking about (ie a pressure gradient moves fluid from an area of high pressure toward an area of lower pressure). In an osmotic gradient, fluid flows across a semipermeable partition from the solution with few dissolved particles (low osmotic pressure) to the side with a greater number of dissolved particles (high osmotic pressure). Note that osmotic pressure is primarily due to the presence of albumin and other large proteins in the plasma which are not typically in the interstitium. Thus, there is typically a large osmotic force favoring capillary absorption. Figure 3-8: Osmotic Pressure The Starling Equation Starling\\'s equation describes fluid movement across a capillary wall in terms of the balance of pressures described above. Kf is the filtration coefficient expressing how readily fluid can move across the capillary wall. It varies across tissues and types of capillaries, such that for a given pressure gradient, flow across the wall is high in capillaries with high Kf (ie glomerular capillaries in the kidney), and low with low Kf (ie cerebral capillaries). Note that this constant changes with capillary injury (ie burns, inflammation). Pc and Pi represent the hydrostatic pressures in the capillary and in the interstitial fluid, respectively Πc and Πi represent the osmotic pressures of the solution in the capillary (blood) and the interstitial fluid, respectively. In vivo, Pi is ~2 mm Hg and constant over the length of the capillary. Pc, on the other hand, starts high (~35 mm Hg) at the arteriole side of the capillary and falls to ~13 mm Hg at the venule side of the capillary. This the hydrostatic pressure gradient (ie the difference between Pc and Pi) changes along the length of the capillary. The difference between Πc and Πi is referred to as the osmotic pressure gradient. Because protein is the primary driver of osmotic pressure in the blood, the osmotic pressure gradient is often also referred to as the oncotic pressure gradient. This is because oncotic pressure is defined as the effective osmotic pressure contributed by protein. Proteins are present in the blood but not in the interstitial fluid. Because these proteins do not normally cross the capillary wall, the oncotic pressure is constant along the length of the capillary at ~25 mm Hg. This pressure is essential for the reabsorption of fluid along the venule side of the capillary. Because the hydrostatic pressure falls over the length of the capillary from a value that is greater than the osmotic pressure on the arterial side to a value that is less than the osmotic pressure of the venule side, the direction of net fluid flow reverses from filtration (moving out of the capillary) to absorption (moving into the capillary). Note that this arrangement is necessary in order for capillary exchange (delivering nutrients and removing waste from tissue) to occur. EDEMA Edema is a sign that normal exchange between the circulatory system and the lymphatics has been disrupted. There are two principal causes of edema: (1) more fluid flows out of the capillary than is reabsorbed, or (2) inadequate drainage of lymph. More fluid flows out of the capillary than is reabsorbed. Three factors disrupt the normal balance between capillary filtration and absorption: 1. An increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure. An increase in arterial pressure is generally not noticeable in the capillaries because of the 10  3 \\nmyogenic autoregulation that occurs in the arterioles that feed them. Thus, increased capillary hydrostatic pressure is usually due to elevated venous pressure. One common cause of increased venous pressure is heart failure, a condition in which one ventricle loses pumping power and can no longer pump all the blood sent to it. For example, if the right ventricle begins to fail but the left ventricle maintains its cardiac output, blood accumulates upstream of the right ventricle, in the systemic circulation. Blood pressure rises first in the right atrium, and then in the veins and capillaries that drain into the right side of the heart. When capillary hydrostatic pressure increases, filtration greatly exceeds absorption, leading to edema. 2. A decrease in capillary oncotic pressure. This primarily occurs by a decrease in plasma protein concentration secondary to conditions such as severe malnutrition or liver failure. The liver is the main site of plasma protein synthesis. These proteins are primarily responsible for the blood\\'s osmotic pressure (πc). If the oncotic pressure of blood falls, then the osmotic force that drives absorption decreases, and less fluid is reabsorbed from the interstitium. 3. A change in capillary wall permeability. This can cause excessive leakage of proteins from the blood to the interstitium (ie high Kf) , thereby reducing the osmotic pressure of blood and increasing the osmotic pressure of the interstitial fluid. As a result, less fluid is reabsorbed. Etiologies include burns, toxins such as certain chemotherapies, and inflammatory states such as infection. Inadequate Drainage of Lymph Inadequate lymph drainage occurs with obstruction of the lymphatic system, particularly at the lymph nodes. Parasites, cancer, or fibrotic tissue growth (ie from scarring or radiation) can block the movement of lymph through the system. For example, lymphatic filariasis (also called elephantiasis) is a parasitic disease that damages the lymphatic system, resulting in gross edema of the lower extremities. Another example is lymphedema after surgery, such as for patients who undergo axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. A potential complication of this procedure is chronic, ipsilateral (occurring on the same side) upper extremity edema.  3 11 \\n 12  3 \\nChapter 4 Electrophysiology Author: Shobha Stack, PhD, MD INTRODUCTION In order for the heart to expand and contract, the cells need to be electrically activated in a coordinated manner. Cardiac electrophysiology includes all the components that conduct electricity through the heart, allowing it to pump blood through the body. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Describe the major ionic conductions (ie Na+, K+, and Ca++) underlying automaticity in sinoatrial and atrioventricular node cells, and the action potentials of cardiac myocytes. Compare and contrast action potentials in SA node and AV node cells, cardiac muscle cells, and Purkinje cells. Explain the mechanism and importance of a long refractory period in the heart. Describe the effects of the Autonomic Nervous System on the firing rate of SA node THE CARDIAC CONDUCTION SYSTEM Cardiac conduction begins with an action potential at the sinoatrial (SA) node (Figure 4-1). The SA node is known as the pacemaker of the heart. It spontaneously generates action potentials under the influence of the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. This electrical activation is then conducted through the right and left atria and on to the atrioventricular (AV) node. Conduction in the AV node is much slower than in other tissues. This slowing allows for the atria to finish contracting blood into the ventricles before the ventricles receive the signal to contract themselves. The AV node sends the action potential down a specialized path starting with the Bundle of His, diverting to the right and left bundle branches along the ventricles, and finally into the smaller Purkinje fibers deep within the ventricular walls. The His-Purkinje system conducts the action potential quickly, rapidly spreading throughout the ventricular muscle cells. Its anatomical path allows for ventricular contraction from the bottom up, like a tube of toothpaste, to efficiently eject blood into the pulmonary and arterial systems. Clinical Correlate: What happens to stroke volume if conduction through the AV node were to speed up? More rapid conduction leads to less time to complete full ventricular filling and thus decreased stroke volume. When an electrical impulse follows this normal path of conduction from the SA node to the Purkinje fibers, and does so at a steady rate of 60-100 impulses per minute, this is known as normal sinus rhythm. Now that we understand cardiac conduction at the tissue level, let\\'s look further at the cellular level.  4 1 \\n Figure 4-1: The cardiac electrical conduction system. Electrical conduction starts at the SA node, then simultaneously depolarizes the atria, reaches the AV node, and continues on to the His-Purkinje system, stimulating coordinated contraction of the ventricles. Intra and Intercellular Electrical Conduction Recall that myocardial cells (or myocytes) contain long chains of sarcomeres (the contractile units of the cell) called myofibrils. The surrounding cell membrane is called the sarcolemma. The sarcolemma not only acts as a barrier between the intracellular and extracellular space, but also facilitates ion transport for transmission of electrical impulses (Figure 4-2a). The surface area of the sarcolemma is increased by deep invaginations into the cell called T tubules (or the transverse tubular system). By increasing the sarcolemma\\'s surface area, there is increased contact with the extracellular environment allowing for quick and synchronous transmembrane ion transport during myocyte contraction and relaxation. The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is an intracellular membrane that stores calcium ions and releases them into the sarcoplasm when stimulated by an excitatory electrical impulse (Figure 4-2b). The SR features sac-like ends called terminal cisternae that contain most of the calcium stores. These terminal cisternae abut the T-tubules and the outer sarcolemma. By maintaining close contact, they are prepared for the impending electrical impulses that will stimulate the release of their calcium stores, thereby activating contraction. Conduction between myocytes utilizes the SR as well as intercalated disks. Intercalated disks are regions of the sarcolemma that function as gap junction complexes between cells. They function as structural and electrical bridges 2  4 \\nbetween myocytes. The terminal cisternae of the SR also abut the intercalated disks allowing for excitation-contraction coupling at these sites. Notably, myocardial cells contain multiple mitochondria (35% of cell volume) to handle the immense metabolic demand of the heart. Figure 4-2a: Structure of a cardiac myocyte. Figure 4-2b: Magnified view of a cardiac myocyte. Ion Movement and Potentials Myocardial cells, like other muscle cells, are electrically polarized. Meaning they have an internal negative charge relative to the positive charge outside their membranes. The sarcolemma maintains this polarity by using ion channels, passive cotransporters, and active transporters as gatekeepers to the cell, selectively allowing the passage of ions to maintain the cell\\'s electronegativity. Notice in Figure 4-3 that the intercellular sodium concentration of a myocyte is 15 mM, while the extracellular sodium concentration is 145 mM.This concentration  4 3 \\ngradient creates a strong diffusive force of sodium into the cell that is regulated by the sarcolemma. Figure 4-3: Cardiac myocyte ion channels and transporters. In addition to the force of the concentration gradient, there is also the force created by the membrane resting potential. Recall that the resting potential is determined by the intercellular and extracellular difference in electrical charge. For a cardiac myocyte, the resting membrane potential is approximately -90 mV.This negative charge creates a strong attraction for the positively charged sodium ions to enter and stay in the cell, which is again regulated by the channels and transporters of the sarcolemma. Let\\'s look at these same forces for the potassium ion. The concentration gradient of potassium drives this ion out of the cell through continuously open ion channels. The membrane\\'s negative resting potential attracts the positively charged potassium ions back into the cell. The electrical potential at which these forces are balanced, causing zero net movement of potassium across the sarcolemma, is known as the potassium equilibrium potential. The potassium equilibrium potential, as calculated by the Nernst equation, is approximately -91 mV.Resting potentials for each ion are shown in Table 4-1. EK+ ENa+ ECl- -90.8 mV +60.6 mV -84.9 mV ECa2+ +100 mV Table 4-1: Ion equilibrium potentials in cardiac myocytes. 4  4 \\nion fluxes through that the sarcolemma In cardiac cells, the action potential is the change in membrane potential that propagates a signal to contract. Action potentials are created by a sequence of controlled follow a pattern of depolarization to repolarization. Depolarization means the membrane potential becomes less negative, while repolarization means the membrane potential becomes more negative in an attempt to return to its resting potential. While there are many ion currents involved in creating action potentials and restoring resting potentials in the heart, the currents listed in Table 4-2 are the most relevant to our discussion. These ion currents create action potentials differently depending on the electrophysiologic type of cardiac cell, of which there are three: pacemaker cells (SA node, AV node), specialized rapidly conducting tissues (Purkinje fibers), and ventricular and atrial myocytes. Ion Current Description Known as the \"funny current\" because, at the time of its discovery in 1979, this inward current activated on hyperpolarization, rather than other known currents at the time that activated on depolarization. It is a pacemaker current responsible for phase 4 depolarization in pacemaker cells The Na+ current is responsible for phase 0 rapid depolarization in non-pacemaker cells. The slow, long-lasting Ca++ current is responsible for phase 0 depolarization in pacemaker cells, and is the major contributor to inward current during phase 2 of non-pacemaker cells Maintains resting potential; this is the current of the inward rectifying potassium channels that are open in the resting state, thereby making the resting sarcolemma permeable to potassium Transient outward potassium current; responsible for phase 1 of action potential If INa ICa,L IK1 Ito IKs, IKr Delayed rectifier potassium currents of slow (IKs) and rapid (IKr) types; repolarizing currents that are active during phases 2 and 3 of action potential. Table 4-2: Cardiac Ion Currents to know.  4 5 \\nACTION POTENTIALS Cardiac Myocyte Action Potential In this section we will focus on the action potential of a ventricular myocyte, which is divided into phases. As shown in Figure 4-4, we start at phase 4 of the action potential, which is the resting state prior to depolarization. The inward ion currents are balanced with the outward ion currents. Note that the membrane potential is at -90 mV.Figure 4-4: A ventricular myocyte action potential. Phase 0 is the initial swift depolarization caused by rapidly opening membrane sodium channels. This in turn causes sodium ions to rush into the cell toward the negatively charged interior. The entry of these positively charged ions renders the membrane potential less negative. As the membrane potential becomes less negative, more sodium channels are triggered to open, promoting further entry. Once the membrane potential reaches its threshold potential of -70 mV, enough sodium channels have opened to create a self-sustaining inward sodium current (INa). This rapid upstroke lasts only a few milliseconds before the sodium channels just as quickly close. At this point, the membrane potential is now positive. Phase 1 is a brief current of repolarization. With INa now paused, the transient outward potassium current, Ito, causes an efflux of positive potassium ions, bringing the membrane potential from positively charged to nearly neutral at approximately 0 mV (Figure 4-5). Phase 2 is known as the plateau phase. This is a relatively long period of stable depolarized membrane potential. The stability is caused by the balance of inward calcium currents, ICa,L, with outward potassium currents, IKs and IKr. Notably, the calcium current, which flows through L-type calcium channels, began during phase 0, but due to the slow activation, they remained open much longer than sodium channels (Figure 4-5). This influx of calcium subsequently triggers the release of additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus stimulating myocyte contraction. It is also during phase 2 that the calcium channels slowly inactivate. While the calcium channels are closing, the delayed rectifier potassium channels remain open, creating an imbalance that leads to the repolarization of phase 3. 6  4 \\nPhase 3 is the final phase where the membrane potential returns to its resting potential. This is driven by the delayed rectifier potassium currents, IKs and IKr. Recall that through the preceding phases, the cell has built up a concentration of calcium and sodium ions and lost its original concentration of potassium ions. This is corrected by removing sodium and calcium ions via a Na+-Ca++ exchanger and a Ca++-ATPase calcium pump (Figure 4-3). Potassium is in brought back into the cell by a Na+K+-ATPase exchanger. Figure 4-5 shows the temporal relationship of the above-mentioned ion currents through the course of a cardiac action potential. Figure 4-5: Contributions of ion channels to the myocyte action potential. The currents on the left move into the cell, and the currents on the right move outward. Pacemaker Cell Action Potential Recall that the action potentials of myocytes are triggered by a wave of depolarization from neighboring cells via gap junctions. On the other hand, pacemaker cells (in the SA and AV nodes) generate their own depolarization! This rhythmic, spontaneous depolarization is known as automaticity. Although atrial and ventricular cells do not possess automaticity, they can develop this property in abnormal states such as stretching of the fibers or ischemia. Note the difference in shape between a pacemaker cell action potential (Figure 4-6) and a myocyte action potential (Figure 4-4). Phase 4 is not in a flat resting state, but rather a gradual state of depolarization. Pacemaker cell membranes are \"leaky,\" causing constant ion shifts, and thus an unstable resting membrane potential. As a result, the membrane potential only briefly reaches a low of -65 mV before re-entering depolarization. The gradual upward slope of phase 4 is attributed to the funny channel current, If (also known as the pacemaker current), which consists of an influx of positively charged sodium ions through the pacemaker channel. This is an unusual channel because it is turned on by hyperpolarization from the preceding action potential, thus guaranteeing that each action potential will be followed by another action potential. Note that the rate of phase 4 depolarization (ie the funny channel current) determines the heart rate.  4 7 \\nFigure 4-6: A pacemaker cell action potential. When a threshold potential of -40 mV is reached, phase 0 begins. As demonstrated by the slope of phase 0, this depolarization is less rapid than that of myocytes. The funny channels have now closed, and the L-type calcium channels gradually open to allow a relatively slow influx of calcium ions into the cell. Notice that there is no initial repolarization (phase 1 of myocytes). Also, due to the intrinsically unstable membrane potential, there is no plateau (phase 2 of myocytes). Rather, the action potential moves directly toward repolarization as the L-type calcium channels gradually close and the delayed rectifier channels open allowing an efflux of potassium ions out of the cell. Clinical Correlate: The SHIFT trial (2010) was a study that randomized patients with heart failure and a resting heart rate of >70 beats per minute to receive either ivabradine (a drug that inhibits the funny channel) or a placebo. The ivabradine cohort had less hospital admissions and deaths than the placebo group due to the drug\\'s effect on heart rate. What is the effect of ivabradine on heart rate? Use Figure 4-6 to prove to yourself that ivabradine slows heart rate. THE REFRACTORY PERIOD The refractory period is the period when a cell is unresponsive (refractory) to restimulation. In other words, it is unable to generate another action potential. This period can be divided into four stages (Figure 4-7). The absolute refractory period (ARP) spans phase 0 to the initial part of phase 3. During this period, most of the sodium channels that produced the rapid upstroke are now closed. The cell is thus unable to use these channels to create current required to generate another action potential. No stimulus is large enough to overcome this. 8  4 \\n Figure 4-7: Refractory period of a ventricular myocyte. Action potentials 1, 2, and 3 represent the action potentials that could be generated at the end of the effective refractory period, the relative refractory period, and the supranormal period respectively. The effective refractory period (ERP) extends further into phase 3. It is here that sodium channels begin to recover. At this point, generating a local action potential is possible, however, there are not enough open sodium channels to facilitate a large enough current to create an action potential that is capable of propagating to the next cell. Next is the relative refractory period (RRP) which extends from the end of the ERP to nearly the end of repolarization. At this point, even more sodium channels have recovered, allowing enough current to generate another action potential that is capable of propagating. However, such an action potential would require a larger stimulus than usual. If a second action potential is generated during the RRP, it will have a slower phase 0 due to the incomplete availability of all membrane sodium channels. During the last period, called the supranormal period (SNP), the cell is actually more excitable than normal due to the membrane reaching its resting potential. As a result, there is less current required to depolarize the cell to its threshold potential. Now that we understand how ion channels and transporters determine the shape (or phases) and duration of action potentials, we can see how the same channels and transporters determine the duration of the corresponding refractory period. Specifically, the longer the action potential, the longer the cell is refractory to being able to create another action potential. Atrial cells, ventricular cells and Purkinje fibers all use the same ion currents in their action potentials, but for different durations. An action potential lasts 150 msec in the atria, 250 msec in the ventricles, and 300 msec in Purkinje fibers. Thus, because Purkinje fibers  4 9 \\nhave longer action potentials, they are less excitable than atrial and ventricular cells. Clinical Correlate: How does defibrillation work? Now that we have discussed cardiac action potentials and the refractory period, we can explore ventricular fibrillation. When the conduction of the cardiac cells becomes uncoordinated in the ventricles, the walls no longer contract in an orderly manner. Rather, they tremble with scattered depolarizations throughout the ventricular walls. This is known as ventricular fibrillation. Why does this happen? Among many reasons, the most common is scarring of the myocardium from ischemia. This change in structure can intermittently disrupt the normal cardiac conduction pathway leading to uncoordinated depolarization in the ventricular walls. Remember your favorite medical television show where the doctor, face full of determination, dramatically yells \"clear!\" and places defibrillator paddles on the patient\\'s chest, sending the shock that brings them back to life? Now you can understand what is actually happening. The paddles send such a large amount of electricity to the heart, relative to each cell\\'s own action potential, that all the cells depolarize at the same time. As the cells start to repolarize, the \"leaky\" membranes of the SA node\\'s pacemaker cells allow these cells to finish repolarizing first and subsequently depolarize first, thus resetting the rhythm of the heart. THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THE HEART The Sinoatrial Node Recall that the SA node is stimulated by its own automaticity. The intrinsic rate of firing in the SA node is approximately 100 beats per minute. However, this can, and often is, altered by the autonomic nervous system (Figure 4-8). This alteration of the heart rate is known as a chronotropic effect. Sympathetic stimulation, mediated by norepinephrine, has a positive chronotropic effect. Norepinephrine activates beta1 receptors in the SA node, producing an increase in the funny current (If). This leads to faster phase 4 depolarization per unit time, as seen in Figure 4-8, and thus a quicker time to the threshold potential. By firing more action potentials per minute, the heart rate is concurrently increased. Parasympathetic stimulation is mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) and has a negative chronotropic effect. Acetylcholine activates M2 (muscarinic) receptors in the SA node, producing a decrease in If and an increase in IK-ACh. This leads to a slower phase 4 depolarization by If and a hyperpolarization by IK-ACh, pushing the cells further from threshold potential. These two obstacles slow the SA node\\'s ability to depolarize, thus leading to less action potentials per minute, and subsequently slowing the heart rate. 10  4 \\n Figure 4-8: The effect of the autonomic nervous system on pacemaker cell potentials. The Atrioventricular Node Recall that the AV node is where conduction slows to allow for completion of atrial contraction. The autonomic nervous system can alter this conduction speed through the AV node, also known as a dromotropic effect. Specifically, the sympathetic nervous system increases conduction velocity by increasing ICa, the current responsible for the quick depolarization of phase 0. This is a positive dromotropic effect. The parasympathetic nervous system slows conduction velocity by decreasing ICa and increasing IK-ACh. Clinical Correlate: The necessity of AV delay. Why is the baseline slow conduction of AV nodal cells, known as AV delay, essential for efficient cardiac output? Slowing down conduction at the AV node allows the atria to complete ejection of blood into the ventricles. Subsequently, by the time conduction passes through the AV node to the ventricles, the ventricles have received as much blood as possible from the atria to now pump forward into the lungs and systemic circulation.  4 11 \\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Figure 4-9: The cardiac conduction system and corresponding electrocardiogram Figure 4-9 illustrates what you have just learned about cardiac electrophysiology. At the top right side, you can see the pacemaker cell action potential at the SA node stimulating atrial contraction, reaching the AV node with a delay before the progressing through the His-Purkinje system to ventricular contraction. This figure also introduces the electrocardiogram (ECG) at the bottom right. Notice how the P wave corresponds to the wave of depolarization through the atria, and the QRS corresponds to the wave of depolarization through the ventricles. The T wave matches the repolarization phases occurring in the ventricles. The PR interval reflects the AV node delay, influenced by the dromotropic effects of the autonomic nervous system. The ECG will be discussed in more detail in the next section of this course. References: 1. Figure 4-1 was adapted from Costanzo LS.Physiology. 6th Ed. Elsevier; 2018. 2.

MYOCARDIAL CELL STRUCTURE Recall that the myocardial cell is made up of multiple bundles of myofibrils surrounded by mitochondria (Figure 5-1). Each myofibril is a chain of serially connected sarcomeres that extend from one Z line to the next Z line. Each sarcomere consists of thin filaments (actin), thick filaments (myosin), and titin (Figure 5-1). Figure 5-1: Myocardial cell and Sarcomere structure.  5 1 \\n Titin is a protein that tethers myosin to the Z line and provides elasticity, most significantly during diastole. Interestingly, it is also involved in stress-sensing signaling pathways that lead to cardiac hypertrophy as well as dilated cardiomyopathy. These are disease states you will learn about later in the course. Actin and myosin are the primary proteins of contraction (Figure 5-2). The thick filaments of myosin have globular heads featuring actin binding sites and ATPase. ATPase facilitates ATP hydrolysis, which subsequently activates myosin heads. Recall that there are a large number of mitochondria in cardiac myocytes available to provide a ready supply of ATP for this purpose. Figure 5-2: Myocyte cell contractile proteins. The thin filaments of actin include tropomyosin and troponin. These are the regulatory proteins of contraction. In the resting state, tropomyosin lays in the groves of actin, blocking interaction between actin and myosin heads. Troponin complexes sit along actin at regular intervals. Troponin is a protein complex made up of troponin I (TnI), troponin C (TnC), and troponin T (TnT). Troponin T links tropomyosin to actin. Troponin C binds calcium ions in order to allow the contractile process to occur. And finally, Troponin I inhibits the ATPase activity of actin-myosin cross-bridging. When calcium ions bind to TnC, this causes inhibition of TnI, thus allowing ATPase activity. Concurrently a conformational change in tropomyosin occurs, thereby exposing active sites between actin and myosin. The myosin heads are no longer blocked from forming a cross bridge with actin. EXCITATION-CONTRACTION COUPLING Perhaps you are wondering how calcium is able to reach TnC in order for contraction to occur. The answer lies in the action potential that stimulates the contraction. 2  5 \\n Recall from Chapter 4 that during phase 2 of the action potential, there is an influx of calcium ions through L-type Ca++ channels (Figure 5-3). This influx causes an increase in intracellular Ca++ concentration. While this is not enough calcium to trigger contraction, it is enough to trigger the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to release its calcium stores via calcium-sensitive release channels called ryanodine receptors on the SR.This process is known as calcium-induced calcium release. Thus, the amount of calcium released by the SR is determined by (1) the size of the inward Ca++ current during phase 2, and (2) the amount of calcium previously stored in the SR.Figure 5-3: Excitation-contraction coupling with calcium-induced calcium release Now that the intracellular calcium concentration has increased, there is a sufficient amount ready to bind TnC.Tropomyosin is subsequently moved, thus allowing actin and myosin cross bridges to both form and then break as the filaments slide past each other (Figure 5-4). This cycle of forming and breaking cross-bridges occurs as long as the intracellular calcium concentration is high enough to occupy binding sites on TnC.Thus, the intracellular calcium concentration also determines form. Consequently, the magnitude of the tension formed is determined by the intracellular calcium concentration. For example, a larger Ca++ concentration will allow more cycles of actin-myosin cross-bridging to occur, and thus, greater tension is developed. the number of cross bridges that  5 3 \\n Figure 5-4: Cross-bridge cycling. Relaxation occurs toward the end of phase 2 of the action potential (Figure 5-5). L-type calcium channels inactivate, thus halting the calcium influx and removing the trigger for calcium-induced calcium release from the SR.A fraction of calcium is removed through the sarcolemma by Na+-Ca+2 exchangers, and to a lesser extent by the Ca+2-ATPase pump. Most of the calcium, approximately 80%, reaccumulates back into the SR via sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca+2-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. Calsequestrin, a calcium-binding storage protein, helps maintain a low free Ca++ concentration inside the SR, thus reducing the work of the SERCA.Figure 5-5: Recovery-relaxation 4  5 \\n the major regulators of SERCA activity One of is a protein called phospholamban. When phospholamban is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect on the SERCA is diminished, allowing the SERCA to increase its uptake and storage of calcium in the SR.The increased uptake leads to a faster relaxation phase. Moreover, the increased calcium storage allows for greater SR calcium release on the next contraction, thus allowing the muscle to develop greater tension. CONTRACTILITY Contractility (or inotropy) is the intrinsic property of myocardial cells to develop force at a given muscle length. Agents that increase contractility are known as inotropes. Contractility is dependent upon intracellular calcium concentration. The greater the intracellular calcium concentration, the greater the contractility. As we learned in the prior section, intracellular calcium concentration is dependent on (1) the size of the inward calcium current, and (2) the amount of calcium stored in the SR.Processes that change these factors subsequently change contractility. An example of this is the effect of heart rate. When heart rate is increased due to sympathetic stimulation, this process is enhanced by the activation of beta1 receptors coupled to adenylyl cyclase. Among other actions, the activation of adenylyl cyclase leads to phosphorylation of two important proteins. The first is the sarcolemmal Ca++ channels. Phosphorylation of these channels increases the inward calcium current during phase 2 of the action potential, thus increasing trigger calcium for calcium-induced calcium release from the SR.Note that with this increase in calcium, there is concurrently a larger amount of calcium available to be stored in the SR during relaxation. The second phosphorylated protein is phospholamban, which leads to upregulation of SERCA, thus increasing the amount of calcium stored for release at the next action potential. An example of the effect of heart rate on contractility can be seen in Figure 5-6. This figure illustrates the positive staircase effect. In this example, when heart rate doubles, tension increases in a stepwise manner. This is because there are now twice the number of action potentials per minute, thus more total calcium entering the cell, and consequently more calcium available for SR storage which can be released for the next beat. Note that the first extra beat has the same tension as the prior beat. This is because extra calcium has not yet accumulated. However, with each beat thereafter, more calcium accumulates until a maximal storage level is achieved, and thus a maximal tension.  5 5 \\nFigure 5-6: The positive staircase effect of heart rate on contractility. LENGTH-TENSION RELATIONSHIP The basis of the length-tension relationship of cardiac muscle is illustrated in Figure 5-7. Panel A shows the resting and contracted states of muscle at fixed lengths. Panel B is a plot of the tension developed at rest and with a stimulus to contract at each corresponding length. Panel C is a graph of the tension developed at each length for the resting and contracted state. These three panels illustrate the two concepts of the length-tension relationship: (1) active versus passive tension, and (2) the relationship of length and the amount of active tension developed. The first concept is that of active and passive tension. Similar to a rubber band, there is a force required to stretch a resting muscle to different lengths (Panel A, Muscles 1, 3, and 5). This force is called passive tension because the muscle is passively stretching. The lower curve in Panel C graphs the passive tension at each length. When a muscle, set at a fixed length, is stimulated to contract (Panel A, Muscles 2, 4, and 6), this is called active tension. This is graphed as the difference between the curves in Panel C.For example, passive tension at the shortest length is the amount of tension between then x axis and point 1, while active tension at this length is the amount of tension between point 1 and point 2. Total tension is the sum of active and passive tension, and thus the value at point 2. The second concept is that the amount of active tension developed depends upon the muscle length at which it occurs. The length at which the greatest amount of active tension can be developed is called Lmax. Notice in Panel C that this is the middle muscle length. Interestingly we know that Lmax for cardiac muscle fibers is 2.2 um. The length of cardiac fibers at the end of diastole is just under this value at 1.9 um. Length dependent tension is thought to be due to three mechanisms: (1) the extent of overlap, (2) changing sensitivity to calcium, and (3) changing SR calcium release. 6  5 \\n Figure 5-7: Isometric contractions and the effect of muscle length on the development of active and passive tension. The first mechanism, the extent of overlap of the sarcomere\\'s thick and thin filaments at rest, is illustrated in Figure 5-7, Panel A.Notice the sarcomeres depicted next to each muscle length. The sarcomere for the shortest length (Muscle 1) has so much overlap between thin and thick filaments, that the thin filaments buckle on each other, thereby blocking a number of actin binding sites from forming cross-bridges with myosin. The longest sarcomere (Muscle 5) has only a small length of thin filaments overlapping with thick filaments. As a result, most of the actin binding sites are out of reach, and thus insufficient for optimal cross-bridge formation. Note that when a myocyte is stretched to this degree, it is titin that holds the sarcomere together (Figure 5-1). Muscle #3 is depicted as the optimal degree of overlap, allowing for myosin to reach an optimal number of actin binding sites.  5 7 \\nThe other two mechanisms can be simply stated. Increasing muscle length will immediately increase the calcium binding sensitivity of troponin C.Increasing muscle length will also increase calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after several minutes at that length. The details of these mechanisms are not fully understood, nor the extent to which each mechanism contributes to the length- tension relationship. The final point of our discussion is that the length-tension relationship for a myocardial cell can be extended to the ventricle to illustrate two concepts: (1) With an increase in ventricular volume, there is also an increase in the length and tension of each myocardial cell. Preload is the ventricular wall tension at the end of diastole and is approximated by the end-diastolic volume or the end-diastolic pressure of the ventricle. (2) As ventricular volume increases, the resulting total tension of each myocardial cell in the ventricular wall creates an intraventricular pressure. In order to eject blood from the ventricle, this intraventricular pressure must overcome the resistance opposing it (ie for a normal left ventricle and aortic valve, this is the systemic vascular resistance [SVR] and is approximated by the ventricular wall stress during systole and is determined by the resistance that the ventricle must overcome in order to eject blood. the systolic arterial pressure). Afterload is When the length-tension relationship is extended to the ventricles as above, we begin to see the mechanics of diastole and systole. This will be discussed further in Chapter 6: Ventricular Performance. FORCE-VELOCITY RELATIONSHIP The force-velocity relationship (Figure 5-8) of cardiac muscle is illustrated by the fact that you can pick up a pencil faster than you can pick up a 100-pound dumbbell. The force against which the muscle contracts (ie the dumbbell) is the afterload. The speed at which you are able to pick up the dumbbell reflects the speed of cross-bridge cycling. This speed is known as the shortening velocity of muscle (ie the speed at which a muscle shortens during a contraction). The force-velocity relationship states that as afterload increases, shortening velocity decreases (Figure 5-8A). In other words, you pick up the dumbbell slower than the pencil. From this, you can extrapolate that the maximal shortening velocity, Vmax, occurs when the afterload on the muscle is zero. 8  5 \\n Figure 5-8: The force-velocity relationship of cardiac muscle. The relationship depicted in Figure 5-8A is in the setting of fixed preload and contractility. If contractility were to increase, for example by administering norepinephrine, the curve would shift up and to the right (Figure 5-8B). If preload were to increase instead of contractility, the curve would also shift up and to the right, provided that the muscle fiber lengths are not stretched beyond Lmax. THE FRANK-STARLING LAW In 1894, German physiologist Otto Frank used a frog heart to first demonstrate the relationship between left ventricular systolic pressure and left ventricular end- diastolic volume (LVEDV). In 1918, British physiologist Ernest Starling built upon this concept. Using a dog heart, he demonstrated that the volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle during systole (stroke volume) is dependent on the LVEDV.From these experiments came the Frank-Starling law, which states that, with constant afterload and contractility, ventricular output increases with preload. This relationship is illustrated in Figure 5-9 and is known as the Starling curve (also known as a ventricular performance curve). LV end-diastolic volume (on the x-axis) is an approximation of preload. Stroke volume (on the y-axis) is an approximation of ventricular output. The LVEDV stretches the ventricular wall prior to contraction, creating passive tension. The more the fibers are stretched (up to a point, Lmax) the greater the contraction (active tension), resulting in greater stroke volume. When afterload or contractility are altered, the degree of this relationship is also altered (Figure 5-9). For example, when afterload is reduced, there is less resistance that the ventricle must work against. Thus, for a given LVEDV, stroke volume increases. When afterload is increased, there is greater resistance that  5 9 \\nthe ventricle must work against. Here, for a given LVEDV, stroke volume decreases. A change in contractility, on the other hand, results in a change in the total tension developed with contraction. Thus, an increase in contractility results in greater total tension and thus, greater stroke volume. Conversely, a decrease in contractility results in a decrease in stroke volume for a given LVEDV.Figure 5-9: The Starling curve (ventricular performance curve) and its response to changes in afterload or contractility. A healthy heart typically operates on the steepest part of the curve, where small changes in LVEDV result in significant changes in stroke volume. As you will see when we discuss heart failure later in the course, patients with myocardial damage have subsequent poor ventricular contractility. Their hearts operate on the flatter part of a flatter curve (ie the blue curve in Figure 5-9). That is, for any given change in preload, the effect on stroke volume is less. Our discussion of the length-tension relationship and of contractility explains the mechanism behind the Frank-Starling law. Looking at the larger picture of cardiac mechanics, we can now start to think about how the factors that influence preload, afterload, and contractility ultimately affect stroke volume. This will be explored further in Chapter 6. References: 1. Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.4 were adapted from Lilly LS.Pathophysiology of Heart Disease. 6th ed. Wolters Kluwer; 2016. 2.

Describe how stroke volume and ejection fraction change with preload, afterload, and contractility using a pressure-volume loop. Describe changes in chamber pressures and volumes throughout the cardiac cycle, including valve openings and closures, heart sounds, and periods of rapid ventricular filling and ejection. Compare the cardiac cycle to the surface ECG.  Describe how the venous pulse changes throughout the cardiac cycle. DEFINITIONS In Chapter 5, we introduced the concepts of preload, afterload, and contractility. In this chapter, we further discuss these variables and use them to predict stroke volume and thus, cardiac output. Preload is the ventricular wall tension at the end of diastole and is approximated by the end-diastolic volume of the ventricle. This concept can be thought of as the amount of myocardial stretch at the end of diastole, before contraction. From the Frank-Starling law, we know that the more a ventricle is distended (ie preload), the greater the volume ejected (stroke volume). Conditions that decrease preload are those that decrease intravascular volume (ie dehydration, hemorrhage, diuretics such as furosemide and spironolactone), mechanical maneuvers such as Valsalva, and administration of venodilating agents such as nitrates. Conditions the administration of intravenous fluid. Afterload is the ventricular wall stress during systole and is determined by the resistance that the ventricle must overcome in order to eject blood. This relationship can be illustrated through the Law of Laplace: increase preload that include 𝜎 = P x r 2h Where P is ventricular pressure, r is the inner radius of the ventricular chamber, h is ventricular wall thickness, and 𝜎 is the ventricular wall stress. From this equation we see that an increase in P, for example from an increase in systolic blood pressure, results in an increase in ventricular wall stress (ie afterload). Agents that increase afterload include alpha-agonists such as phenylephrine and norepinephrine. Agents that decrease afterload include vasodilators such as  6 1 \\n amlodipine, lisinopril, and losartan, whose use you will learn more about in Chapter 8. Contractility is the intrinsic property of myocardial cells to develop a force at a given length. Agents that increase contractility, such as digoxin or dobutamine, are known as inotropes. Conditions that decrease contractility include myocardial damage and the use of beta-blockers (ie metoprolol). Stroke volume the ventricle ( End Diastolic Volume - End Systolic Volume ) and is a function of the preload, afterload, and contractility of that ventricle (Figure 6-1). the volume of blood ejected is from Figure 6-1: The effect of preload, afterload, and contractility on stroke volume, and subsequently cardiac output. Cardiac output (L/min) is the volume of blood pumped by the heart into the circulatory system per minute, and a clinical marker of how we assess cardiac function. It is equal to stroke volume multiplied by heart rate. Finally, Ejection fraction (EF) is another indicator of cardiac function. EF is the percentage of blood at the end of diastolic filling that is ejected in one beat. A normal EF is 60-65% and is calculated as: EF = Stroke Volume End Diastolic Volume = (End Diastolic Volume - End Systolic Volume) End Diastolic Volume 2  6 \\nPREssURE-VOLUME LOOPS Pressure-volume (PV) loops are useful ways to model the effect of preload, afterload, and contractility on ventricular function throughout the cardiac cycle (Figure 6-2). Ventricular volume is represented on the x-axis and ventricular pressure is presented on the y-axis. Figure 6-2: Pressure-Volume loop for the Left Ventricle. Referring to Figure 6-2, the pressure-volume loop cycle starts at point a and moves through the cardiac cycle in a counter-clockwise fashion. Ventricular filling (a to b). At point a, the mitral valve opens, and diastolic filling begins, increasing ventricular volume from point a (end systolic volume, ESV) to point b (end diastolic volume, EDV). Notice how there is only a small change in ventricular pressure along this curve. This is because the ventricle is able to expand to accommodate the increase in volume. Isovolumetric contraction (b to c). At point b, diastolic filling stops due to closure of the mitral valve. This is both the end of diastole and the beginning of systole. From point b to point c, the left ventricle contracts against closed mitral and aortic valves. Notice that volume does not change (isovolumetric) because blood is unable to enter nor exit the  6 3 \\n ventricle. However, ventricular pressure increases as the ventricular wall contracts onto a fixed volume of blood in its chamber. Ventricular ejection (c to d). At point c, the ventricular pressure has increased enough to surpass the pressure on the other side of the aortic valve (ie the aortic pressure). Thus, the aortic valve opens, and blood is rapidly ejected, driven by the pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta. As the ventricle continues to contract, its volume decreases with the ejection of its contents. Contraction ends at point d, where the remaining volume is the ESV.  Isovolumetric relaxation (d to a). At point d, systole ends and diastole begins. The ventricle relaxes, decreasing ventricular pressure below aortic pressure, and the aortic valve closes. Because the mitral valve has not yet opened, blood does not enter the ventricle, and the volume remains constant. At point a, the ventricular pressure has fallen to below the left atrial pressure, allowing the mitral valve to open, and the cycle begins again. Viewing the PV loop as a whole, we can now see that systole is represented by b to c to d, and diastole is represented by d to a to b. Also noticed that stroke volume is represented as the distance between EDV and ESV.CHANGES WITH PRELOAD, AFTERLOAD, AND CONTRACTILITY The effect of preload, afterload, and contractility on stroke volume can be illustrated using PV loops. In this section, we will change one variable while holding the other two variables constant, to demonstrate that variable\\'s effect on the PV loop. 4  6 \\nChanges in Preload If preload increases (while holding afterload and contractility constant), then end diastolic volume, which is a surrogate of preload, increases as well. This increase in preload is reflected by a right shift of the isovolumetric contraction line (Figure 6-3). Similarly, a decrease in preload will shift the isovolumetric contraction line to the left. Notice how preload does not affect ESV.Thus, an increase in preload will increase EDV while ESV remains constant, resulting in a greater stroke volume. This is consistent with the Frank-Starling Law. Figure 6-3: The effect of increasing preload (1 to 2 to 3) on the PV loop.  6 5 \\n Changes in Afterload If afterload increases (while holding preload and contractility constant), for example in conditions such as hypertension or aortic stenosis, then the left ventricular pressure generated increases as well. This is reflected by an upward shift of the ventricular ejection curve (Figure 6-4). Figure 6-4: The effect of increasing afterload (1 to 2 to 3) on the PV loop. Notice how EDV remains the same because there is no change in preload. However, because more work is expended to overcome the higher afterload, there is less contraction. Thus, contraction ends at a higher ESV, resulting in a lower stroke volume. The point where contraction ends is determined by the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR). The ESPVR is analogous to the total tension curve derived from the length-tension relationship in Chapter 5. It reflects the end- systolic volume that the ventricle is able to achieve for a given ventricular pressure. 6  6 \\nChanges in Contractility If contractility increases (while holding preload and afterload constant), a greater volume of blood is ejected, resulting in a lower ESV.The increase in contractility is reflected by the steeper slope of the ESVPR.Thus, for any given preload or afterload, the ventricle empties more completely. This greater emptying is reflected by the leftward shift of the isovolumetric relaxation line (Figure 6-5). Notice also that with a lower ESV, stroke volume has increased. Figure 6-5: The effect of increasing contractility (1 to 2) on the PV loop.  6 7 \\n PHARMACOLOGY APPLICATIONS Now that we understand how preload, afterload, and contractility affect the heart, we can use this knowledge to our advantage when treating patients. Below is a summary of how drugs are typically used to manipulate cardiac mechanics. These applications will be explored further in the lectures and conference on heart failure. Property Effect Drug Increase IV fluids Preload Afterload Decrease Increase Decrease furosemide (diuretic) spironolactone (RAAS drug that acts as a diuretic) phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and other alphA-agonists lisinopril, losartan (RAAS drugs), hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate*, sacubitril (vasodilator) Contractility Increase digoxin, milrinone, dobutamine Decrease metoprolol, carvedilol *isosorbide dinitrate is more commonly used for afterload reduction, however, can also have the side effect of decreasing preload through venous dilation. Pharmacological effects on preload, afterload, and contractility. THE CARDIAC CYCLE The cardiac cycle refers to the events occurring in the heart over the course of a single beat. This includes systole, the period of ventricular contraction and ejection, and diastole, the period of ventricular relaxation and filling. At a heart rate of 72 bpm, the cycle is approximately 0.8 seconds, with 0.3 seconds for systole and 0.5 seconds for diastole. Throughout this time, there are changes in the pressure and volume of each chamber. Figure 6-6 illustrates the cardiac cycle including aortic pressure, left ventricular (LV) pressure, left atrial (LA) pressure, and left ventricular volume. Systole is represented by phases B through D, and diastole by phases E through A.Starting from left to right, this section will go through each phase. 8  6 \\n Figure 6-6: The Cardiac Cycle  6 9 \\n A.Atrial systole. This phase represents left atrial contraction. Here, the ventricle is relaxed as it fills with blood from the atrium through the mitral valve. Notice in phase G that the ventricle was already filling with blood from the atrium, however, in phase A, the atrium actively contracts to further increase ventricular volume. The peak in pressure during this phase is the additional volume added to the ventricle from atrial contraction. This corresponds to the fourth heart sound, S4, which is typically not audible, but may be heard in abnormal states where the ventricle is stiffened, such as in ventricular hypertrophy. B.Isovolumetric contraction. Systole begins here as the ventricle contracts. The mitral valve closes when LV pressure surpasses LA pressure. Because blood can neither enter nor exit the ventricle, ventricular pressure increases rapidly with contraction until the aortic valve opens. Notice during this phase that the ventricular volume curve is flat, indicating its isovolumetric state. The first heart sound, S1, is heard during this phase, representing closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves (the AV valves). S1 may also be split since the mitral valve closes slightly before the tricuspid valve. C.Rapid Ventricular Ejection. As the ventricle continue to contract, LV pressure now surpasses aortic pressure, thus opening the aortic valve and allowing for ejection of blood. Because ventricular contraction is still occurring, ventricular pressure is still increasing. With the aortic valve open, the left ventricle and aorta are now a single chamber with equal pressures. Meanwhile, LA pressure is rising as the left atrium fills with blood from the pulmonary vasculature. D.Reduced Ventricular Ejection. Here longer contracting, so LV pressure begins to fall. Since LV pressure is still sufficient for the aortic valve to remain open, blood will still exit the LV, further reducing ventricular volume. LA pressure continues to increase with atrial diastole. the ventricle is no E.Isovolumetric relaxation. Diastole begins here. LV ventricular pressure falls below the aortic pressure, thus allowing the aortic valve to close. As the ventricle relaxes, ventricular pressure steeply falls. Because no valve is open to allow blood to enter nor exit, the ventricular volume curve is flat during this phase. Notice the aortic pressure has a slight increase at the beginning of this phase. This is known as the dicrotic notch and is attributed to the closure of the aortic valve. The second heart sound, S2, is heard during this phase representing closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. Because the aortic valve closes slightly before the pulmonic valve, this sound can be split. Maneuvers that increase venous return to the right side of the heart will delay pulmonic valve closure, thus splitting S2 more prominently. F.Rapid ventricular filling. When LV pressure drops below LA pressure, the mitral valve opens, and the ventricle will begin to fill with blood from 10  6 \\nthe left atrium. Ventricular volume increases rapidly, yet ventricular pressure does not. This is because the ventricle is relaxed and compliant (ie able to stretch to accommodate the increasing volume). Notice that LA pressure is equal to LV pressure due to the open valve between them, resulting in one chamber. The third heart sound, S3, may be heard during this phase and is attributed to the rapid flow of blood into the ventricle. S3 is heard normally in children, due to their brisk ventricular filling and robust ventricular relaxation. However, in adults, an S3 is abnormal and may indicate an overfilled ventricle which could be a sign of heart failure. This will be discussed further in Chapter 8. G.Reduced ventricular filling. This is the longest phase of the cardiac cycle and is also referred to as diastasis. Here ventricular filling is slower. The ventricle is nearly full and atrium nearly empty, resulting in a less steep ventricular volume curve. Notice how LV pressure only slightly increases with filling due to ventricular wall compliance. THE CARDIAC CYCLE AND ECG Figure 6-6 can be further expanded to include an ECG tracing (Figure 6-7). 1. P wave. Starting with the P wave, which represents atrial depolarization, notice how this precedes atrial contraction (phase A). 2. PR interval. Phase A is the period of atrial contraction, which is represented by the PR interval. 3. QRS Complex. Phase B begins with ventricular contraction which occurs during ventricular depolarization, represented by the QRS complex. 4. T wave. The ventricle completes contraction in phase C and starts relaxation in phase D, corresponding to ventricular repolarization, represented by the T wave. Using this expanded figure, we can better visualize how changes in heart rate affect the cardiac cycle. An increase in heart rate will reduce the time before the next P wave. As a result, phase G will be decreased, resulting in less time for passive ventricular filling, and thus a lower EDV.Lower EDV means lower preload, and thus, from the Frank-Starling Law, lower stroke volume. Unless the heart is able to compensate by increasing contractility or decreasing afterload, this will result in decreased cardiac output. This can occur with arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, which we will discuss later in the course.  6 11 \\n 12 Figure 6-7: The Cardiac cycle with heart sounds and ECG. 6 \\nVENOUS PULSE The venous pulse is the pressure from the atrium that is reflected back to the veins. We use this concept in the physical exam when we measure jugular venous distention to assess if blood is inappropriately not moving forward from the right atrium to the right ventricle. You will learn more about this maneuver in Foundations of Clinical Medicine. Figure 6-7 depicts the venous pulse throughout the cardiac cycle. This is shown in more detail in Figure 6-8, with a concurrent ECG tracing to show where in the cardiac cycle each point occurs. Figure 6-8: Venous pulse through the Cardiac Cycle. The venous pressure tracing is shown in green, and ECG tracing is shown in blue. Starting from left to right, the venous pulse progresses from the a wave, to the c wave, x descent, to the v wave, followed by the y descent. Figure 6-9 shows what is happening in the right side of the heart at each step. In this section, we will discuss the venous pulse in the context of the right side of the heart and the jugular vein. However, keep in mind that these concepts also apply to the left side of the heart.  6 13 \\n Right atrial (RA) pressure is a function of the volume of blood it contains and the level of contraction onto that volume. The jugular venous pulse described below is a reflection of RA pressure. The a wave occurs during right atrial contraction. The increase in RA pressure from its contraction is reflected back to the jugular vein as the a wave. The peak of the a wave occurs at peak atrial contraction. The c wave is from tricuspid valve closure during right ventricular (RV) contraction. Specifically, this wave represents the increase in pressure from the bulging of the tricuspid valve toward the RA as it closes in early ventricular systole. The x descent reflects relaxation of the RA and thus a decrease in RA pressure. The v wave indicates an increase in RA pressure as it passively fills with the tricuspid valve remaining closed. The y descent occurs with opening of the tricuspid valve. Blood passively moves from the RA into the RV.Note that this is prior to atrial contraction reflected by the next a wave. Figure 6-9: The Right Atrium (RA), Right Ventricle (RV), and Pulmonary Artery (PA) at each stage of the Venous Pulse. Note that when you see jugular venous pulsations on physical exam, you are actually seeing the peak of the a wave (peak atrial contraction) and the peak of the v wave (peak RA filling). 14  6 \\nSUMMARY This chapter described how three important variables (preload, afterload, and contractility) affect stroke volume, and subsequently cardiac output. This relationship can be modelled using pressure-volume loops to predict the effect on cardiac output. We will revisit this concept again in the course when we discuss heart failure to help us understand the clinical consequences of this condition. Pressure and volume tracings throughout the cardiac cycle will also be used later in the course to understand the effect of valvular disease on cardiac function. Finally, by understanding the components of the venous pulse, you will be able to translate this to the physical exam to diagnose a variety of clinical conditions including arrhythmias, heart failure, cardiac tamponade, and valvular disease (all discussed in future lectures).

Elsevier; 2018.  6 15 \\n 16  6 \\nCardiac output refers to the volume of blood pumped by the heart into the circulatory system per minute. It is an important diagnostic parameter in assessing patients in a variety of clinical scenarios. For example, cardiac output is decreased in conditions such as heart failure, severe mitral valve regurgitation, and hypovolemia, and increased in conditions such as pregnancy, exercise, severe anemia, severe infection, and hyperthyroidism. More emergently, the assessment of cardiac output aids in determining the etiology of shock and, as a result, aids in treatment decisions. The goal of this chapter is to understand the three primary methods used to estimate cardiac output: stroke volume, Fick cardiac output, and thermodilution. Note that cardiac output is often represented with the term Q rather than the abbreviation CO noted above. This term will be used in the pulmonary portion of CPR. Before we discuss methods of measuring cardiac output, it is helpful to discuss the means by which oxygen is distributed to the body by the circulatory system. The heart delivers oxygenated blood and nutrients to the tissues. The amount of oxygen (O2) delivered depends on cardiac output and on the concentration of oxygen in the blood (more formally referred to as the \"oxygen content\"). The amount of oxygen extracted and consumed by the tissues depends on the amount delivered relative to the metabolic activity of the tissue. As a result, the oxygen content of venous blood leaving the tissues is less than the oxygen content of the arterial blood entering the tissues. The Fick principle states that the amount of a substance consumed by an organ is equal to the amount that enters the organ via arterial blood, minus the amount that leaves the organ via venous blood. Applying this to the cardiovascular system as a whole, we can deduce that the amount of oxygen consumed by tissues is equal to the arterial oxygen content minus the venous oxygen content. In this sense, all O2 is accounted for. Oxygen content is the concentration of oxygen in the blood (CO2), and is determined by the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and the amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood. Note that CO2 in this case refers to the oxygen content of the blood, rather than carbon dioxide. This concept will be explored in greater detail in the Pulmonary portion of this course. The oxygen content of blood leaving the heart and traveling in the arterial system is referred to as the arterial oxygen content and is denoted by CaO2. VO2 is the rate of oxygen consumption by the tissues and varies as a function of metabolic activity. It can be measured by collecting exhaled gases while a patient is breathing spontaneously or with the help of a ventilator, or estimated from prediction equations (125 ml/O2/min/m2 body surface area). The latter method is far less accurate than measurements made through collection of exhaled gases The oxygen content of the blood returning to the lungs is typically measured in the pulmonary artery and is referred to as the mixed venous O2 contest (CvO2). The term \"mixed venous\" refers to the fact that it represents all the venous blood returning to the heart that merges from the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, and the coronary veins. When we refer to \"mixed\" venous blood, the subscript v has a bar over it. If we are referring to venous blood in other locations, a simple subscripted v is used. The venous oxygen content is lower than the arterial oxygen content due to oxygen consumption by the tissues. Oxygen delivery through the arterial circulation is determined by cardiac output (CO) and arterial oxygen content (CaO2), the latter a function of hemoglobin (Hb), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). VO2 is the rate at which tissues consume oxygen. The remaining oxygen is transported through the venous circulation, back to the heart and lungs. Venous oxygen content is represented by CcvO2 in the central veins, and by vO2 in the pulmonary artery. Note that if there is a left-to-right intracardiac shunt (for example, an atrial septal defect where oxygenated blood moves from the left atrium into the right atrium), the mixed venous O2 content is no longer accurately measured in the pulmonary artery. In these cases, mixed venous O2 content is estimated from one of the central veins - the inferior or superior vena cava - and is referred to as CcvO2, where the subscript \"cv\" refers to central vein. Normal cardiac output is about 5 L/min. In clinical practice, this measure is typically normalized for the patient\\'s body surface area, to yield the cardiac index (CI). There are three methods by which we can estimate cardiac output. Cardiac output is a function of heart rate and stroke volume and can be expressed as follows: Given that: we then have CO = SV x HR. SV = EDV - ESV. CO = (EDV - ESV) x HR. EDV and ESV can be measured using several techniques including ultrasound (echocardiography), magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide scintigraphy, and contrast angiography. The details of these techniques are beyond the scope of this course. This method of cardiac output measurement is inaccurate if there is significant valve regurgitation or a significant abnormal communication (often referred to as a \"shunt\") between the systemic and pulmonary circulations. In such cases, we must instead consider the effective stroke volume of the left ventricle. This is the amount of blood that is actually pumped into the aorta and out to the systemic circulation from the left ventricle (LV). For example, in patients with mitral regurgitation, a portion of the LV stroke volume moves in retrograde fashion across the mitral valve into the left atrium. In this case, the effective stroke volume is the portion of the stroke volume that exits the LV across the aortic valve. Another example is that of a patient with a ventricular septal defect. Here, a portion of the LV stroke volume crosses the interventricular septum into the right ventricle during systole. The effective stroke volume is only that portion of the stroke volume that exits the LV across the aortic valve. Finally, in a patient with a regurgitant aortic valve, the effective stroke volume from the LV will be that portion of the stroke volume that does not leak back across the aortic valve during diastole. The Fick principle can be used to calculate the Fick cardiac output. The difference between these values (CaO2 - CvO2) is referred to as the arteriovenous oxygen (AVO2) content difference. This relationship highlights an important principle. Assuming VO2, Hb, and PO2 of the arterial blood are constant, if cardiac output increases, the AVO2 difference becomes smaller because more oxygen is delivered to the tissues than needed to satisfy metabolic demand. The tissues respond by extracting less oxygen from each unit of blood that passes through their capillary bed. Conversely, if cardiac output falls, the AVO2 difference increases; in the face of decreased oxygen delivery, the tissues must extract a larger portion of oxygen from the available blood passing through the capillaries in order to satisfy metabolic needs. As a result, the oxygen content of the blood leaving the tissues is decreased, thereby increasing the AVO2 difference. We can directly measure oxygen content, but this requires an arterial blood gas to determine the PO2, as well as a hemoglobin concentration measurement. A simpler method, which does not require a blood draw for each measurement, is to use oxygen saturation as a surrogate measure for the oxygen content. You will recall that the hemoglobin-oxygen saturation represents the percentage of hemoglobin binding sites occupied by oxygen at a given time. It can be directly measured from a blood sample (referred to as co-oximetry), or by using a probe applied to the skin (referred to as pulse oximetry). If we assume an individual has a normal hemoglobin concentration and normal arterial oxygenation, the arterial saturation provides a reasonable surrogate measure of oxygen content and can be substituted into the Fick Equation. Analogous to the first Fick equation, a large arteriovenous oxygen (AVO2) saturation difference indicates decreased cardiac output, whereas, a small arteriovenous oxygen (AVO2) saturation difference indicates either high cardiac CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 7 5 \\noutput or decreased tissue oxygen extraction. This concept will be discussed further in Chapter 10 on Shock and again in the pulmonary portion of CPR.Thermodilution Effective cardiac output can also be estimated using a technique, known as Thermodilution, that relies on a catheter whose tip resides in the pulmonary artery (Figure 7-2). A small amount of cold saline is injected from a side port of the catheter into the right atrium (blue arrow), while the change in temperature of the blood is measured by a thermistor located downstream at the tip of the catheter in the pulmonary artery (black arrow). Figure 7-2: Thermodilution. Cold fluid (blue) is injected from a port of the catheter into the right atrium (blue arrow). A thermistor at the tip of the catheter (black arrow) resides in pulmonary artery and records the temperature of the blood flowing from the right atrium to the pulmonary artery. A curve representing the change in temperature of the blood at the tip of the catheter over time can be plotted. The area under the curve (Figure 7-3) is then used to estimate cardiac output. For example, with a large cardiac output, the cold fluid is pumped rapidly past the thermistor, so the area is small. Thus, cardiac output is inversely proportional to the area under the thermodilution curve. 6  7 \\n Figure 7-3: Thermodilution curves. The plot shows the absolute value of the temperature drop from normal (y-axis) over time (x-axis) following a bolus of cold injectate. There is a greater area under the curve for lower cardiac output states. Although this method has been well-validated to measure cardiac output, there are two conditions that lead to error. The first is tricuspid regurgitation. This abnormality causes retrograde flow of blood) and the cold saline from the right ventricle, back to the right atrium, resulting in delayed cooling of the pulmonary artery. This would result in an underestimation of cardiac output. The second source of error is an intracardiac shunt. An intracardiac shunt is the deviation of blood flow from its normal pattern of flow through the heart, often due to a defect in the atrial or ventricular septum. The defect results in blood flow directly between the atria or ventricles respectively, with less blood reaching the pulmonary artery where the thermistor is located. If blood and cold saline are shunted from the right to the left side of the heart, less saline reaches the pulmonary artery, resulting in a faster peak temperature drop at the thermistor, and thus an overestimation of cardiac output. If blood is shunted from the left to the right side of the heart, more blood reaches the pulmonary artery, resulting in a slower peak temperature drop at the thermistor, and thus an underestimation of cardiac output. This method will be discussed further in Chapter 10. You will not be expected to do measurements of cardiac output using this technique in this course but should understand the principles behind the method. Intracardiac shunts will be discussed further in Chapter 15 on Congenital Heart Disease. SUMMARY The decision as to which method to use, the Fick method or thermodilution, depends on the patient\\'s location and available equipment (ie a cardiac catheterization lab versus ICU), as well as the patient\\'s pathology as mentioned above. Below is an example of calculating the cardiac output of a patient in the ICU using the Fick method. CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 7 7 \\n\\nCase Example A patient is admitted to the ICU with shock following admission for pneumonia. Labs are drawn, and a pulmonary artery catheter is placed with the following results: Measurement Result Source CvO2 C__O2 SvO2 SaO2 Hemoglobin V O2 55 ml O2 100 / ml blood Pulmonary artery catheter 70 ml O2 100 / ml blood Arterial blood gas 83% Pulmonary artery catheter 92% by pulse oximeter Pulse oximeter 13 g/dl (130 g/L) 250 ml/min Complete blood count Estimated Question 1: Using measurements of oxygen content, what is their cardiac output? CO = V O2 CaO2 - CvO2 = 250 70 - 55 = 16.66 L/min. This is a high cardiac output. Question 2: Using measurements of oxygen saturation, what is their cardiac output? This is because the second method of estimating cardiac output uses oxygen saturation as a surrogate measure for oxygen content and these values are not equal to each other. As a result, we see that both methods yield a high estimate of cardiac output but not the same exact value.\\n\\nChapter 8 Heart Failure Author: Richard K.Cheng, MD INTRODUCTION At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Define the epidemiology and outcomes in heart failure. Recognize the classification schemes that are commonly used when discussing heart failure. Understand the pathophysiology of heart failure. Compare the clinical presentation of left and right sided heart failure with respect to the physical examination, laboratory values, and imaging. DEFINITION Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome characterized by the structural or functional impairment of filling of the heart ventricles or the inability of the heart to pump sufficient blood. This leads to two major issues: (1) the inability for blood to move forward normally results in blood backing up into the lungs (from the left ventricle, LV) or into the extremities and abdomen (from the right ventricle, RV) and (2) decreased forward blood flow means decreased perfusion of organs. HF is not a specific disease entity, but rather, a common final pathway for a wide variety of cardiovascular disease states. Any process that compromises the ability of the heart to pump adequate blood can be considered HF.In the developed world, and particularly in the United States, HF is frequently due to coronary atherosclerosis or long-standing hypertension. Cardiomyopathies (primary heart muscle disease resulting from genetic or other factors) are also common causes of HF.Manifestations of HF include dyspnea and fatigue, which limit the ability to exercise and can limit routine daily activities. Patients can also have fluid retention leading to either left-sided symptoms (pulmonary congestion) and/or right-sided symptoms (splanchnic congestion and peripheral edema). EPIDEMIOLOGY Approximately 5.1 million people in the United States carry the diagnosis of HF and many more have the condition but are undiagnosed. More than 650,000 new cases of HF are diagnosed annually. HF is the most common reason for admission of the elderly to acute care hospitals in the United States and results in a large economic burden. In total, HF accounts for more than 1 million hospitalizations annually. At a time when most cardiovascular diseases are declining, the prevalence of HF is increasing (Figure 8-1). This is due in part to aging of the population, as the incidence of HF increases sharply with each passing decade of life. Additionally, improvements in diagnosis and treatment of hypertension and acute myocardial  8 1 \\ninfarction, two common conditions contributing to the development of HF, have led to improved survival in these cohorts. Decreased mortality results in a larger at-risk population for development of HF.Moreover, survival after diagnosis of HF is also improving, which contributes to the increasing HF prevalence. Figure 8.1: The projected prevalence of HF in the United States. Health Care Costs In 2013, the estimated annual cost of HF care in the US exceeded $30 billion, with more than half the costs spent on hospitalizations. The 1-month risk of hospital readmission is approximately 25% for patients hospitalized with HF.Direct costs (cost of medical care) are expected to increase at a faster rate than indirect costs because of early mortality. Figure 8-2: Projected increase in direct and indirect costs attributable to HF Mortality Although survival rates for heart failure have been improving due to advances in medical and surgical treatment, mortality remains high at 50% at 5 years for all HF patients,2 and is even higher for patients who have been admitted to a 2  8 \\nhospital.3 Variables that influence survival include clinical factors such as etiology, increasing symptom severity, and decreasing functional capacity. Hemodynamic factors influencing survival include decreased ejection fraction (EF, percentage of LV emptying with each cardiac cycle), high ventricular filling pressures, low cardiac output, and high afterload. Biochemical factors such as elevated levels of norepinephrine, renin, plasma vasopressin, troponin-I, and B- type natriuretic peptide (BNP) also predict a poor prognosis. Finally, the presence of cardiac arrhythmias can have an adverse effect on survival. DEFINITIONS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Reduced versus Preserved Ejection Fraction in HF HF is a clinical syndrome that can result from disorders of LV dysfunction (either systolic or diastolic), the heart valves, the pericardium, metabolic function, or the great vessels. Thus, it is important to emphasize that HF is not synonymous with systolic dysfunction, as a wide spectrum of abnormalities may result in clinical HF.EF is often utilized to classify HF patients due to differing demographics, comorbidities, prognosis, and response to therapies within these groups (Table 8-1). The AHA/ACC 2013 guidelines recognize several distinct groups, with the most important being HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) and HF with reduced EF (HFrEF). Table 8-1: AHA/ACC 2013 Classification of HF by Ejection Fraction. In systolic dysfunction (HFrEF), impaired pump function of the heart (due to weak heart muscle) leads to reduced cardiac output and secondarily to increased filling pressures. The most common etiologies of HF due to systolic dysfunction include hypertension, myocardial ischemia, diabetes, myocarditis (inflammation), toxins, or genetic disorders involving myocardial proteins. Many cases of systolic dysfunction are of unknown etiology and labeled \"idiopathic\". HFrEF is the better- studied and more homogenous form of HF, accounting for ~50% of all cases. Conversely, the primary abnormality in many patients with diastolic dysfunction (HFpEF) is related to impaired myocardial relaxation which leads to elevated  8 3 \\nfilling pressures. By definition, EF is normal in these patients. Stroke volume and cardiac output are initially preserved but often fall as ventricular volumes are reduced. The most common etiology is hypertension, which leads to increased LV wall thickness and a reduction in left ventricular relaxation. Other etiologies include infiltrative or hypertrophic diseases of the myocardium, or any process that results in fibrosis. Mortality for HFpEF is high but survival is slightly better than for patients with HFrEF (Figure 8-4). Figure 8-3: Distribution of ejection fraction in incident heart failure Figure 8-4: Mortality for HFrEF relative to HFpEF.Valvular abnormalities Clinical heart failure may also occur in the absence of either systolic or diastolic abnormalities of cardiac muscle, such as in the presence of significant valvular abnormalities. The stenosis of intra-cardiac valves can result in chronic pressure overload due to inability of blood to move forward. The regurgitation of intra- cardiac valves can lead to chronic volume overload, as blood constantly leaks backwards. 4  8 \\n ADAPTIVE AND MALADAPTIVE PATHWAYS Adaptive mechanisms in heart failure are controlled by neurohormonal changes that occur rapidly in response to a decrease in cardiac performance. In acute decompensated heart failure, adaptive mechanisms such as vasoconstriction and salt and water retention lead to a beneficial increase in vital organ perfusion. However, in chronic heart failure these same adaptations become maladaptive, leading to progressive decline in cardiac performance and the development of systemic and pulmonary vascular fluid overload. Neurohormonal changes include the activation of (1) the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and (2) the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and (3) the release of BNP.Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) Activation of the SNS occurs early in HF, stimulating (1) beta1-adrenergic receptors to increase heart rate and contractility, and (2) stimulating alpha1-adrenergic receptors to vasoconstrict systemic veins and arteries. With this comes an increase in myocyte size with LV remodeling. The SNS also activates the RAAS via beta1-adrenergic receptors in the kidney that promotes salt and water retention. Notably, elevated plasma norepinephrine levels are a marker of poor prognosis. Although helpful at first, chronic SNS activation can cause arrhythmias and eventually results in downregulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. In the long-term, these initially adaptive mechanisms are detrimental as excessive SNS activity is toxic to the heart, due to increasing myocardial oxygen demand in an already compromised state. Reflex control mechanisms become abnormal in HF.There is increased vasoconstriction due to inappropriate parasympathetic regulation, blunted heart rate response to exercise, and altered baroreceptor feedback. Patients develop orthostasis and decreased functional capacity with slow heart rate recovery. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) With HF, there is also activation of the RAAS pathway in the heart, brain, and vasculature that initially serves a compensatory mechanism. With activation of the RAAS pathway, angiotensin-I is cleaved by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce angiotensin-II (Figure 8-5). This resultant peptide contributes to a number of effects: vasoconstriction, myocyte growth and hypertrophy, activation of fibroblasts with resultant myocardial fibrosis, norepinephrine release, sodium and water retention, increased release of aldosterone and arginine vasopressin. Initially, these changes are compensatory because they serve to preserve organ perfusion in the setting of decreased cardiac output in HF by maintaining blood pressure and increasing circulating volume. However, chronically, RAAS activation is detrimental due to an increased workload for an already weakened heart and results in fluid overload with pulmonary congestion and retention of  8 5 \\nvolume peripherally. There is also progressive fibrosis and negative remodeling of the heart. Figure 8-5: RAAS pathway in Heart Failure. JGA is juxtaglomerular apparatus and GFR is glomerular filtrate rate, both of which you will learn more about in the Renal portion of CPR.B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) activation In HF, BNP is released from the myocardium in response to increases in wall tension and wall stretch in the ventricles. BNP acts as a vasodilator with diuretic and natriuretic properties and helps to offset the activity of the SNS and RAAS.Thus, BNP is often referred to as a \"counter regulatory\" hormone. Clinically, we trend BNP as a marker of fluid overload because more volume in the body increases ventricular wall stretch leading to higher BNP values. Thus, BNP can be helpful in evaluating volume status and correlates directly to the severity of HF.Other adaptive and maladaptive pathways Retention of sodium and water With progressive HF there is a proclivity toward increased sodium and water retention, with resultant signs and symptoms of systemic and pulmonary congestion including pulmonary edema, dyspnea (difficulty breathing), orthopnea (dyspnea when supine), ascites, and peripheral edema. Among several presumed mechanisms, effect is presumed to be due to a reduction in renal blood flow from decreased cardiac output, with compensatory attempts to increase effective circulating volume via RAAS pathway and SNS activation. Over time, there is progressive renal insufficiency from these combined mechanisms because of decreasing renal perfusion gradient. The release of vasopressin compounds this problem by decreasing free water clearance causing hyponatremia and vasoconstriction. Thus, the need for volume (fluid) expansion (to maintain blood flow to end-organs, including the kidneys) are achieved by the kidneys and myocardium, but with resultant systemic and pulmonary congestion. 6  8 \\nInflammation in HF Inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of HF.Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and proinflammatory cytokines including TNF- alpha and several interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-18), are associated with worse outcomes. Oxidative stress results in unbalanced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and results in myocardial damage. Table 8-2: Neurohormonal responses to impaired cardiac function. CARDIAC FUNCTION Preload Preload is defined as the ventricular wall tension at the end of diastole (prior to contraction) and is dependent upon venous return to the heart. Conditions that increase venous return subsequently increase preload. Such conditions include intravenous volume resuscitation, supine position, skeletal muscle contraction, and deep inspiration. Conversely, decreased venous return leads to decreased preload. This occurs with dehydration, diuresis, upright position, and increased intrathoracic (Valsalva or positive pressure ventilation) or intrapericardial pressure (tamponade). Preload can be approximated by the end- diastolic volume (EDV) or pressure (EDP). The more meaningful measure of ventricular preload is the EDV.The EDP has direct clinical application because it can be directly measured in a clinical setting by placing a catheter into the heart. As discussed in Chapter 5, there is a direct relationship between preload and cardiac output. An increase in preload leads to an increase in cardiac output, assuming afterload and contractility (ie inotropy) are held constant. This holds true up to an optimal preload condition, after which a higher preload will result in vascular congestion. In HF, a failing ventricle (with reduced systolic function) is less preload sensitive than a normal ventricle, such that any increase in preload will lead to a smaller increase in stroke volume and thus, a smaller increase in cardiac output. This is reflected in Figure 8-6 where the HF curve, compared to the normal curve, is displaced down and to the right, and is flattened.  8 7 ResponseShort term effectsLong term effectsbeta1-adrenergic receptor stimulation(increase HR and Contractility)Increases cardiac outputIncreases energy expenditure and promotes myocardial cell deathalpha1-adrenergic receptor stimulation(Vasoconstriction)Maintains blood pressure for vital organ perfusionExacerbates cardiac pump dysfunction, excessive afterload, increases cardiac energy expenditureNa+ and water retentionAugments preload and effective circulating volumePulmonary and systemic congestion\\nFigure 8-6: The Frank-Starling Curve Conversely, with an increase in inotropy (such as with exercise) or a decrease in afterload, the curve will shift upward and to the left. In this group, there is a larger increase in cardiac output for any incremental increase in preload. Afterload Afterload is defined as ventricular wall tension during systole and is determined by the resistance that the ventricle must overcome in order to eject blood. It can be approximated by systolic blood pressure, or more accurately by estimating systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Afterload is elevated in cases of increased blood pressure, reduced arterial elastance (\"stiff\" arteries such as with diffuse atherosclerosis), or LV dilation (ventricular dilation increases wall stress, which increases afterload on individual muscle fibers). Figure 8-7 shows the relationship between afterload (SVR) and cardiac output. When preload and contractility are held constant, a decrease in afterload will produce an increase in cardiac output. An increase in preload or contractility will also increase cardiac output and shift the curve upward and to the right. Note in Figure 8-7 that a failing ventricle (in HF) is more afterload sensitive than a normal ventricle, so that for any given increase in afterload, there will be a disproportionately greater decrease in cardiac output. Contractility is the intrinsic property of cardiac myocytes to develop force (of contraction) at a given length. Inotropes increase contractility, while negative inotropes decrease contractility. The effect is difficult to measure in vivo as cardiac output is dependent not only to contractility but also on preload and afterload. Hence, we look at integrated cardiac performance. INTEGRATED CARDIAC PERFORMANCE Pressure Volume Loops Pressure volume loops (Figure 8-8) are a useful tool for understanding the relationship between ventricular volume and pressure during the cardiac cycle. The maximal volume during the cardiac cycle is the end-diastolic volume (EDV), while the minimal LV volume is the end-systolic volume (ESV). Stroke volume (SV) is the difference between EDV and ESV.The base of the loop is formed by the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR), which describes the ventricle during diastole. The linear slope of the change in pressure for a given change in volume at end systole (near the top left of loop) is the end-systolic pressure volume relation (ESPVR). ESPVR serves as a surrogate for contractility. With mild heart failure, the ventricle dilates and there is an increase in end diastolic volume and pressure. Stroke volume can be maintained or mildly reduced with these changes. However, with progressive heart failure (Figure 8-9), there is a decrease in contractility. Despite increases in EDV, the SV cannot be maintained. With the increase in EDV, decrease in the SV, and decrease in contractility, ejection fraction and cardiac performance drops. The normal ventricle (solid black) is compared to a ventricle with systolic dysfunction (dashed blue). The decreased cardiac contractility (represented by the shift in the end- systolic pressure-volume relation, ESPVR, from line 1 to line 2) results in decreased end-systolic pressure and increased end-systolic volume (ESV). As normal venous return is added to this increased ESV, there is a subsequent increase in end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-diastolic pressure, and overall decrease in stroke volume (SV). Figure 8-10: Pressure-volume loop in diastolic heart failure. The normal ventricle (solid black) is compared to a ventricle with diastolic dysfunction (dashed blue) resulting from increased ventricular wall stiffness. The end- diastolic pressure-volume relation (EDPVR) is shifted upward (from line 1 to line 2) so that for any diastolic volume, the ventricular pressure is greater than normal. This results in decreased EDV (arrow) due to reduced filling of the stiffened ventricle at higher than normal end-diastolic pressures, and decreased SV. 8 11 \\nCLINICAL ASPECTS OF HEART FAILURE There are several descriptive terms used to differentiate among manifestations of heart failure. Right sided HF versus Left sided HF refers to whether the signs and symptoms are due to dysfunction of the right or left ventricle respectively. The term biventricular failure applies if both ventricles are affected. Biventricular heart failure most commonly occurs when right sided HF is the result of progressive left sided HF.Acute decompensated HF is acutely decompensated and fluid overloaded. Chronic HF is if they have long-standing but stable HF.This is pertinent because the clinical manifestations and treatments differ. There are 2 classification systems used to describe heart failure. The New York Heart Association (NYHA) class is based on symptoms and the ACCF/AHA is based on severity. Patients can move backwards and forwards within the NYHA classes, but only one direction (A to D) through the ACCF/AHA Stages. Certain NYHA classes correlate with a given ACCF/AHA stage (Table 8-3). the patient refers to whether Table 8-3: AHA/ACCF Stages and corresponding NYHA Classes 12  8 ACCF and AHA stageDescription of ACCF and AHA stageNYHA classDescription of NYHA functional classificationAAt high risk of heart failure but without structural heart disease or symptomsNonen/aBStructural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of heart failureINo limitation of physical activity; ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of heart failureINo limitation of physical activity; ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms of heart failureIISlight limitation of physical activity; comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity results in symptoms of heart failureIIIMarked limitation of physical activity; comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of heart failureIVUnable to carry on with any physical activity without symptoms of heart failure, or symptoms of heart failure at restDRefractory heart failure requiring specialized interventionsIVUnable to carry on with any physical activity without symptoms of heart failure, or symptoms of heart failure at restCStructural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of heart failure\\nSymptoms of Heart Failure Symptoms of HF are those that the patient describes and clinically can be ascertained by obtaining a history. They can be due to systemic or pulmonary venous congestion (\"wet\") due to fluid overload and RV and LV failure, respectively, and/or low cardiac output with reduced forward flow (\"cold\"), because of the inability of the weakened heart to pump blood effectively. Symptoms of pulmonary venous congestion (fluid backs up into the lungs due to LV failure): 1. Exertional or rest dyspnea (difficulty breathing) 2. Cardiac cough, most notable nocturnally (from fluid in the lungs) 3. Orthopnea (shortness of breath that occurs when lying flat, patients will often prop up the head of their bed or sleep with multiple pillows beneath their head) 4. Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (severe shortness of breath while sleeping that awakens the patient, causing them to sit up gasping for air) Symptoms of systemic venous congestion (fluid backs up into the body due to RV failure): 1. Dependent edema (fluid in the legs and buttocks) 2. Abdominal bloating and/or ascites 3. Anorexia and/or nausea from GI congestion 4. Right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort from hepatic congestion Symptoms of low cardiac output (the weakened myocardium cannot pump enough blood to vital organs): 1. Generalized fatigue and weakness (poor blood flow to skeletal muscles diffusely) 2. Confusion and anxiety (from poor cerebral perfusion) 3. Anorexia (from poor GI perfusion) 4. Decreased urine output (from poor renal perfusion) Signs of Heart Failure Signs of HF are findings on physical examination of the patient. These can be caused by abnormalities of the heart from remodeling, low cardiac output (\"cold\") or pulmonary or venous congestion (\"wet\"). (Figure 8-11). Signs of cardiac abnormalities 1. A laterally displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI) is a sign of cardiac enlargement (due to LV dilation) 2. An S3 gallop is an early diastolic sound of ventricular filling (this is an extra heart sound caused by oscillation of blood back and forth between the walls of the ventricles) 3. A loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound (P2) is related to pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary pressures are increased due to higher LV pressures which effectively transmit into the lungs) 4. A systolic murmur of mitral or tricuspid regurgitation is commonly present and is due to stretching and dilation of the mitral or tricuspid annulus (the annulus stretches out and even though the valves are normal, the leaflets cannot coapt (come together) normally)  8 13 \\n Figure 8-11: Assessment of heart failure. Patients can be rapidly triaged based on their signs and symptoms. They are well-compensated if they are \"warm\" (adequate cardiac output) and \"dry\" (not fluid overloaded). They are in the worst state when \"cold\" (low cardiac output) and \"wet\" (fluid overloaded). Signs and symptoms of fluid overload low cardiac output (hypoperfusion) are described above. Signs of pulmonary venous congestion (due to LV failure): (congestion) and 1. A rapid respiratory rate (tachypnea) is a manifestation of an increased work of breathing (due to fluid in the lungs, patients have trouble breathing and breathe faster to compensate) 2. Pulmonary rales/crackles are heard symmetrically in the lower lung fields (these are caused by the popping open of small airways and alveoli collapsed by fluid) Signs of systemic venous congestion (due to RV failure): 1. Jugular venous distention is one of the most important signs of right sided heart failure as it is a direct \"window\" to the central venous or right atrial pressure (this is measured by looking at the internal jugular vein with the patient seated at a 45-degree angle; higher venous distention suggests more systemic venous congestion) 2. Pleural effusions are often caused by elevated central and systemic venous pressures impeding lymphatic drainage and increased hydrostatic pressure in the veins 3. Dependent edema 4. Hepatomegaly and ascites 14  8 \\nSigns of low cardiac output 1. Peripheral vasoconstriction and decreased blood flow result in cool extremities 2. Resting heart rate is often rapid and represents a compensatory tachycardia. Since each stroke volume in HF is lower, the heart needs to beat more rapidly in attempts to maintain a normal cardiac output. 3. Low systolic blood pressure and a reduced pulse pressure are manifestations of reduced stroke volume 4. Renal failure from relatively poor renal perfusion Routine imaging and laboratory findings Electrocardiography (ECG) findings in most cases of HF are non-specific. Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm abnormality seen, although ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias may occur. Atrial or ventricular chamber enlargement may be seen in the form of conduction delay (including bundle branch block). When HF is due to coronary artery disease, evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction may be seen. The QRS voltage may be normal, increased (in the case of myocardial hypertrophy), or reduced (in the case of with infiltrative diseases or extensive myocardial infarction). The chest x-ray in HF will commonly show an enlarged cardiac silhouette and signs of pulmonary congestion but is rarely able to establish etiology with the exception of valvular heart disease and congenital abnormalities. Blood tests may be used to search for unusual but potentially reversible etiologies of heart failure (eg. thyroid abnormalities, iron overload, autoimmune conditions, specific viral serologies, amyloidosis, vitamin deficiencies) or to monitor response to therapy (renal and liver function, electrolytes). BNP can be useful for following a patient\\'s volume status, since increased volume will lead to increased BNP.Dedicated evaluation of the patient with heart failure Echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart) is one of the most useful tests in the evaluation of patients with suspected or confirmed HF and should be performed in all such patients. Subsequent evaluation will be modified depending upon the suspected etiology. Stress testing or coronary angiography are frequently performed to evaluate for coronary artery disease as the cause of the abnormal ventricular function. Cardiac MRI is useful to better characterize cardiac anatomy and to evaluate for inflammatory or infiltrative processes. Cardiac biopsy is rarely utilized and should not be routinely performed in patients with HF.It is reserved for patients with high clinical suspicion for specific types of inflammation (ie myocarditis) or infiltration (ie amyloidosis).  8 15 \\nTREATMENT OF SYSTOLIC HEART FAILURE Acute decompensated versus chronic heart failure management The management of heart failure varies depending on whether the presentation is acutely decompensated or chronic. In acute decompensated heart failure, the focus is to stabilize the patient and to relieve symptoms. This is achieved by: 1. Diuresis to relieve the patient of symptoms of congestion. Diuretics remove excess fluid in the body so the patient will feel better. This is effective in left sided HF (relieving pulmonary congestion), right sided HF (relieving peripheral edema and ascites), and biventricular HF.2. Unless the patient is in shock, afterload reduction is used to increase stroke volume and cardiac output. This is achieved with vasodilators. By decreasing peripheral resistance, the already weakened heart does not need to work as hard to eject the same volume forward. Thus, reducing afterload will increase cardiac output. 3. Increasing contractility in select cases (ie when the patient is in cardiogenic shock) is achieved with inotropes. This is a temporary measure to stabilize the patient. Long-term use of inotropes is detrimental and will increase mortality risk by increasing arrhythmia burden and cell death. Moreover, the weakened heart cannot tolerate the additional workload over time. Management of chronic heart failure focuses on long-term reduction of cardiac workload to give the myocardium a chance to rest, and thus provide the best chance of recovery over time (similar to letting your muscles recover after a strenuous work-out). This is achieved by: 1. Diuresis to maintain an optimal fluid balance. Although patients are less sensitive to small volume shifts as they become acclimated to being chronically volume overloaded, too much fluid will still result in congestive symptoms. 2. Afterload reduction remains important in the long-term setting in order to chronically reduce cardiac workload. 3. The main difference in acute decompensated vschronic management of HF is that in chronic HF management, we want to downregulate the neurohormonal RAAS and SNS systems. These systems are increased in the acute decompensated setting to promote end-organ perfusion but over time the myocardium cannot keep up this higher workload and the heart will continue to fail. Thus, we want to break this cycle by blocking the RAAS and SNS systems so that the heart can rest and recover. Numerous clinical trials have shown that neurohormonal downregulation of the RAAS and SNS systems improve cardiac function and survival. 16  8 \\nFigure 8-12: Summary of acute decompensated heart failure and chronic heart failure management. SURGICAL TREATMENT OF HEART FAILURE Revascularization Patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease may have depressed contractility due to myocardium that is chronically deprived of adequate blood flow. Ejection fraction and cardiac output may improve in these patients following revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to restore myocardial perfusion. To identify patients who may benefit from this treatment, myocardial viability screening is sometimes performed to determine if the myocardium is still recoverable or if it is irreversibly scarred. Tissue that is viable means that the myocardial cells are still \"alive\" whether they are normally functioning or hibernating because they are still alive but do not receive enough blood flow. Tissue that is nonviable suggests scarring, in which case restoring blood flow will not improve heart function as scar tissue cannot regenerate normal functioning myocardium in the heart. Valve surgery Repair or replacement of defective valves can preserve or improve ventricular function and improve signs and symptoms of heart failure. The most common valve operations are for relief of aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. Aortic valve disease is often treated by valve replacement with either bioprosthetic or mechanical valves. For high risk surgical patients with aortic stenosis, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option which does not require a complete sternotomy nor cardiopulmonary bypass. TAVR is performed with catheters rather than a major surgical incision through the sternum. Surgical mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation (MR) is also common. Although this can improve clinical symptoms by decreasing the backflow of blood into the lungs, it often results in a drop in EF due to loss of the backwards flow of blood. Mitral valve repair is superior to mitral valve replacement as the  8 17 \\nsubvalvular apparatus including chordae and papillary muscle architecture is preserved. The diagnosis and management of valvular diseases will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 12. References: 1.

CARDIOMYOPATHIES The cardiomyopathies are a heterogenous group of diseases with primary involvement of the myocardium, usually unrelated to pericardial, hypertensive, congenital, valvular or ischemic disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies them into three major categories based on functional impairment: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) - Inflammatory (myocarditis) o Viral infections o Noninfectious (hypersensitivity, cardiotoxic drugs, collagen vascular disease) - Metabolic (nutritional deficiencies) - Toxins (alcohol, cocaine, catecholamine excess, anthracyclines) - Familial - Peripartum - Severe obesity - Persistent tachycardia Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Restrictive / Infiltrative Cardiomyopathy (RCM) - Amyloidosis - Hemochromatosis - Sarcoidosis - Familial Table 9-1: Categorization of cardiomyopathies. Although there have been several updated classification schemes by the American Heart Association and the European Society of Cardiology, we will refer to the WHO classification for the purpose of this course since it is clearer to conceptualize than the newer systems.  9 1 \\nDILATED CARDIOMYOPATHIES Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by dilation of the ventricles and depressed contractility. There is myocyte apoptosis and necrosis, fibrosis, and neurohormonal upregulation. The prevalence of DCM is 36 per 100,000. Figure 9-1: Dilated Cardiomyopathy. Note the enlargement of all cardiac chambers, including the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), left atria (LA) and right atria (RA). The wall thickness of the LV and RV are typically normal or thinner than normal. DCM is a large group of heterogenous myocardial disorders. There are many infectious and noninfectious causes, with viral infection being the most common. The precise mechanism is not well understood, but is believed to be due to autoimmune-mediated injury. The spectrum of presentation varies from subclinical to rapidly progressive fulminant myocarditis with acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Metabolic causes include nutritional deficiencies such as beri-beri (thiamine deficiency) or endocrine abnormalities such as hyper- or hypothyroidism. There are agents that are directly toxic to the myocardium. These include alcohol, cocaine, and antineoplastic agents (classically anthracyclines). Excess catecholamines are directly toxic. This can be due to sudden excessive stress tumor (pheochromocytoma) from an adrenaline secreting reactions or genetic mutations leading to a familial form of DCM account for 20-30% of all cases of this disease. Miscellaneous causes can include peripartum (pregnancy-related) cardiomyopathy, obesity, and persistent tachycardia. Clinical manifestations of DCM are similar to those of systolic dysfunction. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms, prevent complications, and improve long-term survival. Identification and correction of an underlying abnormality should always be pursued, as normalization of ventricular function can sometimes be achieved after treating the underlying abnormality. Medical therapy for DCM is aimed at treating the associated systolic heart failure. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited cardiovascular disease, with a prevalence of 1 per 500. It is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. HCM is characterized by inappropriate myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of a recognized stimulus such as systemic hypertension or aortic stenosis. Typically, the septum is most affected in HCM. The left ventricle is the most affected chamber and is markedly thickened due to abnormal myocyte hypertrophy. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, diastolic abnormalities predominate with abnormal relaxation and increased left ventricular chamber stiffness. Unlike DCM, systolic function is often normal in these patients. Mitral regurgitation is common and is due to the altered geometry of the left ventricle and the mitral support apparatus. Myocardial ischemia can occur and is due to an increase in oxygen demand secondary to hypertrophy and abnormalities of the microvasculature. Thus, an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand is present. Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction can result from systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. Specifically, with the distortion of the mitral apparatus, the mitral valve impedes blood flow out of the left ventricle, decreasing cardiac output. Anything that increases contractility or decreases the LV chamber size will worsen the degree of obstruction. There can be a variable clinical course: The most typical symptoms of HCM are exertional dyspnea, exertional chest pain, and exercise intolerance. Dizziness, pre-syncope, and syncope with exertion also occur. These symptoms occur due to the thickened myocardium and movement of the mitral valve obstructing outflow from the left ventricular outflow tract, effectively decreasing circulating blood volume in the systemic vasculature. Symptoms can initially occur at any phase of life, from infancy to old age. A long period of stability is common and up to 25% of pts with HCM live to 75 years of age or older. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the most frequent mode of premature death in this disorder. Risk factors for sudden cardiac death include spontaneous, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), family history of HCM-related SCD, presence of a high-risk mutant gene, and unexplained syncope particularly in young patients, those with exertional syncope, or those with recurrent syncope. Treatment of HCM differs from treatment for traditional heart failure (HF). First- line therapy includes the use of pharmacologic agents to lessen the severity of the LVOT obstruction and to decrease contractility. Care should be taken to avoid maneuvers which decrease the size of the LV cavity (such as diuresis) or which increase the force of contraction (such as positive inotropes, which can worsen LVOT obstruction). When medical therapy is insufficient, and patients with an outflow tract gradient remain symptomatic, surgical methods to reduce the thickness of the ventricular walls are considered. RESTRICTIVE AND INFILTRATIVE CARDIOMYOPATHIES (RCM) RCM is the least common type of cardiomyopathy in the U.S.In RCM, there is increased fibrosis of the myocardium or deposition of foreign materials, resulting in increased stiffness of the ventricular walls that restricts diastolic relaxation and decreases ventricular filling. Clinically, severe diastolic dysfunction is the predominant problem. Unlike DCM, systolic function is usually normal in RCM.Patients with RCM will have classic signs and symptoms of biventricular dysfunction. The reason is not due to decreased cardiac output. Rather, the stiff LV results in increased filling pressures and backup of fluid into the lungs. The stiff RV results in backup of fluid into the extremities and abdomen. Treatment of RCM focuses on maintaining an optimal fluid balance with diuresis to alleviate symptoms. 4  9 \\nChapter 10 Mechanisms and Treatment of Arrhythmias Author: William A.Catterall, PhD, and Melissa Robinson, MD INTRODUCTION The chapter is divided into three sections: (1) the basic mechanisms of arrhythmia, (2) the main antiarrhythmic medications including their mechanisms of action, therapeutic indications and toxicities, and (3) general approaches to arrhythmia management. At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Outline the major classes of antiarrhythmic medications and describe their mechanism of action Outline a treatment approach for the management of bradyarrhythmias Outline a pharmacologic approach to the management of the major forms of tachyarrhythymia Describe the different forms of atrial fibrillation and outline a treatment approach for this arrhythmia Describe the clinical indications for pacemakers and defibrillators ARRHYTHMIA MECHANISMS Arrhythmias develop as a result of cellular, genetic, pharmacologic and electrophysiologic abnormalities. Cellular Pathologies That Cause Arrhythmias There are several pathologies at the cellular level that lead to arrhythmia: Abnormal Autonomic Regulation Several forms of abnormal autonomic regulation contribute to arrhythmia development: Excessive sympathetic tone: This occurs with sinus tachycardia, a rapid heart rate, with normal sinus rhythm. An example of this is pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes epinephrine Excessive parasympathetic tone: This occurs with sinus bradycardia, a slow heart rate with normal sinus rhythm. An example includes central nervous system-driven excess parasympathetic/vagal outflow because of epilepsy, infection, etc. AV block: atrial action potentials without ventricular action potentials. This can be caused by excess parasympathetic tone acting on the AV node. Tissue Malformation Abnormal conduction pathways may arise in development or in response to tissue injury. An example of this phenomenon is Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in which an abnormal tissue pathway allows impulses to return from AV node to atria. Tissue Damage and Remodeling Ischemia, infarction, infection, cardiomyopathy, etc. can cause cell injury and result in depolarization of the membrane potential and alteration of electrophysiological properties. Such injured electrically abnormal myocytes can generate slowly rising,  10 1 \\nslowly conducted action potentials that are arrhythmic. Anti-arrhythmic drugs work by targeting these damaged cells preferentially, allowing them to stop arrhythmias without stopping electrical conduction in the heart entirely. Genetic Causes of Arrhythmias Genetic mutations in cardiac ion channels can cause arrhythmias (Figure 10-1). Often, these mutations are inherited, and multiple generations of family members are affected. Rarely, mutations may arise de novo in an individual whose parents lack the mutation. Usually, these are dominant diseases caused by mutation of one allele. Two well-known inherited syndromes are Long QT Syndrome and Brugada Syndrome. Figure 10-1: Timing of Ionic Currents in the Ventricular Action Potential In Long QT Syndrome, mutations in several different molecular targets prolong the ventricular action potential and therefore cause prolonged QT intervals seen in an ECG.The most common mutations are: 1. Long QT Syndrome Type 1: Mutation in the Kv11.1 channel (also called hERG, human ether-a-go-go related channel) which conducts the rapidly activated K+ current IKr. 2  10 \\n2. Long QT Syndrome Type 2: Mutation in the Kv7.1 (also called KvLqT1), which conducts the slowly activated K+ current IKs. 3. Long QT Syndrome Type 3: Mutations in Na channels, but these mutations impair the fast inactivation of sodium channels, cause sustained Na current during the plateau phase of the action potential and in that way, prolong the ventricular action potential and cause prolonged QT intervals. in the K+ channels (LQT1 and LQT2) slow Loss-of-function mutations repolarization, prolong the ventricular action potential, and predispose patients to fatal ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations in at least nine other genes also cause Long QT Syndrome, but they are rare. Brugada Syndrome is caused by loss-of-function mutations in Na channels, which cause uneven action potential propagation in different parts of the ventricle. This inhomogeneous, uncoordinated conduction leads to arrhythmias. Drug Induced Long QT Syndrome The KV11.1 (hERG) channel is blocked by many types of drugs as an off-target side effect. In many cases, this involves binding in the pore of the channel and physically blocking it. This drug side effect predisposes the patient to fatal ventricular arrhythmias, just like genetic Long QT Syndrome. It is important to be aware that there are many commonly used drugs with this side effect, including: Procainamide (Class 1A antiarrhytmic) Amiodarone (Class III antiarrhytmic) Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin (antibiotics) Fluconazole (antifungal) Haloperidol (antipsychotic) Fluoxetine (antidepressant) Ondansetron (antiemetic) Methadone (opioid) Drugs aimed at a wide range of molecular targets can cause drug-induced Long QT Syndrome. This potential side effect requires careful screening of new drugs by pharma companies for hERG block. Electrophysiological Abnormalities There are several electrophysiologic abnormalities that lead to arrhythmias. Failure of impulse formation In sinus bradycardia (Figure 10-2) or sinus arrest, the spontaneous depolarization of the sinus node simply fails to occur, and a beat is delayed. This may be due to pathologic changes within the myocardium, autonomic tone, or pharmacologic effects. Most sinus bradycardia is asymptomatic and requires no therapy. However, some patients may present with fatigue, exercise intolerance or syncope.  10 3 \\nFigure 10-2 Sinus bradycardia Failure of impulse propagation (block) An example of impulse propagation failure is second degree AV block Here, the delay can occur in the AV node (Mobitz I) or the infra-Hisian Purkinje system (Mobitz II). The arrhythmia can be paroxysmal and patients may be asymptomatic or it may manifest with symptoms similar to sinus bradycardia. Figure 10-3: Mobitz Type II AV block. Intermittently non-conducted sinus P waves and a wide QRS complex during conducted beats. Automaticity Automaticity is increased spontaneous depolarization (Figure 10-4A). This may be normal in the case of sinus tachycardia during exercise or physiologic stress. It may be abnormal in the case of atrial tachycardia or repetitive premature ventricular beats (PVCs). Triggered activity Depolarizations that occur within the normal repolarization phase of the action potential (Figure 10-4B) are triggered activity. They are further characterized as early (associated with action potential prolongation, eg torsade de pointes with prolonged QT) or late (usually associated with calcium overload, as in the case of digoxin toxicity). 4  10 \\n B A Figure 10-4: Automaticity. Panel A shows spontaneous depolarization (b) quickly occurring after the initial depolarization (a). Panel B shows multiple early depolarizations (triggered activity) within Phase 3 of the action potential. Reentry Reentry is a cause of many common clinical arrhythmias (AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, AV reentrant tachycardia, atrial flutter. and many ventricular tachycardias). It involves two pathways with variable conduction properties. Typically, an early impulse propagates in the antegrade (forward) direction down one pathway (alpha) but finds the other pathway (beta) refractory. If conduction is slow enough down the initial pathway (alpha), the blocked pathway may recover conduction in time to be depolarized in the retrograde (backward) direction. This wave may then, again, depolarize the initial pathway (alpha), thus setting up reentry. Figure 10-5 illustrates this phenomenon in the AV node, when dual AV nodal physiology is present. Reentrant rhythms are often of abrupt onset and offset and can be symptomatic to life threatening. They are amenable to a variety of therapies discussed below. Figure 10-5: AV Node Reentry. Panel A: Normal sinus rhythm propagating through both pathways of the AV node. The slow pathway of the AV node (alpha) has slower conduction properties but repolarizes more quickly. The fast pathway (beta) has the opposite characteristics (faster condition properties but repolarizes more slowly). Panel B: A premature beat blocks conduction in the fast pathway but conducts slowly (depicted by the squiggly line) through the slow pathway. Panel C: The fast pathway has recovered and is depolarized in the retrograde direction, thus setting up reentry within the AV node (ANVRT).  10 5 \\nANTIARRHYTHMIC MEDICATIONS The following questions will be discussed in lecture. Consider these as you read this section of the chapter: 1. How is it possible to block sodium channels without stopping the heart? 2. Why is amiodarone widely prescribed despite its complex pharmacokinetics and adverse side effects? 3. How do rate control and rhythm control differ from each other? Why are both important? 4. Why is adenosine effective against most atrial arrhythmias but not atrial fibrillation? 5. Why do verapamil and diltiazem have frequency-dependent block whereas dihydropyridines (ie nifedipine) do not? Treatment of arrhythmias involves two stages: (1) conversion of the arrhythmia to sinus rhythm and (2) chronic treatment to prevent recurrence. DC (direct current) cardioversion (also known as defibrillation) is often used to convert an arrhythmia to sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) given intravenously are often effective for conversion but are more commonly used for chronic treatment to maintain sinus rhythm and prevent recurrence of arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic drugs are divided into four classes based on their primary molecular site of action: In the next section, we will divide the antiarrhythmic drugs by rhythm control and rate control. RHYTHYM CONTROL I.Sodium Channel Blockers II.alpha-Adrenergic Antagonists III.Potassium Channel Blockers IV.Calcium Channel Blockers This section focuses on Class I and III AADs (antiarrhythmic drugs), which alter action potential generation in atria and ventricles and are primarily used for rhythm control. CLAss I AADs: SODIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS Basic Mechanism of Action Class I AADs block sodium channels that are responsible for the rising phase (Phase 0) of the cardiac action potential. It is surprising cardiac sodium channel blockers can be used safely for treatment of arrhythmias without blocking action potential generation and causing cardiac arrest. How is it possible to treat arrhythmias with Class I AADs safely? Two key aspects of sodium channel block are important for the safe and effective use of Class I AADs: 1. Blockage is frequency-dependent. Cells that fire action potentials at a high rate are inhibited more effectively than cells that fire at sinus rhythm. Class I AADs bind to a receptor in the lumen of the pore of the sodium channel (Figure 10-6). They can reach this receptor site faster when the pore is open. If the pore is frequently 6  10 \\nopened by action potential firing at high rates, drug binding is enhanced because the drug binding site is available more often for binding. Hence, sodium channels in rapidly firing cells are more effectively inhibited by AADs. 2. Blockage is voltage-dependent. Cells that are depolarized due to damage or change in ion gradients are inhibited more effectively than cells with normal metabolism and function. Voltage-dependent block of sodium channels results primarily from drug binding to the inactivated state of sodium channels. When cells are depolarized (often due to injury, infarct or drugs), sodium channels enter the inactivated state more often and remain in the inactivated state longer. Therefore, drug binding is increased, resulting in more complete inhibition of channels. Different Class I AADs vary in their affinity for each of the different functional states of sodium channels (Closed, Open, Inactivated). Figure 10-6: Local Anesthetic/Antiarrhythmic Receptor Site in the Pore of the Sodium Channel. Left. A molecular model for binding of lidocaine (yellow) bound in the pore of a human sodium channel. Center and Right. The three-dimensional structure of a bacterial ancestor of human sodium channels with the amino acid side chains that form the drug receptor site highlighted in color. Primary Effects of Class I AADs on the Cardiac Action Potential 1. Increased Threshold. The threshold for firing an action potential is less negative, so a stronger depolarizing stimulus is required for action potential generation. 2. Reduced Vmax. Vmax is the rate of rise of the action potential in mV/msec. The rate of movement of the action potential (conduction) through cardiac tissue is proportional to the rate of rise of the action potential in cardiac myocytes (Vmax). (Figure 10-7) 3. Increased Effective Refractory Period. Effective Refractory Period (ERP) is the time in msec from the beginning of the cardiac action potential to the time when the cell has repolarized sufficiently that enough sodium channels have recovered from inactivation to generate and conduct a new action potential.  10 7 \\n Figure 10-7: Effect of Class I AADs on the Cardiac Action Potential Subclassification of the Class I Antiarrhythmic Drugs The Class I antiarrhythmic drugs have distinct effects on the action potential in cardiac cells. These different effects correlate with differences in their therapeutic efficacy. Class IA: Reduction in repetitive firing by increased threshold and frequency- dependent block. Reduced Vmax. Prolonged ARP and ERP.Binding and unbinding are intermediate in rate. Class IB: Reduction in repetitive firing by increased threshold and frequency- dependent block. Little effect on Vmax at therapeutic concentrations. Binding and unbinding are rapid. Class IC: Reduction in repetitive firing by increased threshold and frequency- dependent block. Larger reduction in Vmax than Class IA AADs but little effect on ERP.Binding and unbinding are slow. Common Sodium Channel-Related Toxicity of Class I AADs All Class I AADs have the possibility of dose-related toxicity caused by too much inhibition of sodium channels. Reduced Vmax caused by treatment with Class I AADs can cause slowed conduction and generation of arrhythmic action potentials. The therapeutic index of most Class I AADs is low requiring dose adjustment and 8  10 \\nclose monitoring of patient response. ECG is used to monitor changes in cardiac rhythms and Vmax. Widening of the QRS complex by greater than 50% of pre- drug width indicates toxicity. Because toxicity can lead to ventricular arrhythmia, it is essential to determine whether an arrhythmia is caused by drug overdose or underdose. The treatment decision to increase or decrease the dose level is made by monitoring ECG and plasma drug levels. Sodium channel-related toxicity of Class I AADs depends on drug class: Class IC > Class IA > Class IB Sodium channel-related toxicity correlates with reduced Vmax and slow drug binding and unbinding. Class IA Antiarrhythmic Drugs Procainamide Procainamide increases threshold, reduces repetitive firing, reduces Vmax, and increases ERP.Figure 10-8: Molecular Structure of Procainamide Therapeutic Uses of Procainamide Broad spectrum AAD.Procainamide is used in chronic oral therapy for atrial flutter, fibrillation, and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. It is also used for acute treatment via IV injection of atrial flutter and fibrillation and for ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Procainamide is no longer available in tablet form in the U.S.Off-Target Toxicity of Procainamide Hypotension upon injection of high doses. Dose-related nausea in chronic oral therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions are common and often severe in chronic therapy. Agranulocytosis in early weeks of therapy. Of greatest concern is development of a Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE)-like syndrome among patients receiving procainamide chronically: up to 70% of patients develop anti-nuclear antibodies within one year; 20% to 30% develop SLE symptoms. Patients with SLE symptoms stop procainamide treatment. SLE-like syndrome is reversible upon drug withdrawal. This side effect is the primary reason for the removal of procainamide tablets from use in the U.S.Quinidine Quinidine is an alkaloid derived from cinchona bark. Its enantiomer, quinine, is used as an antimalarial. Quinidine is more effective than quinine as an AAD. 10 9 \\nQuinidine increases threshold, reduces repetitive firing, reduces Vmax, and increases ERP.Quinidine also has two important off-target pharmacological effects. Atropine-like antimuscarinic activity accelerates conduction through the AV node, which can increase ventricular rate in the context of atrial tachycardia. Digoxin is sometimes co-administered to prevent this effect. Block of potassium channels lengthens action potential duration. This may have therapeutic benefit. Oral quinidine gluconate reaches peak concentrations in 3 to 4 hrs. The half-life is 6-7 hr. Quinidine is not administered parenterally because of severe hypotension. Therapeutic Uses of Quinidine Broad spectrum AAD.However, quinidine is a classic drug, now used rarely in the U.S.Quinidine is used as chronic oral therapy to prevent atrial flutter, fibrillation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Quinidine is also used in chronic oral therapy to prevent ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Off-Target Toxicity of Quinidine Diarrhea occurs in 30-50% of patients. Cinchonism also occurs, including headache and tinnitus. Disopyramide Disopyramide has pharmacological effects similar to quinidine, including prominent antimuscarinic actions. It is used for maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter or fibrillation and for preventing recurrence of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Class IB Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine Lidocaine increases threshold and reduces repetitive firing but has little effect on Vmax or ERP at therapeutic levels. Lidocaine is well absorbed but extensively metabolized by amidases on first pass through the liver. Therefore, lidocaine is given by IV injection or infusion. It has a short (2 hr.) half-life and multicompartmental disposition. A loading dose is used to establish an effective plasma level quickly. 10 Figure 10-9: Molecular Structure of Lidocaine  10 \\nTherapeutic Uses of Lidocaine Lidocaine is a fast-acting local anesthetic that is clinically useful for acute intravenous control of ventricular arrhythmias. Its use is restricted to IV administration in urgent care settings. Lidocaine is used to convert ventricular arrhythmias to sinus rhythm and to control ventricular arrhythmias during cardiac surgery and after myocardial infarction. Its rapid rate of action and clearance together with ECG monitoring allow minute-to-minute titration and control of ventricular rhythms. Lidocaine is not used for control of endogenous atrial arrhythmias. Lidocaine can be used to control digitalis-induced arrhythmias in both atria and ventricles. Toxicity of Lidocaine Compared to other AADs, lidocaine has a relatively high therapeutic index, so occurrences of toxicity are rare. High plasma levels cause CNS symptoms characteristic of local anesthetic overdose: drowsiness, increased irritability, and occasionally convulsions. Tocainide and Mexiletine: Stable lidocaine analogs The beneficial effects of lidocaine on ventricular arrhythmias and its relatively high therapeutic index have been captured in two oral drugs, tocainide and mexiletine. They are close chemical analogs that lack the amide linkage that is rapidly metabolized in lidocaine. These drugs have similar pharmacological actions to lidocaine. However, they are useful via oral administration because their serum half-life is l0 to l5 hr. Mexiletine is more commonly used clinically. Class IC Antiarrhythmic Drugs Flecainide Flecainide increases threshold and reduces repetitive firing. It reduces Vmax more than Class IA drugs but has little effect on ERP.It is a potent sodium channel blocker with a slow off rate. Flecainide is well absorbed after an oral dose. Half-life is 10 to 20 hr. It is excreted unchanged and metabolized in liver. Figure 10-10: Molecular Structure of Flecainide Therapeutic Uses of Flecainide Flecainide is used in treatment of atrial arrhythmias only, including atrial tachycardia and fibrillation. Toxicity of Flecainide Flecainide has serious cardiac toxicity due to sodium channel block. The CAST trial showed increased incidence of fatal ventricular arrhythmia with chronic use in patients with previous history of myocardial infarctions. Therefore, flecainide is  10 11 \\nused only in patients with normal ventricular function and no history of myocardial infarction. Propafenone Like flecainide, propafenone increases threshold and reduces repetitive firing. It reduces Vmax more than Class IA drugs but has little effect on ERP.It is a potent sodium channel blocker with slow off rate. Propafenone is well absorbed from oral dose. Half-life 10-20 hr. Metabolized in liver by P450 2D6, which varies among individuals. Can lead to variable half-life and adverse effects in poor metabolizers. Similar to flecainide, propafenone is only used for treatment of atrial arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, in patients with normal ventricular function. CLAss III AADs: POTAssIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS The Class III antiarrhythmics are a diverse group of drugs that have 3 common effects: K+ channel blockade, delayed repolarization, and prolonged action potential duration and ERP.Figure 10-11: Effect of Class III AADs on the Cardiac Action Potential Amiodarone: A Class III / Class I Hybrid Amiodarone blocks both K+ and Na+ channels. Blockade of K+ channels is more potent, but both effects contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy. Figure 10-12: Molecular Structure of Amiodarone  10 12 \\nCardiac effects include prolongation of action potential duration, increased ERP, and reduced Vmax and conduction velocity at high doses. Amiodarone is highly lipophilic and has problematic pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. It accumulates greater than 20:1 in tissues, mostly in lipid depots. It is absorbed and eliminated slowly. Loading doses are used because several weeks are required to reach steady state plasma level at a constant dose. Half-life varies from 26 to >100 days, average about 50 days. Therapeutic Uses of Amiodarone IV treatment can be used for conversion to sinus rhythm. Oral therapy is effective against both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias. Low doses can often control supraventricular arrhythmias. Amiodarone is increasingly used for chronic treatment of patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias despite its off-target side effects. Clinical trials indicate that amiodarone does not increase mortality of chronically treated patients, in contrast to Class IC sodium channel blockers. Toxicity of Amiodarone Amiodarone has relatively rare cardiovascular toxic effects, including hypotension and depressed beating rate. Extra-cardiac toxicity is much more common and severe. Some adverse effects of long-term therapy result from tissue accumulation. These include corneal and liver microdeposits, thyroid and liver dysfunction, and photosensitivity of the skin. The most severe side effect is pulmonary fibrosis, a potentially fatal condition. It is rare at low doses used to treat atrial arrhythmias. Pulmonary fibrosis requires withdrawal from amiodarone therapy. Symptoms reverse on withdrawal from drug. Adverse neurologic effects are common: headache, paresthesias. Drug interactions are very common, especially with other lipophilic drugs: warfarin, theophylline, quinidine, procainamide, flecainide, and others. Amiodarone increases circulating concentrations of these drugs by release from lipid depots and these drugs can cause increased levels of amiodarone. Dronedarone Dronedarone is a chemical derivative of amiodarone without the iodine moieties. It blocks both K+ channels and Na+ channels like amiodarone. tremor, ataxia, and Figure 10-13: Molecular Structure of Dronedarone  10 13 \\nTherapeutic Uses of Dronedarone Dronedarone is used for atrial tachycardia and fibrillation and for ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not as effective as amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias. Toxicity of Dronedarone Much lower incidence of toxic side effects than amiodarone. Dofetilide Dofetilide is a potent blocker of one specific K+ channel (KV11.1 or hERG: human ether-a-go-go-related gene) that is responsible for the early phase of action potential repolarization via the IKr current. Dofetilide prolongs action potential duration and ERP.Figure 10-14: Molecular Structure of Dofetilide Dofetilide is used to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial flutter and fibrillation. Frequent toxicity (1% to 3%) due to drug-induced long QT syndrome and increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Must be monitored carefully by ECG.Safe in patients with impaired ventricular function. Ibutilide Similar to dofetilide, but administered by IV only because of rapid action and rapid metabolism during first pass through the liver. Used for conversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation to sinus rhythm. Causes prolonged QT interval in 6% of patients, but this is easily recognized in an urgent care setting. Sotalol In addition to prolonging action potential duration by blocking K+ channels, Sotalol has alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist activity. l-sotalol is much greater than d- sotalol as a alpha-adrenergic antagonist; l-sotalol is equivalent to d-sotalol as a K+ channel blocker. Only racemic sotalol is used in therapy because d-sotalol is proarrhythmic. Sotalol prolongs action potential duration and ERP of His-Purkinje system and ventricular muscle because block of K+ channels delays repolarization. Pacemaker activity in SA node and conduction velocity in AV node are decreased. Therapeutic Uses of Sotalol Sotalol is used to treat ventricular and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, especially paroxysmal and re-entrant or accessory pathway AV nodal arrhythmias. Only the racemic d,l mixture is used. d isomer is pro-arrhythmic. Low dose gives primarily alpha-adrenergic blockade. Higher doses also give K+ channel blockade. 14  10 \\nToxicity of Sotalol Sotalol can be arrhythmogenic due to too much K+ channel blockade and too much slowing of repolarization. It causes after-depolarizations, prolonged ventricular action potential (ie drug-induced long QT syndrome), and ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is seen in up to 15% of patients at high doses. RATE CONTROL This section focuses on Class II and IV AADs, which primarily affect action potential generation in the SA and AV nodes and therefore are primarily used for rate control. Class II AADs: beta-ANTAGONISTS In the heart, beta-adrenergic antagonists block sympathetic stimulation, reduce the production of cAMP in the SA and AV nodes, and thereby reduce activation of calcium channels and HCN channels (ie funny channels) during Phase 4 diastolic depolarization and Vmax of the action potential in SA and AV nodal cells (Figure 10-15). These effects reduce overall heart rate. They also reduce the rate of impulse propagation through the AV node, thereby reducing ventricular rate in the context of atrial tachycardia or fibrillation. Slowed conduction and increased ERP in the AV node are important elements in the antiarrhythmic actions of alpha-adrenergic antagonists. Figure 10-15: Effect of sympathetic stimulation in the AV node. alpha-blockers are primarily used to treat supraventricular arrhythmias. One objective of treatment in these arrhythmias is to slow the ventricular rate to allow more effective pumping in addition to converting to sinus rhythm and preventing recurrence. The increase in AV nodal ERP is useful in this regard.  10 15 \\nMetoprolol is a alpha1-selective antagonist. These drugs are used for both urgent treatment by IV and for chronic treatment orally. Propranolol and carvedilol are nonselective among beta-adrenergic receptor types. Esmolol is a alpha1-selective antagonist with a very short half-life (~8 min) used in urgent care settings. Other Drugs That Antagonize Sympathetic Stimulation of the Heart Ivabradine: The first HCN (If) blocker A first-in-class pharmacological agent. Reduces heart rate by inhibiting HCN channels (ie funny channels) in the SA node. Reduces slope of diastolic depolarization. This medication does not reduce ventricular contractility, unlike beta- blockers. Ivabradine is useful in inappropriate sinus tachycardia and in angina pectoris. It is also useful in heart failure as reducing heart rate reduces the workload of the heart. Available for oral therapy with twice daily dosing Adenosine: Acute conversion of atrial tachycardia Adenosine is a local physiological modulator in the vasculature that antagonizes sympathetic stimulation of the heart through action on its own G protein-coupled Adenosine Receptors. Receptor activation releases G protein alpha\\uf067 subunits that in turn increase activation of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir) in the atria and AV node. Activation of Kir hyperpolarizes AV nodal cells and stops atrial arrhythmias that involve re-entry from the AV node. Pharmacokinetics Rapid onset. Rapid reversal by active uptake into cells in seconds. Effective dosing requires a rapidly administered bolus. Therapeutic Uses Acute conversion of re-entrant supraventricular tachycardias. Adenosine blocks impulse reentry is contraindicated for atrial fibrillation. Adenosine is occasionally used for conversion of ventricular tachycardia resulting from after-depolarizations, by blocking alpha-adrenergic driven after-depolarizations. CLAss IV AADs: Ca2+ CHANNEL BLOCKERS the AV node. Adenosine from is not effective and There are three structural classes of calcium channel blockers currently in therapeutic use: 1. Dihydropyridines: nifedipine, isradipine, amlodipine, others. 2. Benzothiazepines: diltiazem. 3. Phenylalkylamines: verapamil, others. 16  10 \\nFigure 10-16: Molecular Structure of Calcium Channel Blockers Each of these drug types binds to the Ca2+ channel at a distinct receptor site. The three types of Ca2+channel blockers have distinct therapeutic uses, which correlate with their different levels of voltage dependence and frequency dependence. Frequency dependence: verapamil > diltiazem >> nifedipine Voltage dependence: nifedipine > diltiazem = verapamil Verapamil is used most extensively as an antiarrhythmic drug, probably because it has the strongest frequency dependence among these different drugs. Diltiazem, which also has frequency-dependent actions, is used for arrhythmias. Nifedipine and other dihydropyridines are not used for arrhythmias. Table 10-1: Indications for Calcium Channel Blockers Verapamil Verapamil is the most commonly used phenylalkylamine Ca2+ channel blocker. At therapeutic concentrations, verapamil has little effect on Vmax in atria and ventricles but shortens the plateau in phase 2 of the action potential. Phase 4 diastolic depolarization and Vmax are slowed in SA and AV nodes where the Ca2+ current is an important determinant of Vmax. AV nodal conduction velocity is reduced, which is an important therapeutic effect (Figure 10-17). Therapeutic use Verapamil is used in treatment of atrial arrhythmias. The slowing of AV nodal conduction prevents re-entrant impulses from conduction system from re-exciting  10 17 \\nthe atria and producing paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are counteracted by block of slowly conducted calcium-dependent responses and the conduction of the rapid atrial rate to the ventricles is reduced by the prolongation of the AV nodal conduction time. Verapamil is more effective by IV than by oral administration. Greater than 90% is adsorbed after oral administration, though there is substantial first pass metabolism. The elimination half-time is 3-7 hours. Toxic effects Verapamil can cause severe hypotension in patients taking other vasodilators or alpha-blockers. Verapamil should not be given to patients with slowed or blocked AV conduction or to patients with compromised ventricular performance due to acute heart failure. Diltiazem Uses and actions of diltiazem on atrial arrhythmias are similar to verapamil.

Intravenous medications such as isoproterenol and dopamine can transiently increase the sinus rate and sometimes facilitate improved AV node conduction; however, there are no oral equivalents. Symptomatic patients often require pacemaker implantation (discussed below). Sick Sinus Syndrome (ssS, a.k.a. sinus node dysfunction) is the most common reason for pacemaker implantation in the United States. The incidence of ssS increases with age and can be seen with long standing hypertension and coronary artery disease. AV Block may be either congenital or acquired. The incidence of congenital complete heart block is one out of every 20,000 births and may be associated with maternal lupus and maternal antibodies to Ro and La (ss-A and ss-B, respectively). Acquired AV block most commonly occurs as a result of fibrosis and degeneration of the conduction system disease. Common and rare causes of advanced AV block are listed in Table 10-3. 20 Table 10-3: Common and Rare Causes of AV Block  10 \\nTachyarrhythmias Tachyarrhythmias can be divided into supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The SVTs (supraventricular tachyarrhythmias) are further divided into regular and irregular (Figure 10-18). A 12 lead ECG is usually sufficient to make a firm diagnosis, but further diagnostic maneuvers may be needed. Presentations vary from some patients being asymptomatic, to others with palpitations, syncope or even sudden cardiac arrest. Figure 10-18: Categorization of Tachyarrhythmias Sinus Tachycardia Generally does not require specific treatment. Therapy should be directed toward the underlying cause (e.g., sepsis, hypovolemia, hyperthyroidism, fever). Inappropriate sinus tachycardia in otherwise healthy patients is rare. Generally seen in young women, associated with fatigue, dizziness, palpitations and exercise intolerance. First line therapy is beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Ivabradine, a selective sinus node If channel blocker has been shown to improve symptoms in many patients. Atrial Tachycardia Can be seen in normal hearts as well as in patients with structural heart disease, such as valve disease, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, and pulmonary disease. Often paroxysmal but can be persistent. Often seen along with atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Mainstay of therapy is similarly beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Those failing medications or wishing to forgo chronic medications may be candidates for ablation (discussed below). AVNRT - AV node reentry tachycardia AVNRT is the most common cause of regular supraventricular tachycardia in the general population. It can occur throughout the age spectrum, but often presents in 20s and 30s. Patients present with abrupt palpitations, sensation of neck fullness (due to atrial contraction against the closed tricuspid valve), shortness of breath  10 21 \\nand dizziness. Acute treatment aims to promote transient block in the AV node. This can often be achieved with vagal maneuvers such as Valsalva. IV Adenosine is > 90% effective. Chronic therapy can involve beta blockers or calcium channel blockers, but many patients opt for curative catheter ablation therapy in order to avoid the need for daily medications. Atrial Flutter This is a very common arrhythmia seen generally in patients older than 60 years. Risk factors are hypertension, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathy, prior heart surgery and pulmonary disease. Typical flutter is a counterclockwise reentrant conduction around the tricuspid valve, with an atrial rate of ~300 bpm. Patients often present with 2:1 AV conduction, and therefore, a ventricular rate of ~150 bpm. Flutter can be difficult to rate control, even with high dose beta blockers and calcium channel blockers. Acute conversion with intravenous ibutilide is effective in about 75% of patients. Amiodarone, sotalol and dofetilide can be used with modest efficacy for acute conversion but are generally used for chronic rhythm control. Ablation is very effective for long term control of typical flutter, with > 95% success. Patients who have flutter, even if they undergo ablation, remain at risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Atrial Fibrillation Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. It will affect 1 in 4 adults over the age of 40 over their lifespan. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, mainly via a dramatic increase in the risk of stroke. Ineffective atrial contraction during AF leads to stasis of blood in the left atrial appendage, which can lead to thrombus formation and ultimately embolism. Patients with AF can be asymptomatic or present with palpitations, fatigue, exercise intolerance, atypical chest pain, dizziness, and rarely syncope or stroke. AF is categorized by duration and context: Paroxysmal AF: Episodes spontaneously terminate within 7 days of onset, often within minutes to hours. Persistent AF: Episodes require cardioversion or last longer than one week. Permanent or Chronic AF: Either therapy has not been effective or the patient and treating physician have elected to allow AF to continue, generally for > 1 year. Lone AF: Used to describe AF in a patient < 60 years old, with a structurally normal heart (on echocardiogram) and no other cardiovascular disease, including HTN and diabetes. This is a somewhat imprecise term, used variably. These patients have a lower thrombotic risk (see below) but can be very symptomatic. The approach to AF management can be summarized by the 4Cs: Cause: Search for underlying causes such as hyperthyroidism, acute heart failure, or valvular disease. All patients should have a TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) lab test and an echocardiogram. Clot: Each patient needs to have risk stratification for stroke, and anticoagulation when appropriate (see CHA2DS2-VASc score below). 22  10 \\n  Control: Rate control should be assessed, and beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers used to a goal heart rate in AF of ~ 80bpm resting and <120 bpm with mild-moderate exercise. Cure: Consideration of rhythm control with antiarrhythmic drugs for symptomatic patients or catheter ablation for those patients who have failed a trial of drug therapy. the class IC agents are Many patients with AF can be managed with anticoagulation and rate control only. Symptomatic patients may require antiarrhythmic therapy. Amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide and the most commonly prescribed antiarrhythmics for AF.All have potential side effects and need to be monitored. For patients with recurrent symptomatic AF, catheter ablation can be one option (described below). The CHA2DS2-VASc score (Table 10-4) is used to risk stratify patients with AF in order to choose appropriate levels of anticoagulation. Patients with a score of 0 are recommended to take aspirin, if anything. Those with a score of 1 can take aspirin or full anticoagulation (with warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant agent such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran or apixaban). Those with a score of 2 or higher should be on full dose anticoagulation. This is balanced against the risk of bleeding in an individual patient. Table 10-4: Risk Score for Atrial Fibrillation Ventricular tachycardia (VT) This rhythm is usually seen in patients with structural heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy or valvular disease, but can also be seen in normal hearts. Patients may present with sustained VT, non-sustained VT, syncope, palpitations or even cardiac arrest. Antiarrhythmics are often insufficient protection against recurrence, and a defibrillator is indicated in patients with VT and concurrent structural heart disease.  10 23 \\nCARDIAC RHYTHM DEVICES Pacemakers Pacemakers have been around for over a half a century and continue to evolve, mainly with improved battery longevity and increased software functionality. However, the concept behind a pacemaker remains the same - delivering an electric stimulus directly to the myocardium to initiate an action potential in the absence of a spontaneous depolarization. Pacemakers are generally only implanted in symptomatic patients with the exception of complete heart block. Pacemakers terminate or \"rate control\" tachyarrhythmias. However, the presence of a pacemaker may allow a patient to tolerate more rate controlling agents, such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers without developing symptomatic bradycardia (for example, in a case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation). Defibrillators treat bradycardias; they cannot Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted devices capable of both pacing as well as cardioversion or defibrillation. ICDs are implanted in patients who have sustained a cardiac arrest thought to be due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia (secondary prevention) or who are deemed to be at high risk of having a life- threatening VT or VF (ventricular fibrillation) event (primary prevention). The ICD is programmed to detect an arrhythmia above a certain rate threshold as VT or VF and usually to deliver a rapid pacing sequence called anti-tachycardia pacing or ATP followed by a shock if the ATP is unsuccessful. Multiple landmark trials including MADIT, MADIT-II, and SCD-Heft have demonstrated a survival benefit for an ICD in patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, generally with a left ventricular ejection fraction <35% after optimal medical therapy. 24 Figure 10-19: Left sided, dual chamber defibrillator (atrial pacing lead and RV defibrillator lead)  10 \\nImplantable Loop Recorders These subcutaneous devices can record arrhythmias in response to pre-specified thresholds or the patient may initiate a recording via an activator button. Just like pacemakers and ICDs, data is \"interrogated\" from the device via a brand specific computer and can be printed or stored electronically for later review. These are most commonly used to investigate unexplained syncope or in the case of cryptogenic stroke, for atrial fibrillation surveillance. Electrophysiology Study and Catheter Ablation Patients with arrhythmias may be candidates for curative catheter ablation. During an ablation, electrophysiology catheters with electrodes on the end are advanced through veins and/or arteries back into the heart. Most of the time, the common femoral vein or artery is used. Generally, a combination of fluoroscopy and a 3D electroanatomic mapping system are used in order to visualize the catheters within the cardiac chambers. Depending upon the target of ablation, multiple electrical catheters may be used as well intracardiac ultrasound. Intracardiac electrical signals are recorded from within the heart and displayed along with the surface ECG leads. HRA HRA RV CS His ABL RV His ABL CS A B Figure 10-20: Catheter Ablation. Panel A: Right anterior oblique fluoroscopic image showing catheters for an AVNRT ablation; Panel B: Left anterior oblique view Cure rates vary by arrhythmia but are generally >95-97% for AVRT (WPW), AVNRT or typical flutter; 70% for atrial fibrillation; and >90% in idiopathic VT.VT ablation in structural heart disease (ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy) carries a lower acute and chronic success rate due to the underlying substrate. Ablation may be considered palliative rather than curative in many of these patients.  10 25 \\n 26  10 \\nChapter 11 Shock Author: Patricia Kritek, MD, EdM INTRODUCTION Shock is a state of decreased tissue perfusion that can result in organ dysfunction if severe or prolonged. The initial step in the treatment of shock is to identify the type of shock and its etiology. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Define shock and its clinical manifestations Delineate the different types of shock and the clinical circumstances in which they may occur Diagnose shock and determine when additional non-invasive or invasive testing may be needed Delineate normal hemodynamics as obtained by right heart catheterization and compare those to the characteristic changes seen in different types of shock Prioritize the treatment options for the various types of shock DEFINITION Shock: Failure of the circulatory system to maintain adequate tissue perfusion resulting in inadequate delivery of oxygen to cells. Early signs and symptoms of shock are manifestations of inadequate perfusion and tissue hypoxia. Patients may initially be light-headed or dizzy with progression to confusion due to decreased delivery of oxygen to the brain. Urine output often decreases. In many cases, patients become tachycardic. Most patients with shock will have a fall in blood pressure (i.e., hypotension) although this is not always the case. Elevated lactate levels are often an early finding in patients with shock, as cells transition from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism due to the inadequate delivery of oxygen. Despite these physical exam findings, shock can be difficult to recognize. The most important step in evaluation is to identify that a patient is \"in shock.\" Stating that the patient is \"in shock\" is a recognition of severe, life threatening physiologic derangement, but is not unto itself a specific diagnosis. Shock may result from multiple etiologies and it is important to identify the most likely etiology and treat accordingly; thus while shock is an important recognition, \"septic shock\" is a specific diagnosis that has specific treatments. In many cases, treatment modalities overlap (e.g., vasopressors may be useful for treatment of many types of shock). On the other hand, some therapies are used only to certain types of shock (eg intraaortic balloon pumps are only used to treat cardiogenic shock). Since shock is a failure of the circulatory system to supply blood and nutrients to tissues, the primary defect lies in either the pump or the vasculature. An approach to evaluating shock is outlined below.  11 1 \\nETIOLOGIES OF SHOCK Broadly, shock can be categorized into three main categories: hypovolemic, distributive and cardiogenic. The first step in the evaluation of a patient in shock is to try to determine which of these etiologies predominates. To do this, we use a combination of history, physical examination, and other studies. At times, invasive monitoring is used to distinguish between causes of shock (discussed later) but this is the exception and not the rule. Hypovolemic Shock Hypovolemic shock is caused by decreased circulating volume. By far the most common cause of hypovolemic shock is hemorrhage due to trauma, surgery, or other disease (e.g., gastrointestinal bleeding from an ulcer). Less commonly, hypovolemia results from massive diarrhea and vomiting, extensive third-space redistribution of fluids, or severe burns. Many times, it becomes clear with just a history that the patient\\'s shock is hypovolemic in origin. Physical exam findings which suggest hypovolemia include tachycardia (in an effort to increase cardiac output with low stroke volume from an underfilled heart), low jugular venous pressure and cool extremities due to peripheral vasoconstriction. The mainstay of treatment of hypovolemic shock is restoration of circulating volume. The first step is almost always administration of intravenous fluids (e.g., normal saline or lactated ringers) and can be followed by transfusion of blood products if the cause of hypovolemia is hemorrhage. Volume is given quickly, through short, to rapid volume resuscitation is treatment of the underlying cause of loss of blood or other fluids. Interventions may include surgery, endoscopy or embolization of bleeding vessels if a patient is bleeding. Treatments to reduce diarrhea or vomiting are useful when gastrointestinal losses are the source of hypovolemia. Distributive shock large bore catheters. Equally important Distributive shock results from dilation of the peripheral vasculature resulting in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. With this dilation, the effective circulating volume falls. With many causes of distributive shock, capillaries also become leaky resulting in further decreases in intravascular volume. The most common cause of distributive shock is sepsis: a dysregulated host response to infection resulting in organ dysfunction. Anaphylaxis, spinal cord injury, adrenal insufficiency, and some other rarer conditions can also cause distributive shock. Once again, the patient\\'s history often points towards the diagnosis of distributive shock. Has the patient been febrile? Are there signs and symptoms of pneumonia or a urinary tract infection or appendicitis? Was the patient just stung by a bee or did she receive a new medication? By taking a comprehensive history, the physician is often directed to the etiology of shock. Patients presenting with distributive shock will often be tachycardic and hypotensive, but in contrast to patients with hypovolemia, they will have warm extremities consistent with underlying vasodilation. Most patients with septic shock will be febrile. Examination should focus on signs of a potential infection (e.g., right upper quadrant pain to suggest gallbladder disease or focal crackles on pulmonary exam consistent with a pneumonia). In patients with concern for 2 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 11 \\nseptic shock, white blood cell count and cultures (e.g., blood, urine, sputum) should be obtained. The initial step in treatment of distributive shock is often the administration of intravenous fluids to replete the effective circulating volume. However, in contrast to hypovolemic shock, most patients will require additional blood pressure support with vasopressors (Table 11-1). The most commonly used vasopressors for septic shock include norepinephrine and vasopressin. Anaphylaxis is treated with epinephrine. For all patients in whom septic shock is considered, early and appropriate antibiotic administration is essential. Delayed antibiotic dosing is associated with increased mortality in this population. Cardiogenic Shock Cardiogenic shock is caused by inadequate cardiac output. This can be the result of a variety of insults to the heart including: 1. Impaired contractility (e.g., large anterior wall myocardial infarction) 2. Abnormal heart rhythm (e.g., ventricular fibrillation) 3. Valvular pathology (e.g., acute mitral regurgitation) 4. Obstruction to filling (e.g., pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade) Patients who develop cardiogenic shock have cool extremities as a result of peripheral vasoconstriction. This is the body\\'s response to low forward flow in an attempt to maintain perfusion to the central core organs. Many patients with cardiogenic shock will have elevated jugular venous pressure resulting from increased filling pressures of both the left and right sides of the heart. Additional cardiac exam findings such as a loud systolic murmur, irregular heart rhythm or prominent third heart sound can help point towards an exact cause of cardiogenic shock. For most patients where there is a concern for cardiogenic shock, an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram are obtained as part of the initial evaluation. Many patients with cardiogenic shock will be supported with inotropic agents (Table 11-1) while others may require interventions (e.g., cardioversion) or mechanical support. A more thorough discussion of heart failure is found in Chapter 8. VASOPREssORS AND INOTROPES Vasoactive agents, inotropic medications, or a combination of the two are often needed to support patients in shock. Most patients with distributive shock will need a vasoconstrictor, or vasopressor, to maintain their blood pressure while patients with cardiogenic shock are often treated with inotropes. The following table is a guide to the different agents used, their physiologic effect and their most common clinical applications.  11 3 \\nTable 11-1: Adrenergic agents used in shock. alpha1, alpha1, and alpha2 refer to their respective adrenergic receptors. DA refers to dopaminergic receptor. INVASIVE HEMODYNAMIC MEASUREMENT For the vast majority of patients with shock, invasive hemodynamic monitoring is not required. The use of a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter is most useful in the management of patients with cardiogenic shock. However, the measurements attained by this device can also help differentiate between etiologies of shock. Placement of the PA catheter Placing a PA catheter, or right heart catheterization, is typically performed by advancing a balloon-tipped catheter under hemodynamic and/or fluoroscopic guidance from a venous access site (i.e., internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein) to the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary capillary wedge positions. Pressure is recorded from the catheter tip. By temporarily inflating the balloon, which sits just proximal to the end of the catheter, in the pulmonary artery, the catheter tip becomes stuck or \"wedged,\" thereby occluding a small branch of the pulmonary artery. The catheter tip is now shielded from pressure in the pulmonary artery and because there is no forward blood flow, pressure equilibrates distally across the capillary bed and the recorded pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is therefore an indirect measurement of left atrial pressure. from cardiac positions are demonstrated below. For normal values, refer to Table 11-2. Typical pressure tracings 4 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 11 \\nParameter Right atrial pressure (RAP) Normal Range 2-8 mm Hg Right ventricular pressure (RVP) 15-30 / 2-8 mm Hg Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) 15-30 / 4-12 mm Hg (mean 16 mm Hg) Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) 6-15 mm Hg Cardiac Output (CO) 5 L/min Table 11-2: Normal PA catheter measurements. Waveforms Figure 11-1: PA Catheter path and waveforms.  11 5 \\nCardiac Output Cardiac output (liters/min) is equal to the stroke volume (ml) multiplied by the heart rate (beats/min). Normal resting cardiac output is approximately 5 liters/min. The PA catheter allows estimation of the cardiac output in two different ways. Thermodilution Most PA catheters contain a thermister at the distal tip that allows for temperature measurement. Thermodilution cardiac output is performed by injecting a volume of cold saline at a given temperature peripherally where it enters the right atrium through a proximal port in the catheter. The rate of temperature change measured at the catheter tip is an indirect assessment of cardiac output. The faster the temperature changes, the higher the cardiac output. Figure 11-2: Thermodilution curves. The plot shows the absolute value of the temperature drop from normal (y-axis) over time (x-axis) following a bolus of cold injectate. Cardiac output is inversely proportional to the area under the thermodilution curve. With a large cardiac output, the bolus is pumped rapidly past the thermistor, so the area is small. Fick Equation A second way to estimate cardiac output is through assessment of the difference between arterial oxygen content and venous oxygen content. Oxygen content is determined by how much oxygen is bound to hemoglobin in the blood (oxygen saturation) and how much oxygen is dissolved in the blood. Arterial oxygen saturation can be determined from an arterial blood gas. Venous oxygen saturation, referred to as \"mixed venous saturation\" and abbreviated SvO2 , requires a PA catheter and is measured at the catheter tip in the pulmonary artery. The normal SvO2 is 75%. The calculation of oxygen content will be discussed further in the Pulmonary section of CPR.If the amount of oxygen being consumed by tissues (i.e., oxygen consumption) is known or has been estimated, cardiac output can be calculated based on the difference between arterial and venous oxygen contents. Patients with low cardiac output will have slower transient time through tissues, greater oxygen extraction and lower venous oxygen content. Thus, those patients with larger 6 CPR-Cardiovascular -Chapter 11 \\ndifferences between arterial and venous oxygen contents have lower cardiac output. This can be represented by the equation: CO = V O2 CaO2 - CvO2 where: CaO2 = arterial oxygen content CvO2 = venous oxygen content V̇ O2 = oxygen consumption. Systemic Vascular Resistance With the pressures measured by the PA catheter and the estimated cardiac output, system venous resistance (SVR) can be calculated. SVR = x 80 MAP - RAP CO Normal SVR is 800-1200 dynes x sec x cm-5 Estimations of filling pressures, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance can help in determining the etiology of a patient\\'s shock. Certain patterns are consistent with the three main types of shock. CLINICAL SCENARIOS The following scenarios illustrate classic clinical pictures of different types of shock. It is important to note that the PA catheter data is included to illustrate the different hemodynamic patterns of shock. Clinically, most of these patients would not have a PA catheter placed. Cardiogenic shock A 65 year-old presents to the emergency department with 4 hours of substernal chest pressure and dyspnea. Their blood pressure is 85/60 mm Hg and heart rate is 124 beats per minute.

KEY POINTS vasopressors (eg norepinephrine, Shock is a physiologic state of inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues. It is life threatening and may present in different ways. It does not imply a specific diagnosis. Determining the type of shock and underlying etiology are crucial in effective management. History and physical examination will provide substantial information to guide assessment and management. Pulmonary artery catheters may be useful in some patients but are not used in most patients with shock. References: 1. Figure 11-1 was adapted from Pathophysiology of Heart Disease. 6th ed.

However, valvular heart disease occurs in approximately 1-2% of the population. Heart murmurs can be an important early manifestation of valvular disease yet are also present in 20-40% of the population as a normal variant. At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Discuss the physiological consequences of valvular stenosis (narrowing) or regurgitation (leakage), including chambers affected and pressure versus volume overload. Discuss the symptoms and signs associated with types of valve dysfunction. Explain how changes in flow and systemic vascular resistance affect valve stenosis and regurgitation, respectively. Describe how to diagnose and quantify valve abnormalities. Discuss the indications and interventions for valve disease based on the valve involved and type of dysfunction. FUNCTION OF HEART VALVES Cardiac valves are one-way valves intended to prevent retrograde flow and permit forward flow. Thus, malfunction of a valve consists of allowing retrograde flow (regurgitation), impeding forward flow (stenosis), or both. ETIOLOGY OF VALVULAR HEART DISEASE Valvular disorders are generally divided into congenital and acquired. In this chapter, we will cover acquired valvular disorders. The congenital lesions will be discussed in Chapter 15, Congenital Heart Disease. Acquired valvular disease is most commonly of a degenerative, rheumatic, or infectious etiology. The valve affected, and the type of problem (ie stenosis vs regurgitation), is related to the cause. In the Euro Heart Study of patients referred to the hospital for management of valve disease, degenerative disease was most common (63%) followed by rheumatic disease (22%) (Figure 12-1). Degenerative valve disease is age related, but there are individual risk factors which may affect the probability of developing significant problems. Examples of this are calcific aortic stenosis, which is related to risk factors for atherosclerosis, and mitral valve myxomatous disease, which is often familial. There can also be mild valve abnormalities which increase the risk of developing problems. For example, the majority of calcific aortic stenosis occurs in patients after age 70. However, if the aortic valve is congenitally bicuspid rather than tricuspid, there is an increased incidence of a calcific aortic stenosis after age 50, even if the valve was not stenotic during early adulthood. Bicuspid valves are often associated with coarctation of the aorta (a congenital disease).  12 1 \\n Figure 12-1: Etiology of valve dysfunction in the Euro Heart Study. AS is aortic stenosis, AR is aortic regurgitation, MR is mitral regurgitation, and MS is mitral stenosis. Ref: Iung B et al. Eur Heart J 2003; 24:1231-43. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) primarily affects the mitral and aortic valves, and is a late complication of rheumatic fever, which in turn results from Group A streptococcal infections. It is a chronic inflammatory condition thought to be the result of similarities between group A strep antigens and cardiac proteins including myosin. Occasionally it will only affect the mitral valve, but usually the aortic valve is involved as well, although the severity may be much less. The incidence of rheumatic, or post-inflammatory valvular heart disease, has dramatically decreased in the United States over the past century. However, RHD remains a significant problem in low and middle-income countries with more than 300,000 premature deaths estimated to occur yearly. AORTIC STENOSIS (AS) If a valve impedes forward flow, it is termed stenotic. A stenotic valve leads to an increased pressure gradient across the valve. For example, in a patient with a normal aortic valve, there is a very small pressure gradient (a few mm Hg) during systole between the left ventricle (LV) and the aorta. However, in a patient with significant AS, there is a large systolic pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta (Figure 12-2). Also note that there is a delay in transmission of the pressure from the left ventricle to the aorta (delayed upstroke) and there is an increase in afterload of the left ventricle. We can report this pressure gradient in multiple ways. The \"peak instantaneous gradient,\" which is the largest pressure gradient between the LV and the aorta during systole. The \"peak to peak gradient,\" is the difference of peak pressure in the LV and the peak pressure in the aorta, even though they are measured at different times. The \"mean\" gradient during systole (average of the shaded area in Figure 12-2). 2  12 \\n Each of these gradients will give a different value. Although the values are correlated, the relation is not perfect. This is important because different diagnostic techniques measure some, but not all of these gradients. Fortunately, all techniques can measure a mean gradient, and thus, this is the most comparable value. AS is considered severe if the mean pressure gradient between the LV and aorta is >40 mm Hg, the peak instantaneous pressure gradient is >64 mm Hg, or the valve area is <1.0 cm2. Figure 12-2: Pressure tracings for Aortic Stenosis. In AS, a systolic pressure gradient (shaded area) is present between the left ventricle (LV) and aorta. Physiological and Clinical Consequences of AS We have now discussed one of the physiological consequences of a stenotic heart valve, which is an increased pressure gradient across the valve. This leads to a cascade of secondary physiological effects. Specifically, the increased resistance to outflow means there is an increase in LV systolic pressure, which causes increased wall stress. This leads to secondary hypertrophy (thickening of the LV walls) and increased myocardial oxygen demand. LV hypertrophy can lead to increased LV stiffness and impaired relaxation of the LV walls, also known as LV diastolic dysfunction. This in turn, causes increased LV filling pressure (ie an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure). If there is increased filling pressure, this leads to increased left atrial (LA) pressure and size, and a subsequent increase in pulmonary venous pressure.  12 3 \\nThese physiological effects have clinical consequences (Figure 12-3 and 12-4). For example, the increased myocardial oxygen demand may result in angina if there is inadequate oxygen supply, especially in setting of LV hypertrophy. During exercise, there is increased LV contractility leading to increased stroke volume and decreased LV afterload from arteriolar vasodilatation in skeletal muscle. However, in aortic stenosis, LV afterload does not decrease with exercise like it would normally because of the fixed narrow opening of the valve and conversely the pressure gradient increases with increased myocardial contractility. This results in a lower-than-normal increase in stroke volume and cardiac output with exercise. Combined with the normal fall in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) associated with skeletal muscle vasodilation, blood pressure falls. This combination of low cardiac output and decreased SVR can result in a patient presenting with exertional syncope or lightheadedness. Figure 12-3: Clinical consequences of the increased AV pressure gradient from aortic stenosis. LV hypertrophy results in increased wall stiffness and slowed ventricular relaxation during diastole. These changes can lead to increased LV end-diastolic pressure and LA filling pressure, resulting in LA enlargement. LA enlargement in turn increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. Finally, the increased LA filling pressure can lead to increased pulmonary venous pressure, resulting in pulmonary congestion or edema, and thus dyspnea on exertion, or even dyspnea at rest. The physical exam findings of AS are also related to its physiologic consequences. There is a systolic murmur that is harsh, heard best in the right second parasternal interspace (ie the aortic area, also known as the right upper sternal border), and has a crescendo-decrescendo sound, also known as an \"ejection\" or \"diamond- shaped\" murmur. The pulse may be delayed relative to the LV systole (tardus) and may be diminished in amplitude (parvus). This combination of a diminished and 4  12 \\n delayed pulse on exam is called pulsus parvus et tardus. Finally, increased stiffness of the left ventricle can result in an S4 heart sound, and the apical impulse may be more prominent. Figure 12-4: Clinical consequences of the increased left ventricular wall stress from aortic stenosis. Prognosis is related to AS severity and symptoms. If the stenosis is severe, then the symptoms provide the most important guide to the prognosis (Table 12-1).  12 5 \\nSymptom Angina Syncope Heart Failure Mean Survival 5 years 3 years 2 years Atrial Fibrillation 6 months Table 12-1: Mean survival with symptoms in aortic stenosis without aortic valve replacement. Evaluation of Stenosis Severity When evaluating stenosis, there are three primary measures of severity - (1) peak velocity of the blood flow across the valve; (2) the pressure gradient across the valve, which as noted previously can be reported as mean gradient, peak instantaneous gradient or a peak-to-peak gradient; and (3) aortic valve area, which is the cross-sectional area of the orifice. Severe aortic stenosis is defined as peak velocity > 4 meters/second, mean pressure gradient >40 mm Hg or valve area <1.0 cm2. The reason for using multiple measures of severity is each metric has it\\'s weaknesses. For example, the pressure gradient is dependent on flow across the valve whereas aortic valve area can be prone to error from inaccurate 2D measurements in echocardiography. To measure the pressure gradient, we can insert a pressure transducer into the heart. This procedure is through cardiac catheterization and can be routinely performed at all large medical centers. However, more commonly, cardiac catheterization has been replaced by echocardiographic techniques, which provide the same physiological information without being invasive and can provide more detailed anatomical information. The Bernoulli equation based on conservation of mass in a closed system describes the relationship between velocity and pressure gradient. In the case of a stenotic valve, the equation is simplified to disregard the effect of friction and gravity. The relationship of velocity and pressure across a valve is P1 - P2 = 4x(V2^2 - V1^2). This is called the simplified Bernoulli equation, where P1 and V1 refer to the pre-valve pressure and velocity respectively, P2 and V2 refer to the post-valve pressure and velocity respectively, and 𝝆 is the specific gravity of blood. This indicates that the difference in proximal (P1) and distal (P2) pressures (ie the pressure gradient: P1-P2) is proportional to the difference between the squared distal (V2) and proximal (V1) velocities. If we make the appropriate substitutions, with pressure in mm Hg and velocity in m/s, the equation becomes: P1 - P2 = 4 x (V2^2 - V1^2). We can now use this equation to calculate the effect of increasing velocities across a valve. For example, say a patient with aortic stenosis has a velocity proximal to the valve of 0.8 m/s, and a velocity through the valve of 2.5 m/s. Using these values, we can calculate the valve\\'s pressure gradient: P1 - P2 = 4 x (V2^2 - V1^2). A 50% increase in velocity more than doubled the valve pressure gradient. Generally, we assume that the velocity of the blood flow proximal to the stenosis is <1 m/s and, when squared, has negligible contribution to the pressure gradient (ie pressure gradient = 4(V2)2). This assumption is incorrect if the proximal velocity is >1.5 m/s. Therefore, in most cases, the peak blood velocity measured along the left ventricular outflow tract and aortic valve can be used by itself and is the most straightforward estimate the severity of the AS.The above simplification assumes that the peak velocity measurement is truly from the blood flow across the valve and not from another stenotic lesion along the path of the ultrasound beam. It also assumes that the velocity being measured is truly the maximum velocity, which relies on minimizing difference between the angle of the blood flow compared to the angle of the ultrasound probe. As mentioned above, the change in the pressure gradient with changes in velocity can also make it difficult to determine the actual degree of valve stenosis. For example, cardiac output can be in several common clinical circumstances such as pregnancy, fever, and anemia, resulting in a high pressure gradient that overestimates the degree of aortic stenosis. Conversely, in patients with cardiomyopathy and low stroke volumes resulting in low cardiac output, resulting in a low pressure gradient that underestimates the degree of aortic stenosis. For these reasons, valve area is also used to determine stenosis severity. This method is based on the assumption the cross-sectional area of the open valve is constant, and that this area is the main determinant of hemodynamic significance. Although neither of these assumptions are completely accurate, the valve area does provide another useful estimation of stenosis severity. The simplest method of calculating the valve area is based on the principle of conservation of mass. Specifically, blood flow through one area (ie the left ventricular outflow tract) is equal to blood flow through the valve. In other words, what goes in, must come out. Blood flow (volume per time, Q ) and is equal to its velocity (distance per time, V ) multiplied by the cross-sectional area (length2, A) through which is travels (Figure 12-6). By equating the flow before the valve (in the left ventricular outflow tract) to the flow through the valve, we can calculate the valve area. Values are gathered using Doppler and 2D echocardiography. Q 1 = Q 2 to A1V 1 = A2V 2 to A2 = A1V 1 V 2 Figure 12-6: Calculation of the open valve area based on velocity. V1 represents velocity proximal to the valve, and V2 represents the peak velocity through the valve. Q1 represents flow proximal to the valve, and Q 2 represents flow through the valve. A1is the area proximal to the valve, and A2is the area of the valve orifice. Treatment of Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis is primarily a mechanical problem. If there are symptoms of significant impairment, the treatment is also mechanical, ie valve replacement. Due to the strong relationship between symptoms and survival, intervention is generally deferred until symptoms develop. There are several valve options for replacement. Mechanical valves are the most durable option but require lifelong anticoagulation therapy to prevent thrombosis. Other options include bioprosthetic valves from processed animal tissues, cryopreserved human homografts, and even autografts of the pulmonic valve. All the bioprosthetic options have a shorter lifespan than mechanical valves. The most recent development in valve replacement is a minimally invasive procedure that allows placement of an expandable bioprosthetic valve through the femoral artery without cardiac surgery (transcatheter aortic valve replacement/implantation, aka TAVR or TAVI). This procedure has allowed for valve replacement and improved quality of life for many older patients with prohibitive risk for open-heart surgery. Given the success and excellent outcomes from the procedure, FDA also approved TAVR/TAVI for intermediate surgical risk patients in 2016, and for low surgical risk patients in 2019. 8  12 \\n MITRAL STENOSIS (MS) For mitral valve stenosis (MS), we also consider the pressure gradient as a peak and mean gradient (Figure 12-7). The stenosis is considered severe if the mean gradient across the mitral valve (blue shaded area) is >10 mm Hg, or the valve area is <1.0 cm2. The physiological effect is an increase in the filling pressures of the left atrium. Figure 12-7: Pressure tracings for mitral stenosis. Physiological and Clinical Consequences of Mitral Stenosis As with aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis has physiological consequences that result in clinical consequences (Figure 12-8). The primary physiological consequence of mitral stenosis is increased left atrial pressure resulting in marked left atrial enlargement and subsequent risk of atrial fibrillation. Also, a longer diastolic filling period is now needed due to restricted flow through the MV.This slow flow, in combination with an enlarged left atrium, leads to a very high risk of thromboembolism if atrial fibrillation develops. On physical examination, mitral stenosis unusually manifests as a low-pitched, rumbling diastolic murmur, heard best at the cardiac apex. There may be a sound called an \"opening snap\" - imagine the mitral valve snapping open like a parachute. Left atrial enlargement will be seen on echocardiography and may be seen on ECG.The patient may be in atrial fibrillation. Symptoms are related to the physiological consequences. There may be dyspnea on exertion, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism, or some combination of these problems. Atrial fibrillation is not well tolerated in these patients because of tachycardia (shorter diastolic filling period) and loss of atrial systole (also known as the atrial \"kick\"). Median survival after onset of symptoms, without repair or replacement, is 7 years.  12 9 \\n Figure 12-8: Clinical consequences of mitral stenosis. Evaluation is similar to that of aortic stenosis, with echocardiography playing the primary role. The one additional measure of severity for mitral stenosis is the pressure half-time (T1/2). This is the amount of time for the pressure gradient to reduce by half (Figure 12-9). Figure 12-9: Pressure half time in Mitral Stenosis. Treatment of Mitral Stenosis In contrast to aortic stenosis, there are more non-surgical treatment alternatives for mitral stenosis. In mitral stenosis, given the heart\\'s increased dependence on diastolic filling period, using rate control and maintenance of sinus rhythm can significantly improve symptoms. Balloon valvuloplasty is also very effective, used more frequently than commissurotomy (partially separating the two leaflets surgically). Finally, should these medical and less invasive options fail to relieve symptoms, or there is concurrently significant mitral regurgitation (balloon valvuloplasty won\\'t correct mitral regurgitation), surgical replacement options are available. 10  12 \\n COMPARISON OF AORTIC AND MITRAL STENOSIS A comparison of the physiological consequences of aortic versus mitral stenosis is made in Table 12-2, while the clinical symptoms are contrasted in Table 12-3.

VALVULAR REGURGITATION Leakage of a valve is termed regurgitation. In the case of either mitral or aortic regurgitation, the leakage will result in an increase in left ventricular preload. This is because left ventricular end-diastolic volume consists of the regurgitant volume and the \"effective\" or \"forward\" stroke volume that will successfully enter the systemic circulation. Quantification of a regurgitant valve is less standardized than for a stenotic valve. In most clinical situations, the method is semi-quantitative, and based on integrating data over time. One quantitative method is to calculate the regurgitant fraction (RF). The RF is the percentage of ventricular stroke volume that is regurgitated back through a valve. The volume of blood that is regurgitated back through a valve, the regurgitant volume, is calculated as the difference between the total stroke volume and the stroke volume that effectively enters the systemic  12 11 \\n(in case of the LV) or pulmonary (in case of the RV) circulation (known as the forward or effective stroke volume). Effective stroke volume can be measured using the Fick cardiac output or thermodilution cardiac output and dividing by heart rate, or by directly measuring stroke volume across another valve that is not regurgitant. Total stroke volume is measured by imaging ventricular end-diastolic volume and ventricular end-systolic volume (Total stroke volume = End diastolic volume - End systolic volume). This can be done by echocardiography, contrast ventriculography, or MRI.PHYSIOLOGY OF VALVE LEAKAGE Part of the stroke volume does not contribute to effective cardiac output. Aortic regurgitation Mitral regurgitation In diastole, part of the stroke volume returns from the aorta to the LV This regurgitant volume adds to LV filling from the LA in diastole In systole, part of the stroke volume returns from the LV to LA.  This regurgitant volume adds to LA volume, and thus to the LV filling in diastole Net result is increased LV filling Increased LV end-diastolic volume Increased LV end-diastolic pressure Increased LV stroke volume   Table 12-4: Physiology of valvular regurgitation. AORTIC REGURGITATION (AR) Etiologies of Aortic Regurgitation The most common etiologies of aortic regurgitation (AR) include rheumatic heart disease, congenital (bicuspid) lesions, degenerative disease, infections, and annular dilation. These causes are similar to the etiologies of most valvular heart diseases, with the addition of annular dilation. Given the anatomic relationship between the ascending aorta and the aortic annulus, if there is dilation of the ascending aorta, the aortic annulus may be distorted and enlarged, leading to abnormal leaflet coaptation (ie the leaflets are not properly drawn together to create a closed valve) and thus, regurgitation. Physiological and Clinical Consequences of Mitral Stenosis The main problem in aortic regurgitation is that there is reverse movement of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. When this is significant, it can lead to a cascade of physiological consequences including an increase in left 12  12 \\n ventricular diastolic volume and pressure, and a decrease in the systemic diastolic pressure. This increased diastolic volume leads to an increase in LV ejection fraction, LV enlargement (ie a larger diameter and volume, not thickness) and subsequent LA enlargement. A secondary consequence is the potential for development of myocardial ischemia and angina with exertion due to decreased coronary artery blood flow. Myocardial perfusion during diastole can decrease as the diastolic pressure in the wall of the ventricle increases and aortic diastolic pressure falls (Figure 12-10). Figure 12-10: Pressure tracings for Aortic Regurgitation. During regurgitation (blue arrow), the aortic pressure rapidly falls as blood regurgitates from the aorta into the left ventricle. As with other valvular heart disease, the clinical symptoms and signs of aortic regurgitation can be related to the physiological consequences (Figure 12-11). The clinical progression and course of aortic regurgitation is quite variable. Once the degree of regurgitation has progressed to a significant level, there is still variability in the patient\\'s survival and symptoms. The key findings that indicate a poor outcome without intervention are left ventricular dilation and left ventricular dysfunction, along with their associated symptoms. Notably, 60% of patients with significant aortic regurgitation have normal LV function and no symptoms for 10 years. However, patients with symptoms of angina have an average of 4 year survival, and patients with symptoms of heart failure have an average of 2 year survival. In aortic regurgitation, afterload reduction has been shown to slow disease progression. When the patient has signs of severe left ventricular dilation and/or worsening left ventricular function, even without symptoms, surgical replacement is indicated.  12 13 \\nFigure 12-11: Clinical consequences of aortic regurgitation MITRAL REGURGITATION (MR) Etiologies of Mitral Regurgitation The etiologies for regurgitation are numerous and generally more than for stenosis. Common causes of mitral regurgitation (MR) include: Myxomatous degeneration Mitral annular dilation Ruptured mitral chordae tendinae Ventricular dilation   Leaflet or chord abnormality Congenital Rheumatic Ischemic disease Infection Note that in addition to the usual causes of valvular disease (Figure 12-1), there are a few additional mechanisms that can cause mitral regurgitation. For example, MR can be due to a distorted and enlarged mitral valve annulus. This is most commonly the result of left ventricular dilation. Left ventricular dilation can also cause the papillary muscles to move away from each other and the valve. The chordae that tether the leaflets to the papillary muscles then prevent the leaflets from closing properly. In ischemic disease, the papillary muscles may be weakened due to ischemia and/or infarction, leading to inadequate support of the mitral valve via the chordae. Mitral valve prolapse occurs when the mitral leaflets sag (prolapse) past the mitral annulus into the left atrium during systole. There are many different causes, including but not limited to genetic disorders of connective tissue such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, myxomatous degeneration, and simply as 14  12 \\n a normal variant. The significance of mitral valve prolapse depends on the cause and on the severity of any associated mitral regurgitation. Physiological and Clinical Consequences of Mitral Regurgitation In mitral regurgitation, the main defect is the flow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium during systole. If the amount is significant, it will result in a significant volume increase of the left atrium, and subsequent increase in left atrial pressure (Figure 12-12). Figure 12-12: Physiology of mitral regurgitation. There is also an increase in flow across the mitral valve, which may cause a diastolic murmur in addition to the harsh systolic murmur of mitral regurgitation. The physiological and clinical consequences are illustrated in Figure 12-13. Figure 12-13: Clinical symptoms and findings in mitral regurgitation.  12 15 \\nA trace or mild degree of mitral regurgitation is common as a normal variant. Once the degree of regurgitation reaches moderate or more, it is considered abnormal. The rate of progression is highly variable, and symptoms do not usually occur until the degree of regurgitation becomes severe. The main treatment for MR is diuretics to reduce symptoms. Afterload reduction (ie with vasodilators) also reduces symptoms, but there is no evidence that it is effective in altering the progression of the clinical course. If there is severe mitral regurgitation with significant left ventricular dilation, decreased left ventricular function, or the patient is symptomatic, surgical repair or replacement of the valve is recommended. The 5 year survival rate with severe MR is 45%. A comparison of the physiological consequences of aortic and mitral regurgitation is made in Table 12-5. Change LV size LV stiffness Aortic Regurgitation Mitral Regurgitation Increased Increased Increased Increased LV Ejection Fraction High normal High normal LA size Pulmonary venous pressure Systemic diastolic blood pressure Increased Increased Greatly increased Greatly increased Decreased Normal Table 12-5: Physiological consequences of aortic vs mitral regurgitation. ENDOCARDITIS PROPHYLAXIS Although patients with valvular heart disease are at increased risk of infective endocarditis, studies do not strongly support antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures. At the present time, antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended for the highest risk patients prior to dental procedures. This includes patients with prosthetic heart valves, patients with a history of valve repair involving the use of prosthetic material including annuloplasty rings and/or artificial chords, patients with prior infective endocarditis, heart transplant patients with valve regurgitation in association with a structurally abnormal valve and select patients with congenital heart disease. Endocarditis prophylaxis is not required before gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures in the absence of an active infection. HEART SOUNDS Although echocardiography is of great value in diagnosing and quantifying valvular heart disease, the usual first detected sign of valvular heart disease is a murmur on auscultation of the heart. When listening to the heart, there are a number of different sounds which can be heard. The most common are listed in Table 12-6. 16  12 \\n Sounds that are routinely heard when there is no pathology and are listed below as \"Normal.\" Sounds that may indicate significant pathology and are listed as \"Pathological\". Normal Pathological S1 - closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves S2 - closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves S3 - Early filling (gallop) S4 - Atrial contraction (gallop) Clicks or snaps murmurs rubs Table 12-6: Classification of heart sounds. The second heart sound (S2) deserves special attention since fixed splitting can be detected on exam and can indicate an atrial septal defect, which can otherwise be difficult to detect. S2 consists of two sounds: A2 (aortic valve closure) and P2 (pulmonic valve closure). Normally the sound of P2 occurs later than the sound of A2 because of the differences in activation of the respective ventricles cause by differences in conduction through the right and left bundles. In addition, P2 is variably delayed due to variations in filling of the right ventricle. When the patient is supine and/or inhales, there is an increase in venous return of blood to the right ventricle. This increased volume results in an increased RV ejection time. As a result, P2 (pulmonic valve closure) is delayed. When the patient exhales, there is decreased venous return to the right ventricle, and consequently, right ventricular ejection is more rapid, resulting in P2 occurring closer to A2. This variation is called \"physiological splitting of S2\" and is illustrated in Figure 12-14A.In an atrial septal defect (an opening in the septal wall between the right atrium and left atrium), blood from the LA enters the RA, resulting in increased volume sent to the right ventricle, regardless of inspiration or expiration. Consequently, P2 is consistently very delayed compared to A2. Any respiratory difference is so small as to be undetectable. This is called \"Fixed splitting of S2\" (Figure 12-14C). Learning to hear S2 is thus worth doing. It is best done by listening to the heart with the patient in the supine position in a quiet room, using the diaphragm of the stethoscope, and auscultating at the upper sternal border, usually on the left, but sometimes best heard on the right. By listening carefully to S2, you will notice one of two normal variations. In some patients, it is possible to hear two sounds very close together during inspiration, which become a single sound during expiration. In other subjects, there is only one S2 sound throughout the respiratory cycle, but the quality of the sound varies, becoming lower in frequency or muffled during inspiration, and higher in frequency or sharper during expiration.  12 17 \\nFigure 12-14: Types of splitting. By characterizing a murmur, you can narrow down the diagnostic possibilities. There are multiple ways to characterize murmurs (Table 12-7). Description of Murmurs Timing - systolic, diastolic, or continuous Intensity - systolic grade 3 (easily heard) is usually pathological Pitch/Character - high frequency indicates a high pressure gradient Shape - variation during the murmur (ie crescendo) Location - indicates the valve source Radiation - indicates the direction of blood flow Table 12-7: How to classify murmurs.  12 18 \\n The intensity of a murmur is graded on a 6-point subjective scale (Table 12-8). The exact details differ between authors, but generally grade 1 is very faint, and only heard in a quiet room, and requires some effort to hear. Grade 2 is heard without difficulty but is still rather soft. Grade 3 is very easily heard but does not meet the criteria of grade 4. Grade 4 is very loud, but not heard if the stethoscope is not in contact with the skin. It is almost always accompanied by a palpable vibration, called a thrill. Grade 5 is heard even when the stethoscope breaks contact with the skin, and grade 6 is heard with the stethoscope placed close to, but not on, the patient. Grade Loudness Thrill 1 2 3 4 5 6 Faint Soft Very easily heard Loud Partial Contact No Contact No No No Yes Yes Yes Table 12-8: Grading intensity of murmurs. Determining the pitch, or frequency, can be aided by comparing the sound as heard with the bell and with the diaphragm of the stethoscope. The bell passes all frequencies, while the diaphragm filters out low frequencies. If the murmur sounds similar with both, it is high-pitched. If it is best heard with the bell, it is low-pitched. If it sounds different, but similarly loud with both, it has mixed frequencies. By using a combination of the timing, intensity, pitch, shape, location, and radiation pattern of a murmur, it is possible to narrow the potential causes, and in many cases, determine the exact diagnosis. The patterns associated with the valvular heart diseases discussed in this chapter are listed in Table 12-9.  12 19 \\nDiagnosis Timing Intensity AS AR MS MR Systolic Diastolic Diastolic Systolic > 3 < 3 < 2 > 3 Pitch High, harsh Shape Location Radiation Crescendo- decrescendo RUSB Carotids High Decrescendo RUSB Low Decrescendo Apex Apex None High, blowing Holosystolic Apex Axilla Table 12-9: Typical features of murmurs of valvular heart disease. 20  12 \\n Chapter 13 Coronary Blood Flow and Angina Authors: Eric Feigl, MD, and B.Fendley Stewart, MD INTRODUCTION At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Describe coronary autoregulation, phasic coronary blood flow, and transmural coronary blood flow. Explain the three factors that modulate myocardial oxygen consumption. Describe the three hemodynamic factors that cause angina pectoris during exercise in a patient with coronary atherosclerosis. Describe how aortic valve disease may cause angina pectoris. Describe typical angina and its risk factors. Describe an algorithm for the evaluation and rationale in treatment of patients with stable angina. CORONARY ANATOMY The heart is supplied by the first two branches of the aorta: the right and left coronary arteries. These vessels course over the epicardial surface of the heart like a primitive crown - hence the term coronary. Branches of the coronary arteries then penetrate the myocardium from the epicardium to the endocardium. The left coronary artery generally supplies the anterior portion of the interventricular septum, the anterior and lateral walls of the left ventricle, and the apex of the left ventricle. The supply to the posterior portion of the interventricular septum and the diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle is variable. In about 90% of human hearts, the right coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery and a small artery to the atrioventricular node (AV node). This is known as a \"dominant right coronary artery.\" The dominant right coronary artery often has a distal branch to the inferior and posterior walls of the left ventricle. In the remaining individuals, the circumflex coronary artery supplies the posterior descending artery and AV node branch as well as the inferior and posterior walls of the left ventricle. This is referred to as a \"dominant left coronary artery.\" As might be expected, with both the circumflex and arteries diaphragmatic the supplying is surface of the heart, considerable variation the proportion of blood supply derived from each of these vessels. In a few individuals, the blood supply of the diaphragmatic surface is \"balanced\" between right coronary and left circumflex vessels. there in the right coronary  13 1 Figure 13-1: Coronary circulation \\nCORONARY CIRCULATION Figure 13-2: Architecture of the coronary circulation. Normal human hearts have a capillary density of 3300 per mm2. Contrast this with skeletal muscle which has a capillary density of about 400 capillaries per mm2. In the heart, there is approximately one capillary for each muscle fiber. This ratio is maintained in cardiac hypertrophy, but the diffusion distance from capillary to the center of a muscle fiber increases. Thebesian veins (Figure 13-2) drain directly into the ventricular and atrial chambers without passing through an epicardial vein. There are approximately six arterial shunts, 80-200 um in diameter, emptying directly into the ventricular chambers. The function of these shunts is unknown. The normal myocardium contains numerous collateral arteries between major branches of a coronary artery and between right and left coronary arteries. Collateral vessels are important in patients with coronary atherosclerosis. If an epicardial artery closes slowly as the result of atherosclerosis progression, there is time for collateral vessels to enlarge and provide blood flow to the affected area. This can prevent or limit myocardial infarction. Conversely, in acute coronary syndromes the sudden closure or severe narrowing of an epicardial coronary artery generally leads to tissue ischemia and infarction as collateral vessels do not have time to enlarge. CORONARY AUTOREGULATION The coronary circulation exhibits significant autoregulation (Figure 13-3). Below the autoregulatory range (coronary pressure <60 mm Hg) the coronary arterioles are maximally dilated. When the coronary circulation is maximally dilated, flow is even more dependent on pressure (eg a small decrease in pressure will decrease flow). The difference between the coronary blood flow and the potential coronary blood flow that occurs with maximum dilation is called the vasodilator reserve. In 2  13 \\n Figure 13-3 below, the vasodilator reserve is 2.0 ml/min/g (2.5 ml/min/g - 0.5 ml/min/g) when the heart is at low metabolism and the coronary perfusion pressure is 100 mm Hg. This reserve falls to approximately 1.5 ml/min/g (2.5 ml/min/g - 1.0 ml/min/g) at medium metabolism because additional vasodilatation has already occurred to support the higher metabolism. Figure 13-3: Autoregulation at medium and low metabolism. PHASIC AND TRANSMURAL FLOW Coronary artery flow is large during diastole and small during systole (Figure 13- 4A). This occurs despite the fact that aortic blood pressure is greater during left ventricular ejection than when the aortic valve is closed (Figure 13-4B). The shaded area during diastole in Figure 13-4B represents the potential time interval for coronary flow. The difference in perfusion between systole and diastole occurs because the myocardium squeezes down on its own blood flow during systole. Since the ventricle depends on coronary blood flow during diastole, low aortic diastolic pressure (such as with arterial hypotension or severe aortic valve regurgitation) can compromise myocardial perfusion. Tachycardia can also compromise myocardial perfusion because diastole is shortened. The subendocardium is only perfused during diastole (Figure 13-5). This is because, during systole, systolic compression of intramyocardial vessels is greatest in the subendocardium. During diastole, ventricular muscle is relaxed, and  13 3 \\nthe pressure throughout the wall is decreased. Note in Figure 13-5 that the subendocardium is also the last area to be perfused during diastole. Figure 13-4: Phasic coronary blood flow (A) and corresponding pressure changes (B) through the cardiac cycle. Figure 13-5: Transmural flow. Systolic compression of intramyocardial vessels in the left ventricle is greatest in the subendocardium and generates retrograde flow during systole. At the onset of diastole, antegrade flow must refill the penetrating vessels in order for there to be flow through the microcirculation to the subendocardium. 4  13 \\n The subendocardium is closest to the left ventricular (LV) cavity, so pressure in the cavity during diastole will be felt by the subendocardium more than the other layers of the myocardium. The perfusion pressure of the subendocardium is the difference between aortic diastolic pressure and LV cavity diastolic pressure. Thus, in addition to low aortic diastolic pressure and tachycardia, an elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure can decrease subendocardial perfusion. This can be countered by coronary vasodilation. Interestingly, although the inner layers of the left ventricle are more vulnerable to ischemia than the outer layers, the blood flow to the subendocardium is typically 10% greater than blood flow to the subepicardium both at rest and during exercise. This is because myocardial oxygen consumption is slightly greater in the inner layers of the left ventricle than in the outer layers, and the dominant controller of coronary blood flow is myocardial oxygen consumption. MYOCARDIAL METABOLISM At rest, the AVO2 difference of coronary blood flow is relatively high compared to most organs of the body. This is because 70% of the oxygen delivered by coronary blood flow is extracted by the myocardium. This is the largest oxygen extraction of any organ in the body. Given this high baseline oxygen extraction, any increase or decrease in myocardial oxygen consumption ( MV O2 ) must be promptly accommodated by a corresponding change in coronary blood flow. This is accomplished by coupling metabolic activity to the resistance of coronary arterioles. Specifically, an increase in MV O2 leads to increased generation of local vasodilatory factors. A decrease in MV O2 consumption has the opposite effect. Determinants of MV O2 The three major determinants of myocardial V O2 are (1) contractility, (2) heart rate, and (3) ventricular wall stress. Experimentally, when the heart is arrested in a high external K+ solution, MV O2 decreases to 25% of the previous resting value. This can be considered the general cost of cardiac \"housekeeping\" independent of contraction. Thus, we can infer that ~75% of MV O2is related to cardiac contractility. Recall that contractility is a measure of the force of contraction. An increase in contractility will increase myocardial oxygen demand. Conversely, agents with negative inotropic effects, such as beta1-blockers, decrease oxygen demand and thus decrease MV O2. Heart rate is a major determinant of MV O2. As heart rate increases, the number of contractions and the amount of ATP consumed per minute increase. Thus, there is an approximately linear relationship between heart rate and MV O2. Ventricular wall stress is the third major determinant of MV O2. Wall stress is the tangential force on the myocardial fibers that tends to pull them apart. The amount of wall stress that develops is related to the pressure on the wall, the degree to which the wall is stretched (measured by the internal chamber radius), and the thickness of the wall. This relationship can be approximated by the law of LaPlace:  13 5 \\n where 𝜎 = ΔP x r 2h 𝜎 = wall stress ΔP = the transmural pressure gradient (from endocardium to epicardium) r = internal radius of the cavity h = wall thickness. From this equation, we see that the systolic ventricular pressure is directly proportional to wall stress. Conditions that increase this pressure, such as hypertension, will increase wall stress and consequently increase MV O2. Agents that lower this pressure, such as anti-hypertensive medications, will lower wall stress and consequently lower MV O2. The internal radius of the left ventricle is also directly proportional to wall stress. Lowering LV preload, and thus decreasing r, will decrease wall stress and MV O2. As you will see in the next section, these strategies are used in the treatment of angina. Finally, the greater the wall thickness, the lower the wall stress since force is now spread over a larger muscle mass. Wall thickening or hypertrophy is a compensatory mechanism in chronic hypertension, valve disease, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophy decreases wall stress and oxygen consumption per gram of tissue. NITRIC OXIDE Nitric oxide (NO) was originally known as Endothelium Derived Relaxing Factor (EDRF). It is released by vascular endothelial cells in response to shear stress caused by blood flowing over their surface. Nitric oxide (a free radical gas) diffuses from the endothelial cells to adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells, where it activates guanylyl cyclase to form cGMP from GTP.cGMP acts to lower intracellular Ca2+ in the smooth muscle and cause relaxation. When downstream arterioles in the coronary circulation dilate due to local metabolic vasodilation, this increases the flow and endothelial shear stress on the upstream epicardial coronary arteries. The release of NO will dilate the epicardial vessel. The nitric oxide mechanism adjusts upstream vessel diameter so that shear stress on the endothelium is in the physiological range. Too much shear stress denudes endothelium from the vascular wall and may result in thrombosis, while too low shear stress leads to atherosclerosis, stasis, and thrombosis. Nitric oxide can also be released by acetylcholine (ACh) acting on muscarinic receptors on endothelial cells. In the normal coronary circulation, an infusion of acetylcholine results in coronary vasodilation. Interestingly this effect is lost or may be reversed in atherosclerotic coronary arteries. One hypothesis is that oxygen free radicals present in the atherosclerotic vessel wall inactivate nitric oxide. 6  13 \\n EPICARDIAL CORONARY STENOSIS.A stenosis is a narrowing in diameter. In coronary artery stenosis, this narrowing can result in restriction of blood flow. The degree of flow restriction depends upon the degree of stenosis. In Figure 13-6, we see that at rest, a stenosis of 80% is needed to restrict flow. However, with exercise, a 50% or greater stenosis will start to limit coronary blood flow. The reasons for this include: 1. The pressure drop across a stenosis 2. The role of autoregulation in the coronary microcirculation 3. Tachycardia during exercise Figure 13-6: Coronary blood flow as a function of myocardial metabolism and coronary artery narrowing. Pressure across a Stenosis In a patient with coronary stenosis, the pressure drop across the stenosis can cause a reduction of coronary blood flow and subsequent subendocardial ischemia. This occurs because pressure is lost across a stenosis due to friction along the entrance and throat of the narrowed section. As blood flow exits the stenosis, it separates from the wall (Figure 13-7). This flow separation and the formation of eddies prevent complete pressure recovery at the exit. Thus, the pressure distal to stenosis is lower than normal. This distal pressure is also the perfusion pressure of the tissue that the artery supplies. If the stenosis continues to increase, the perfusion pressure will continue to fall, and even maximum dilation of the distal arterioles will not be enough to maintain adequate tissue perfusion.  13 7 \\n Figure 13-7: Pressure drop across a stenosis. Variables represented are proximal perfusion pressure (Pa), coronary pressure and flow velocity distal to the stenosis (Pd and Vd, respectively), and the venous pressure (Pv), which is usually assumed to be negligible. ΔP is the difference between Pd and Pa . Normal diameter (Dn), stenosis diameter (Ds), proximal velocity (Vn), and stenosis velocity (Vs) are indicated. (Ref: Van de Hoef,et al. Nat. Rev. Cardiol. 2013;10:439) Coronary autoregulation The second factor is the exhaustion of vasodilator reserve in the coronary microcirculation as perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis falls (Figure 13-3). Below the autoregulatory range (<60 mm Hg) the coronary microcirculation is maximally dilated and there is no more vasodilator reserve. In Figure 13-3, a coronary perfusion pressure of 70 mm Hg and maximum dilation of the distal arterioles will just barely support the coronary blood flow for medium metabolism (this is the point where the medium metabolism curve meets the maximum vasodilation curve). Coronary blood flow cannot increase further at that perfusion pressure, so if myocardial oxygen consumption increases, subendocardial ischemia will develop. Tachycardia The third factor is tachycardia during exercise, which increases myocardial oxygen consumption. Moreover, the coronary arteries fill during diastole. By increasing heart rate, diastole is abbreviated, resulting in less time for coronary filling. MICROVASCULAR DISEASE As discussed above, vasodilation of coronary arterioles is triggered by an increase in tissue myocardial oxygen consumption, and this results in an increase in tissue perfusion until there is match between oxygen demand and supply. This change in arteriolar tone is mediated by endothelial-dependent and endothelial- independent mechanisms. If coronary microvascular function is abnormal, the vasodilatory response to increases in myocardial oxygen consumption may be insufficient and lead to oxygen demand/supply mismatch. AORTIC VALVE DISEASE Aortic valve disease can cause myocardial ischemia without coronary narrowing or microvascular disease. In severe aortic regurgitation, lower aortic diastolic pressure and higher left ventricular diastolic pressure result in a decrease in perfusion pressure and coronary blood flow during diastole. The higher left ventricular diastolic pressure results in higher wall stress and thus, oxygen  13 8 \\n demand. The higher oxygen demand and lower supply can result in myocardial ischemia. The pressure changes of normal aortic valve function and severe aortic valve regurgitation are illustrated in Figures 13-8 and 13-9, respectively. Compare the diastolic pressure gradients between the aorta and left ventricle. Figure 13-8: Normal cardiac and aortic pressures.  13 9 \\nFigure 13-9: Left ventricular and aortic pressure tracings aortic regurgitation. Figure 13-10: Cardiac and aortic pressures in aortic stenosis 10  13 \\n In aortic stenosis, there is an abnormal systolic pressure difference between the left ventricle and the aorta (Figure 13-10). During exercise the systolic pressure gradient from left ventricle to aorta increases as the heart attempts to increase stroke volume through the stenotic aortic valve. However, the stenotic valve creates a significant increase in resistance, so a larger and larger pressure difference is needed to increase flow through the stenosis (recall that Q = ΔP R/ ). This can result in peak pressure differences across the aortic valve of 100 mm Hg or more. The high left ventricular systolic pressure results in high levels of wall stress and myocardial oxygen consumption. The situation can be further complicated by aortic pressure being relatively lower during exertion. Lower aortic pressure can occur in severe aortic stenosis because the decrease in peripheral resistance caused by metabolic vasodilation in exercising skeletal muscle is not accompanied by the normal increase in cardiac stroke volume and cardiac output. The combination of high myocardial oxygen demand, lower aortic diastolic pressure, and abbreviation of diastole with tachycardia during exercise can result in subendocardial ischemia and angina pectoris. ANGINA Angina is an uncomfortable sensation in the chest and neighboring anatomic structures due to myocardial ischemia. It is often described as substernal chest pressure or tightness, which can radiate to the arms, neck, or jaw, and can be associated with nausea, diaphoresis, or dyspnea. Patients can also present with dyspnea as the primary symptom (more common in women and patients with diabetes). Angina lasts minutes (not seconds) and is not sharp, pleuritic, positional, nor associated with tenderness to palpation. In this chapter we will focus on stable angina. Stable angina is defined as angina that occurs with exertion and is relieved by rest or nitroglycerin. When angina progresses to occur with less exertion than previously (\"crescendo\" angina), or is not relieved by rest, this is called unstable angina. We will discuss unstable angina in the next chapter. The degree of angina can be classified using the Canadian Cardiovascular Society\\'s grading scheme. You do not need to memorize this, but rather, it is listed below for interest (Table 13-1). Coronary atherosclerosis is the most common cause of angina. Risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) are listed in Table 13-2. A patient\\'s risk of coronary heart disease can be predicted using several algorithms including the ACC/AHA risk calculator. Notably, low socioeconomic status (SES) is an independent risk factor that is not accounted for in many risk scores. As a result, CHD risk is underestimated for patients in this group. In the PURE trial 156,000 individuals from 17 low, middle, and high-income countries were followed prospectively. A CHD risk score suggested higher baseline risk in the high-income country population, yet the incidence of total cardiovascular disease was equivalent in all three groups.  13 11 \\nMoreover, cardiovascular mortality was much higher in the middle- and low-income populations (Figure 13-11). The investigators speculated that factors contributing to the higher mortality among the lower SES groups could include access to and affordability of health services and medications for both primary prevention and acute treatment of cardiovascular events. The investigators also observed \"greater use of preventive drugs and coronary revascularization, better control of hypertension, and lower current smoking rates (all markers of better health care systems) in high-income countries, which may mitigate higher risk-factor levels in those countries.\" Table 13-1: Canadian Cardiovascular Society\\'s Angina Pectoris Grades Hypertension High Cholesterol Diabetes Obesity Cigarette smoking Diet Coronary Heart Disease Risk Factors Family history of coronary heart disease Age Male sex Psychosocial stress Socioeconomic status Sedentary lifestyle - High glycemic index and consumption of red meat or trans fatty acids - Low consumption of fruit, vegetables, of fiber Table 13-2: Coronary heart disease risk factors. 12  13 GradeDescriptionGrade IOrdinary\\xa0physical\\xa0activity\\xa0does\\xa0not\\xa0cause\\xa0angina,\\xa0such\\xa0as\\xa0walking\\xa0 and\\xa0climbing\\xa0stairs.\\xa0\\xa0Angina\\xa0with\\xa0strenuous\\xa0or rapid\\xa0or\\xa0prolonged exertion\\xa0at\\xa0work\\xa0or\\xa0recreation\\xa0Grade IISlight limitation of ordinary activity.

Ref: Yusef et al. N Engl J Med 2014;371:818-27. Angina can occur in patients with microvascular coronary disease even without significant obstruction of the epicardial coronary arteries. Microvascular disease appears to be the primary cause of angina in up to 25% of the 1+ million patients undergoing coronary angiography in the US each year. Women appear to be at higher risk of microvascular disease, and additional risk factors include advancing age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and dyslipidemia. Although epicardial coronary atherosclerosis starts at an early age, clinical symptoms of coronary heart disease are uncommon prior to the fifth decade of life (Figure 13-12). The lifetime risk of developing clinical CHD after age 40 years in the US is estimated at 49% for men and 32% for women. Compensatory expansive remodeling of the coronary arteries appears to contribute to a delay in the clinical expression of coronary atherosclerosis. The lumen diameter is maintained until the plaque area increases to more than 40% of the total cross-sectional area of the artery (Figure 13-13). As the atherosclerotic process continues into adulthood, complications eventually develop. Once coronary expansion is exhausted, gradual lumen narrowing can lead to reduced coronary blood flow with exertion and stable angina. Acute coronary syndromes can also occur, and they will be discussed in the next chapter.  13 13 \\nFigure 13-12: Prevalence of coronary heart disease by age and sex. Mozaffarian D et al, Circulation. 2015;131:e29. Figure 13-13: Coronary Expansive Remodeling. Evaluation of Stable Angina When a patient presents with symptoms of stable angina, they should undergo an ECG exercise stress test. The goal is to reproduce the anginal episode while undergoing diagnostic testing to evaluate if the cause is coronary heart disease. However, exercise stress testing is contingent on the ability to exercise and a normal baseline ECG (Figure 13-14). 14  13 \\n these agents Patients who are unable to exercise (ie those with hip or knee arthritis) instead undergo pharmacologic stress testing using vasodilators (adenosine) or inotropes (dobutamine). Administration of is usually combined with radionucleotide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) or echocardiography to detect regions of impaired myocardial perfusion. For patients with an abnormal baseline ECG but able to exercise, echocardiography or rMPI is performed after exercise to assess for ischemia. Because ischemic myocardium loses contractility, echocardiography can detect abnormal wall motion as an indicator of Ischemia. In myocardial perfusion imaging, a radionuclide (IV thallium-201 or technetium-99) is administered at peak exercise, after which imaging is performed. The radionuclide accumulates where viable myocardial cells receive perfusion. Areas of reduced uptake on the image indicate areas with reduced perfusion or non-viable myocardium. This suggests probable coronary heart disease. Figure 13-15: Algorithm for evaluation of stable angina. Exercise Stress Test Exercise testing can be used to bring out the symptoms, signs, and ECG changes of myocardial ischemia. Standardized treadmill protocols are used in clinical practice, including the Bruce protocol developed at the University of Washington. The Bruce protocol consists of three-minute stages with the treadmill speed and incline increasing in each stage. A 12-lead ECG and blood pressure are monitored during the test, and the test is stopped after any of the following: - Achievement of the maximum heart rate (220 - Age)  13 15 \\n- Marked ST-segment changes indicative of ischemia (Figure 13-16) - A fall in blood pressure below the patient\\'s baseline - A significant arrhythmia. - Development of limiting symptoms. (Note that signs and symptoms indicative of ischemia are listed in Figure 13-17). Figure 13-16: ST segment changes in myocardial ischemia. Figure 13-17: Physical Signs of Myocardial Ischemia. Exercise capacity has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality in men and women with and without cardiovascular disease. Exercise capacity on the Bruce protocol is described as the exercise time (minutes) or the metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved (1 MET is the rate of oxygen consumption at rest). Nomograms are available which allow comparison of a patient\\'s exercise capacity to that of an age-matched \"normal\" individual. 16  13 \\n The Duke score has been shown to be a reasonably good risk stratification tool in patients with chest pain. This score includes exercise capacity, ST-segment depression, and angina. The score was derived from individuals being evaluated for chest pain. The Duke score (DS) is calculated as: DS = (exercise time) - (5 x flat or downsloping ST depression) - (4 x angina index) where exercise time is in minutes, and ST depression is in millimeters. For the angina index: A low-risk Duke score is associated with a low annual mortality of only 0.25%, a reassuring finding for the patient and physician (Table 13-3). If the Duke score is moderate (-10 to +4) or high (<-10), angiography should be considered. 0 = no angina 1 = non-limiting angina 2 = limiting angina. Table 13-3: Duke score. Survival according to risk groups based on Duke Treadmill Scores. Diagnosis of Coronary Atherosclerosis Coronary angiography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of epicardial coronary atherosclerosis and determination of disease severity. Notably, coronary angiography may miss early atherosclerotic disease because lumen narrowing develops relatively late in the course of the disease. Microvascular coronary disease can be diagnosed during coronary angiography by measuring the change in coronary blood flow in response to intracoronary injections of adenosine and acetylcholine. Intracoronary ultrasound (IVUS) is a tool less commonly used to assess the coronary artery wall, including plaque volume and characteristics such as lipid core size. Clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering therapy have utilized IVUS to show regression of plaque volume. Examples of intracoronary ultrasound will be shown during the lecture. Although coronary angiography is the gold standard, it has limited accuracy of disease severity due to the 2-dimensional view of a 3-dimensional stenosis. It can overestimate or underestimate lesion severity, especially when only moderate stenosis (40-80%) is present. The addition of Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) to  13 17 \\nangiography can help us better estimate disease severity. FFR is measured by passing a wire with a pressure transducer through a stenosis in the coronary artery and determining the ratio of the intracoronary pressure distal and proximal to the lesion. If there is no lesion, FFR is 1.0. A value below 0.8 is diagnostic of myocardial ischemia. Figure 13-18: Assessment using Fractional Flow Reserve. Ref: Bhatt DL.JAMA.2018;320(12):1275-1276 18  13 \\n TREATMENT OF STABLE ANGINA For patients with stable angina from coronary heart disease, and without high risk results on a stress test, medical management is the initial treatment. This includes: A alpha-blocker to lower the resting and exercise heart rate, thus raising the activity threshold for angina. For patients who do not tolerate alpha-blockers, non- dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) are used instead. If angina persists despite adequate alpha-blockade, long-acting nitrates or dihydropyridine CCBs are used for coronary vasodilation. Nitrates also lower LV preload and consequently, wall stress and myocardial oxygen demand.   Sublingual nitroglycerin is used as needed for breakthrough episodes of angina by providing quick onset of coronary vasodilation and reduction in LV preload. ACE-Inhibitors or dihydropyridine CCBs are used for patients with hypertension to decrease systolic blood pressure and consequently, ventricular wall stress. Aspirin and lipid-lowering therapy reduce the risk of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and both should be started when a patient is diagnosed with coronary heart disease. Medical therapy for microvascular disease has not been studied prospectively, but control of risk factors including lipids, hypertension, and for patients with diabetes, and smoking cessation are microvascular coronary atherosclerosis. obstructive epicardial important disease and/or A Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil, fruits and vegetables, fish, and raw nuts is recommended for all patients along with regular exercise (at least 3 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week). Strategy decrease Risk of ACS decrease Heart Rate Treatment Anti-platelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) decrease Cholesterol (simvastatin, atorvastatin) alpha-blockers (metoprolol) Non-dihydropyridine CCB (diltiazem, verapamil) Epicardial coronary vasodilators Nitrates Dihydropyridine CCB (amlodipine) decrease Preload Nitrates decrease Afterload in patients with hypertension ACE Inhibitors Dihydropyridine CCB (amlodipine) Table 13-4: Medical therapy for angina caused by coronary atherosclerosis. Patients should be referred for coronary angiography when they have: \"Unstable angina\" which occurs at rest or is rapidly progressive (ie exercise tolerance is decreasing due to earlier onset of angina) Limiting angina that is refractory to medical therapy  13 19 \\n  High risk stress test findings. These include any of the following: o Duke score < -10 o Marked reduction in exercise tolerance with limiting signs and/or o symptoms of ischemia Imaging evidence of a large ischemic territory and/or a fall in EF with exercise o Fall in blood pressure below baseline with exercise o Heart failure or significant ventricular arrhythmias with exercise An algorithm for the management of stable angina is provided in Figure 13-19. Figure 13-19: Algorithm for treatment of stable angina. Depending on the coronary anatomy, including the number of diseased vessels, disease severity, and lesion location, coronary revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass (CABG) is considered. PCI (Figure 13-20) is the treatment of choice for patients with one or two-vessel disease without left main disease. For patients with diabetes and multivessel disease, clinical trial results have shown better outcomes with CABG surgery (Figure 13-21). 20  13 \\n Figure 13-20: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). Under x-ray guidance, a catheter is threaded through an artery to the aorta, and then advanced to the coronary artery lesion. There, a balloon is used to open the coronary artery (balloon angioplasty) and restore blood flow, followed by placement of a stent (a mesh-like metal tube that holds open the artery) to maintain blood flow through the diseased area. Ref: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention. JAMA.2004;291(6):778. Figure 13-21: Coronary Artery Bypass Graft. In CABG surgery, another artery or vein is sewn into place so that blood flow can bypass the coronary artery. If more than one artery is blocked, more blood vessels will be used to bypass them (called double, triple, or quadruple bypass surgery). Ref: Coronary-Artery Bypass Grafting.

They encompass a spectrum of myocardial injury from unstable angina (UA), to non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), to ST- segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). At the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Describe the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes. Define the three types of acute coronary syndromes (UA, NSTEMI, and STEMI) on the basis of clinical presentation, 12-lead ECG changes, myocardial enzyme elevation, and coronary artery patency. Describe the initial evaluation and management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with an emphasis on medical therapy, risk stratification for NSTEMI, and reperfusion for STEMI.  Describe secondary prevention strategies for patients with clinical coronary heart disease. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES As discussed in Chapter 13, once coronary expansion is exhausted, gradual lumen narrowing (ie stenosis) can lead to reduced coronary blood flow. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) occur in association with acute lumen narrowing or complete obstruction, most commonly the result of: Plaque disruption and thrombus formation Intra-plaque hemorrhage without plaque or endothelial disruption, resulting in acute plaque expansion and lumen narrowing Endothelial cell erosion with thrombus formation but no plaque disruption These types of lesions are illustrated in Figure 14-1. Plaque Disruption and Stenosis Certain coronary plaques are more vulnerable to disruption than others. Characteristics associated with plaque disruption (Figure 14-2) include: A thin fibrous cap overlying a large necrotic lipid core The presence of inflammatory cells (foam cells and T-lymphocytes) in the fibrous cap Neo-vessels within the plaque  14 1 \\n Figure 14-1: Pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes. The anterior surface of the heart (left) with an atherosclerotic plaque at a typical location in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. The cross-sectional and longitudinal views of the artery depict details of the lesion types, shown at the level of the plaque. The top panel illustrates plaque disruption and thrombus formation. The middle panel shows lumen narrowing from plaque expansion. The bottom panel shows endothelial cell erosion without plaque disruption, and subsequent thrombus formation. (N Engl J Med. 2013 May 23;368(21):2004-13). 2  14 \\n Figure 14-2: Characteristics of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. (J Am Coll Cardiol. 2011 May 17;57(20):1961-79) Inflammatory cells destabilize plaques by producing several types of proteases including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). These molecules can degrade extracellular matrix and weaken the fibrous cap, contributing to plaque rupture. Disruption of the fibrous cap exposes the arterial lumen to the plaque core, which is rich in procoagulant tissue factor. Endothelial cell dysfunction, the result of atherosclerosis, also contributes to a prothrombotic state favoring thrombus (ie blood clot) formation over degradation. Thus, a partial or fully occlusive thrombus can develop in association with plaque disruption. \"High-risk\" or vulnerable plaques often demonstrate expansive remodeling and only minimal or mild lumen narrowing. Patients with this type of plaque are often asymptomatic before ACS occurs. Thus, acute coronary syndrome can be their first manifestation of coronary heart disease. Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are the result of an acute, high-grade obstruction (80% or greater) of one or more epicardial coronary arteries. Resting coronary flow is compromised, and ischemia at rest develops. Embolization of plaque contents or thrombus can also contribute to downstream ischemia and infarction by occluding the microvasculature. Triggers of ACS Plaque rupture appears to be \"triggered\" in many cases by emotional stress or physical exertion. Emotional stress and physical exertion raise heart rate and blood pressure, resulting in hemodynamic stress that presumably contributes to plaque rupture. Those at greatest risk of an exertion-related ACS appear to be sedentary adults participating in vigorous activity. As for emotional stress, studies demonstrate an association between ACS and earthquakes, extreme excitement,  14 3 \\nand anger. There is also a circadian variation in the development of ACS, with a spike in events during the first several hours after awakening from sleep. Myocardial Infarction The degree of stenosis and duration of myocardial ischemia determine the consequences for the myocardium. Based on animal studies, irreversible myocardial necrosis or infarction occurs after 20 to 40 minutes of continuous ischemia. Thus, a very brief period of ischemia should not result in irreversible myocardial injury (ie infarction). However, there can be transient impairment of systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation caused by depletion of ATP.At the other extreme, a prolonged episode of severe ischemia is highly likely to cause tissue infarction and some degree of irreversible contractile dysfunction. If infarction does occur, several enzymes (troponin I, troponin T, myoglobin, the MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase [CK-MB], and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) are released from necrotic myocardial cells. If these enzyme levels exceed a defined threshold, typically the 99th percentile for a normal population, a diagnosis of myocardial infarction can be made. Although myoglobin provides the earliest detection of myocardial necrosis, it is nonspecific as it can be elevated in association with skeletal muscle injury. LDH is also nonspecific for the myocardium because it is present in the liver and skeletal muscle. Likewise, while CK-MB is found in the heart, it is also found in other tissues including skeletal muscle. The troponin I and troponin T are cardiac specific isoenzymes and therefore more specific for myocardial infarction. For this reason, a troponin level is used for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Figure 14-3 shows the time course of troponin I release. Notably, even a modest troponin level elevation is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Figure 14-3: Plasma concentrations of cardiac enzymes after myocardial Infarction. (Pathophysiology of Heart Disease, Lilly et al. 6th Edition) 4  14 \\n ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) encompass a spectrum of myocardial injury from unstable angina (UA), to non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), to ST-segment myocardial infarction (STEMI). The duration and extent of reduced coronary blood flow determines the degree of symptoms, signs, and myocardial injury. Although ACS is most often due to an acute change in a coronary atherosclerotic plaque, it is important to consider other etiologies of ACS.These include: Ascending aortic dissection with involvement of the coronary ostia Coronary emboli (thrombus, valve vegetation) Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) (occurs more frequently in women, is also a complication of percutaneous coronary intervention) Vasculitis (eg Takayasu arteritis) Coronary trauma Coronary vasospasm (etiologies include cocaine use) Congenital coronary anomalies These should be suspected for patients without coronary heart disease risk factors or for a young patient with ACS symptoms. Clinical Presentation Symptoms at presentation of ACS are often those typical of stable angina. Specifically, chest discomfort or pressure that is retrosternal in location. It may be associated with diaphoresis, dyspnea, or nausea. However, these symptoms differ from stable angina in that they occur at rest or are rapidly progressive. The degree of symptoms is often more severe, and the duration of symptoms is longer. The angina may also come and go as the result of thrombus growth and lysis. \"Atypical\" symptoms of ACS include dyspnea, nausea, weakness, or syncope. Up to 25% of patients with ACS present with atypical symptoms, particularly women, older patients, and patients with diabetes. In up to 20% of cases, patients with ACS do not present for medical evaluation because symptoms are mild or absent. In this case, a myocardial infarction may be diagnosed later on the basis of an abnormal ECG with pathologic Q waves. In up to 33% of cases, out-of-hospital sudden cardiac death secondary to ventricular arrhythmias may be the clinical presentation. Diagnosis The type of ACS is determined by the degree of coronary occlusion and of subsequent myocardial injury (Figure 14-4). STEMI occurs with a fully occlusive thrombus, which manifests as ST-elevation on an ECG.Cardiac enzymes are always elevated.  14 5 \\n Figure 14-4: Diagnosis of ACS UA and NSTEMI most often occur with a partially occlusive thrombus or rapid expansion of a coronary plaque without thrombus formation. Full vessel occlusion is less common (5%), and the extent and degree of ischemia is less than seen with STEMI.By definition, the ECG does not show ST-segment elevation. However, it may show ST-segment depression, T wave abnormalities, or no changes at all. If there is no myocardial infarction, troponin levels will be normal, and the diagnosis is UA.If troponin levels are elevated, the diagnosis is NSTEMI.STEMI is nearly always the result of a fully occluded vessel. Troponin levels will be elevated, indicating myocardial infarction, and the ST segment on ECG is elevated. One caveat to the ECG findings is that If full vessel occlusion occurs 6  14 \\n and is transient, posterior in location, or involves a small territory or a territory with collateral blood supply, the ECG may not show ST-segment elevation. In this case, the patient is classified as having an NSTEMI.The following sections outline the management of each type of ACS.UNSTABLE ANGINA Unstable angina (UA) is an increase in ischemic symptoms. While stable angina is predictable, occurring with exertion, unstable angina in unpredictable, presenting as one of the following: 1. Exertional angina that is rapidly progressive (increasing in frequency, duration, or intensity) without rest pain. 2. Angina that occurs at rest In these cases, without prompt treatment, UA could progress further in the spectrum of ACS to NSTEMI or STEMI.Management The management of UA is the same as for NSTEMI and will be discussed in the next section. NON-ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (NSTEMI) Management The three cornerstones of management are 1. Anti-thrombotic therapy 2. Anti-anginal therapy 3. Risk stratification to determine if the patient should undergo revascularization. Antithrombotic therapy includes administration of anti-platelet drugs and anticoagulant drugs. The purpose is to inhibit the platelet aggregation and thrombus formation that develop following plaque rupture and/or endothelial disruption. This will prevent further vessel occlusion. For anti-platelet therapy, aspirin is started immediately. Although the addition of thienopyridine therapy (ie clopidogrel) carries a risk of excess bleeding in the small number of patients who will require CABG surgery, the ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend its use at presentation for medium and high-risk patients with UA and NSTEMI.The combination of aspirin and clopidogrel is known as dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT). For anticoagulant therapy, IV or subcutaneous heparin should be given to all but the lowest risk patients. Thrombolytic therapy is not indicated for NSTEMI as it has not shown efficacy and carries the risk of severe bleeding (eg intracranial hemorrhage).  14 7 \\nAnti-anginal therapy is the second cornerstone of management and includes beta blockers and nitrates. Beta-blockers are used to decrease myocardial oxygen demand, but are avoided for patients with bradycardia, low blood pressure, or decompensated heart failure. Nitrates are used to dilate the coronary arteries in patients with refractory angina but are avoided in cases of right ventricular infarction. This is because the right ventricle loses contractility with infarction and subsequently becomes highly preload dependent. Nitrates decrease venous return (and thus RV preload) due their vasodilatory effect on the venous system. Risk stratification is based on clinical studies that have demonstrated that some patients with NSTEMI are at higher risk than others for the development of recurrent ischemia, myocardial infarction, and death. Using risk stratification, these high-risk patients can be targeted for more aggressive therapies including dual anti-platelet therapy at presentation and early revascularization. The GRACE risk score was derived from a large registry of patients with ACS and is commonly used. It estimates mortality in-hospital, at 6 months, and 3 years. Variables for this risk score are listed in Table 14-1. Of note, you may also hear of the TIMI risk score, which is another well-established risk score that is commonly used. Grace Risk Score Variables Age Systolic blood pressure Heart rate Serum creatinine Cardiac arrest at admission Elevated cardiac enzymes ST segment deviation Killip Class - Class 1: No heart failure - Class 2: Pulmonary rales or S3 - Class 3: Pulmonary edema - Class 4: Cardiogenic shock Table 14-1 GRACE Risk Score Variables. ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend angiography and revascularization within 24 hours for patients with NSTEMI and/or a GRACE score > 140. Other patients with NSTEMI who should undergo urgent coronary angiogram and revascularization include those with any of the following: - Refractory angina despite initial medical management - Heart failure - Hemodynamic instability - Unstable arrhythmias (ie ventricular tachycardia) 8  14 \\n Patients who are not at high risk can be managed conservatively with anti- platelet and anticoagulant therapy. If they remain clinically stable, they should undergo stress testing. If the stress test suggests a low risk for recurrent ischemia or myocardial infarction, they can be discharged from the hospital on dual anti-platelet therapy for one year along with the additional medical therapy discussed below including beta-blockers and statins. If the stress test shows elevated risk, they should undergo angiography. ST-ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (STEMI) therapy therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel), anticoagulant Management The management of STEMI is similar to that of NSTEMI.It starts with anti- platelet (IV or subcutaneous heparin), and anti-anginal therapy (beta blocker and/or nitrates). Additionally, patients should receive oxygen if they are hypoxic, and morphine to reduce pain and the associated sympathetic effects that increase myocardial demand. Where management greatly differs from UA and NSTEMI is that rather than risk stratification, STEMI is considered an emergency and the patient should undergo emergent reperfusion. ACCF/AHA Guidelines recommend reperfusion for patients who have experienced ACS symptoms for less than 12 hours. This recommendation is based on studies showing that the benefit of reperfusion therapy decreases as the time from symptom onset increases. Thus, the earlier that reperfusion therapy is started, the better the outcome. In fact, if reperfusion can be performed within the first hour following symptom onset, nearly all of the myocardium can be salvaged. Options for reperfusion therapy include: 1. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 2. Thrombolytic therapy 3. or Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Percutaneous coronary intervention (Figure 13-18), if performed in a timely fashion, is the preferred reperfusion strategy for STEMI.During the procedure, the coronary arteries are viewed under fluoroscopy using a small amount of contrast (angiography). If a stenosis is found, a catheter is then inserted under fluoroscopy imaging toward the site of coronary occlusion. A balloon at the end of the catheter is inflated, compressing the thrombus and plaque (balloon angioplasty). Often, a stent is subsequently inserted to prevent elastic recoil of the artery and reduce re-stenosis at the site. PCI has been shown to restore normal coronary blood flow over 90% of patients. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated less morbidity and mortality in the short term (ie myocardial infarct size) and long term (ie death, stroke, or reinfarction at six months) with PCI as compared to thrombolytic therapy. Moreover, in a randomized clinical trial, 30-day mortality for patients with STEMI was 3.4% with PCI compared to 6.2% with thrombolytic therapy.  14 9 \\nIn order to restore as much myocardium as possible, the goal time from initial presentation to PCI (\"door-to-balloon time\") is within 90 minutes. However, only 39% of hospitals in the US have PCI capability. For this reason, transfer to a PCI capable hospital is favored over thrombolytic therapy if the patient can undergo PCI within 120 minutes of the initial presentation. Thus, if a substantial delay is anticipated before PCI can be performed, thrombolytic therapy should be given. At the time of PCI, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (ie epitifibatide) can be used during catheterization for patients in whom a large thrombus burden is visualized. However, their use is infrequent given the associated high bleeding risk. Also, IV bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is sometimes substituted for heparin during PCI, as studies have demonstrated a lower bleeding risk and better outcomes with this drug. Thrombolytic therapy (also known as fibrinolytic therapy) utilizes plasminogen activators to activate plasmin, lyse the thrombus, and restore coronary blood flow. Commonly used agents include alteplase and streptokinase. The goal time from initial presentation to thrombolysis (\"door-to-needle time\") is within 30 minutes. Angiographic studies have demonstrated restoration of normal coronary blood flow in up to 50-60% of patients at 90 minutes following the initiation of IV thrombolytic therapy. If partial restoration of blood flow is also included, restoration of flow is closer to 70-80%. If thrombolytic therapy is chosen, patients should still receive heparin, aspirin and clopidogrel (a thienopyridines (prasugrel and ticagrelor) have not been studied with thrombolytic therapy, and therefore should not be used. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with a small risk of intracranial hemorrhage (1.5%). COMPLICATIONS OF ACS thienopyridine). The other Factors associated with a higher risk of complications and mortality include: Initial presentation with tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm) or hypotension (SBP<100 mm Hg). This is because hemodynamic instability is associated with a larger area of infarction. Infarction of the anterior/septal wall (left anterior descending artery territory)   History of prior MI, heart failure, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. Complications of myocardial infarction are shown in Figure 14-5. These include heart failure, embolism, cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, tamponade, and pericarditis. Necrosis of the myocardial wall from infarction leads to impaired wall motion and subsequent heart failure from the loss of contractility and thus, decrease in ejection fraction. Patients with a low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (<40%) after MI are at higher risk of mortality and life-threatening arrhythmias. It is therefore standard practice post-MI to measure the ejection fraction using echocardiography. 10  14 \\n Stasis of blood can occur in regions of impaired LV contraction, particularly if the apex of the LV (left anterior descending artery territory) is involved. Stasis can lead to thrombus formation. This thrombus may embolize (ie travel) into the systemic circulation, resulting in stroke (by occlusion of a cerebral artery) or other end-organ damage. Hence, for patients with impaired LV contraction leading to stasis, anticoagulation is recommended for the prevention of embolism. Left ventricular infarction resulting in heart failure can progress to cardiogenic shock. Patients with cardiogenic shock have a very poor prognosis despite aggressive reperfusion therapy (mortality 40-50%). Right ventricular (RV) infarction can result in hypotension. Intravenous fluid resuscitation will increase RV preload and usually correct this complication, although large amounts of fluid may be required. Figure 14-5: Complications of myocardial infarction. Ref: Pathophysiology of Heart Disease, Lilly. 6th Ed. Wolters Kluwer. Arrhythmias are common complications of MI and include ventricular fibrillation, atrial fibrillation, AV block, and bradycardia. Ischemia and infarction of the AV node and His-Purkinje system can lead to high-grade AV block requiring temporary or permanent pacing. Sinus bradycardia is especially common with right coronary artery occlusion and inferior myocardial infarction. The mechanical complications of myocardial infarction include papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septum rupture, and free wall rupture. Papillary muscle rupture will result in acute, severe mitral regurgitation and heart failure. Rupture of the ventricular septum with formation of a ventricular septal defect will result  14 11 \\nin a left to right shunt and acute volume overload of the left ventricle (this will be explained further in Chapter 15). Most of these patients will develop heart failure and possibly cardiogenic shock. Free wall rupture and acute bleeding into the pericardial space can cause cardiac tamponade and subsequent shock. Despite surgical intervention, patients with mechanical complications have a very high mortality. Finally, inflammation of the pericardium adjacent to the infarcted myocardium is a relatively common complication. Less commonly, pericarditis can occur days to weeks post-MI, the result of an immune response against damaged myocardium, and is often accompanied by fever and pleuritic chest pain. This constellation of symptoms is called Dressler Syndrome. SECONDARY PREVENTION For patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD), multiple interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of future coronary events. Table 14-2 summarizes recommendations for patients with CHD both after myocardial infarction, and for those with no history of myocardial infarction. Aspirin at low dose (81 to 162 mg per day) should be given to all patients with CHD indefinitely. Clopidogrel or another thienopyridine is indicated as part of medical therapy post-MI for those patients who did not receive coronary revascularization and should be continued at least 12 months following NSTEMI or STEMI.Warfarin therapy should be considered for up to 6 months following antero-apical myocardial infarction if the LV apex is severely hypokinetic (contracting poorly) or akinetic (not contracting) or a thrombus is present. Cholesterol-lowering therapy should be started as soon as possible. Trials of cholesterol-lowering therapies have shown a 1% reduction in clinical events for every 1% the LDL cholesterol is lowered! Statins will lower LDL cholesterol by 25-50% at approved doses. Based on the 2013 AHA/ACC Cholesterol Guidelines, patients with known CHD should be treated with high doses of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Beta-blockers should be given to all patients who survive a myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) for at least three years, unless contraindicated by reactive airway disease or bradycardia. ACE inhibitors have been shown to lower mortality post-MI, and to lower the risk of stroke, MI, and death in patients with any atherosclerotic vascular disease. ACE inhibitors are absolutely indicated in patients with history of MI and reduced LV systolic function (EF < 45%) or heart failure. Secondary preventative medical therapy is summarized in Table 14-2. 12  14 \\n History of CHD No history of MI Post-MI Medication Low dose Aspirin Thienopyridine Yes Yes, if a stent was placed. Yes Yes Yes Lipid-lowering therapy (ie statin) Yes Beta-blocker ACE-inhibitor As needed for angina or heart failure For hypertension; consider in all patients Yes, at least 3 years Yes Table 14-2: Medical therapies known to reduce the risk of mortality and/or future coronary events in patients with known CHD.In addition to medical therapy, lifestyle modification is very important. A Mediterranean diet rich in fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and monounsaturated plant oils has been shown to reduce clinical events after myocardial infarction. Exercise has several beneficial effects, and 30-60 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity is recommended at least 5 days per week. Patients who smoke should be encouraged to quit and referred to a smoking cessation program. Weight maintenance or reduction should be encouraged to maintain or achieve a BMI of ≤25 kg/m2. Finally, control of diabetes (HbA1C ≤ 7%) and systolic blood pressure (< 130-140 mm Hg) are also important goals. FUTURE RESEARCH - SEX DIFFERENCES IN ACS In a study of over 690 thousand hospitalizations for ACS, mortality was significantly higher for women versus men (PMID: 30470725). Improving ACS outcomes for women requires better understanding of biological sex differences and gender bias in medical care. One biological difference is the higher prevalence of MINOCA (myocardial infarction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease) in females. MINOCA is a syndrome where a patient presents with all the signs and symptoms of NSTEMI or STEMI, but on angiography has no significant stenosis (<50%) in any major epicardial vessel. Patients with MINOCA are more likely to be female, younger, or non-white, and have fewer cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension (PMID: 21081748). The current emphasis on diagnosis and treatment of ACS by PCI is based on decades of research on the primarily male pattern of atherosclerosis: focal plaques. As a result, patients with MINOCA are at risk of being inappropriately untreated for their ischemia. MINOCA is an umbrella diagnosis of myocardial ischemia with no clinically overt cause. Potential mechanisms including coronary vasospasm, embolism, spontaneous coronary artery dissection, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Additional studies are required to better understand the etiology of MINOCA and why the sex difference exists. Currently, the Women\\'s Heart Attack Research  14 13 \\nProgram (HARP) is enrolling patients with MINOCA across the US to improve the diagnosis and treatment of this syndrome. Study aims include evaluating the use of cardiac MRI in the diagnostic algorithm of ACS (NCT02905357). The results will help physicians make better treatment and prevention choices for their patients, with the goal of closing the mortality gap for women with myocardial infarction.

After introducing these lesions, we will delve into the physiology of shunts and ductal dependent lesions, review identification of congenital heart murmurs, and learn how to counsel patients with congenital heart disease. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to: Describe the clinical symptoms, signs and treatment of: o Shunt lesions: atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. o Complex lesions: coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, and transposition of the great arteries Describe how the physiology of tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of the great arteries makes them cyanotic lesions. Describe the etiology of Eisenmenger syndrome and which shunt lesions are at risk. Explain what a ductal dependent lesion is and when to treat it empirically. Discuss the long-term consequences of the above isolated lesions. Determine when to refer a patient for suspected congenital heart disease. WHY LEARN THIS? Congenital defects are common. In fact, they affect the heart more than any other organ system. Moreover, they affect approximately 1% of live births and cause 30% of infant mortality in the United States. This is an important topic for all physicians to know because: It is not just a problem of pediatrics o Due to the successes of pediatric cardiology and pediatric heart surgery, more than 90% of children born with congenital heart disease survive to adulthood. As a result, there are more than 1,000,000 adults with congenital heart disease alive today. In fact, there are more adults than children with congenital heart disease in the U.S.  Primary care physicians are the first line of defense in congenital heart disease. Often the early, treatable stages are asymptomatic. Although most patients with congenital heart disease have murmurs, most children with murmurs do not have congenital heart disease. The majority of congenital heart defects are treatable, and most patients lead full and active lives. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE With modern obstetric ultrasound, approximately 40% of serious congenital heart disease is detected prenatally, and another portion is picked up by newborn oximetry screening. Most remaining patients are detected due to symptoms (something the patient observes) or signs (something the doctor observes). Signs that are associated with congenital heart disease include heart murmurs, other abnormal heart sounds, cyanosis, or pulmonary rales. Of these, the most common sign suggesting  15 1 \\ncongenital heart disease is a murmur. A murmur is the sound of blood flow in the heart. Most congenital heart defects result in murmurs, but most murmurs are not associated with congenital heart disease. This seeming paradox is easily explained. Approximately 1% of infants who are born alive have a congenital heart defect, but at least 40% of us will have a heart murmur at one time or another in our lives. Even if every patient with a congenital heart defect had a murmur, those with murmurs and normal hearts would vastly outnumber those with congenital heart defects and murmurs. For this reason, it is important to distinguish the different types of murmurs to the extent possible in order to limit the need for otherwise unnecessary tests. The symptoms of congenital heart disease usually include dyspnea, decreased exercise tolerance, and more rarely chest pain, edema, syncope, or in infants, difficulty feeding. Most congenital defects are \"isolated lesions.\" That is, there is only one abnormality, with subsequent physiological changes. This makes understanding the pathology and pathophysiology much easier. We can apply much of what we have learned previously about valvular heart disease to congenital heart disease. SHUNT LESIONS Shunt lesions, or holes, are what most people think of first in connection with congenital heart disease. The shunt lesions occur at one or more of three levels: the atrial level, the ventricular level, or the arterial level (Table 15-1). Shunt Lesions Atrial Septal Defect Ventricular Septal Defect Patent Ductus Arteriosus Table 15-1: The three levels of shunt lesion locations. Atrial Septal Defects Atrial septal defects (ASD) are present in ~1/1,500 live births and can occur in various locations in the atrial septum. The reason for this has to do with the embryology as discussed in your HFF reading on fetal cardiac development and circulation. The most common type of ASD is the ostium secundum ASD (also called a secundum ASD) which is located in the center of the interatrial septum. If there is no other defect, the atrial septal defect will result in flow from the left atrium to the right atrium, since the pressure in the left atrium is usually higher than the right. This, in turn, will lead to excess volume in the right ventricle and increased flow into the pulmonary circulation. This is illustrated in the middle panel of Figure 15-1. 2  15 \\n Figure 15-1: Atrial septal defect. This figure shows an ostium secundum atrial septal defect. In most patients, the flow is left-to-right causing volume overload to the right atrium (RA), right ventricle (RV), and pulmonary arteries (PA). LA = Left atrium, LV= Left ventricle, and Ao = Aorta. In the case of an atrial septal defect, pulmonary blood flow is now greater than aortic blood flow by an amount equal to the left-to-right shunt through the atrial septal defect. As a result, all structures which are subjected to (ie loaded with) this extra flow will be affected. In this case, the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary circulation, and left atrium are all affected. In fact, right atrial and right ventricular dilation are typical in all forms of atrial septal defect. Left atrial dilation is not pronounced since there is release of the volume overload into the more compliant right atrium. The left ventricle may be relatively small because it is under-filled. In addition to chamber enlargement, another sign of an atrial septal defect is a murmur due to increased flow through the pulmonic valve. However, this murmur is very similar to normal flow through the pulmonary valve and can therefore be difficult to distinguish. Fortunately, there is another sign that can be helpful, which is splitting of the second heart sound, S2. S2 is composed of the sounds of aortic valve closure, A2, and pulmonic valve closure, P2. Normally the pulmonic component of S2 varies in its timing during respiration due to the changes in venous return to the right side of the heart. These changes in venous return are related to changes in intrathoracic pressure that occur during breathing. Specifically, during inspiration there is negative intrathoracic pressure and therefore increased venous return to the heart. Conversely, during expiration there is positive intrathoracic pressure and therefore decreased venous return to the heart. This change in venous return results in an increase in the time between A2 and P2 during inspiration, and a decrease in the time during expiration. This variability is called physiologic splitting. In an atrial septal defect, the volume load on the right side of the heart is increased to the point that the pulmonic component is always delayed, resulting in fixed splitting of the S2.  15 3 \\n Figure 15-2: The second heart sound in a normal heart versus an ASD.The majority of patients with an atrial septal defect do not have any symptoms. The defect is usually picked up either due to the murmur, or an enlarged heart on an imaging study. Even though the patients may have reduced exercise tolerance, they may not be aware of it since it has been present throughout their life. Thus, they do not have a \"normal\" baseline for comparison. Patients may report that they have \"never been a great runner.\" Unrepaired atrial septal defects result in progressive right heart enlargement, dilation of the right atrium, atrial arrhythmias, and ultimately right ventricular dysfunction. In approximately 10% of patients, high blood flow through the lungs leads to pulmonary arteriole damage, resulting in permanent elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance, and subsequent reversal of the shunt to right-to-left. This condition is called Eisenmenger syndrome and means that direct repair of the heart defect is no longer possible since the pulmonary vasculature is permanently damaged. This concept is discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Treatment of an atrial septal defect consists of closure. Historically this was done surgically, but now the majority of secundum ASDs can be closed with a percutaneous closure device. Ventricular Septal Defects Ventricular septal defects (VSDs) are quite common, occurring in up to 1/300 live births. Just as with an uncomplicated ASD, the flow in a simple VSD is from left-to-right since the pressure in the left ventricle is normally much higher than in the right ventricle. Because the pressure gradient is so much higher in a VSD, the murmur tends to be loud and of a higher frequency. Even though the flow through a VSD is left-to-right, unlike ASDs, VSDs do not result in dilation of the right side of the heart. Rather, VSDs cause dilation of the left side of the heart. This is because in order to dilate a chamber, it must fill with extra blood during its filling phase rather than its ejection phase. In an ASD the right ventricle fills with \"extra\" blood during diastole, subsequently dilating it. However, in a VSD, the blood is ejected across the VSD (left-to-right), through the right ventricle, and directly into the pulmonary artery. Thus, the right ventricle never \"sees\" the extra 4  15 \\n blood during diastole. The excess blood enters the pulmonary arteries (over-circulating them), then drains through the pulmonary veins into the left atrium (dilating the left atrium), and then into the left ventricle during diastole (dilating the left ventricle), prior to being ejected through the VSD into the pulmonary artery (Figure 15-3). Figure 15-3: Ventricular septal defect. Unlike ASDs, in a VSD the pulmonary arteries, left atrium, and left ventricle receive excess filling so that the left heart becomes dilated. With large VSDs, there is significantly increased blood flow to the lungs, resulting in high pressures that can cause long-term damage and subsequent Eisenmenger syndrome. For this reason, large VSDs should be closed within the first two years of life. An additional risk is that, if the VSD is near a valve (usually aortic or tricuspid), the valve leaflets can become involved, causing valve dysfunction. Small ventricular septal defects without a large shunt may not need to be repaired, and many will close spontaneously. If the shunt ratio (the proportion of blood flow going to the pulmonary circulation (Q𝑝̇ ) relative to the proportion of flow going to the systemic circulation (Q𝑠̇ ), known as the Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ , is larger than 1.4:1, then closure is often needed because otherwise the LV will dilate. Larger defects should be repaired if possible. This is usually done surgically but depending on the size and location of the defect, percutaneous closure is possible. Shunt ratios will be further discussed later in this chapter. Patent Ductus Arteriosus Our third shunt lesion is a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). This is actually not a congenital defect, since all of us had a ductus arteriosus at birth. Rather, it is a developmental defect, since the ductus arteriosus failed to close after birth. PDAs occur in less than 1/2,500 term births, but are much more common in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. There are two typical presentations of a PDA.In the first, if the flow through the ductus is large, the infant may present with respiratory distress due to pulmonary volume overload. This is similar in physiology to a ventricular septal defect and will also result in dilation the left atrium and left ventricle. For an infant in respiratory distress, it can often be difficult determine the relative  15 5 \\ncontributions of the respiratory distress syndrome of prematurity from the volume overload due to the patent ductus arteriosus. The second typical presentation of a PDA is an asymptomatic murmur in childhood. The murmur of a ductus is typically continuous and is often described as \"machine-like.\" Complications of an unrepaired PDA are similar to other shunt lesions. The increased pulmonary flow can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome. The disturbed flow can also increase the risk of endocarditis. In the newborn, shortly after birth, the mechanism which holds the ductus arteriosus open is mediated by prostaglandin E1. Thus, one treatment for a PDA in the newborn period is a prostaglandin inhibitor such as indomethacin. Figure 15-4: Patent Ductus Arteriosus. Similar to VSD, the pulmonary arteries, left atrium, and left ventricle receive excess filling, resulting in left heart dilation. 6  15 \\n COMPLEX CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE LESIONS Complex lesions are those with more severe hemodynamic and/or life-long consequences. While there are many, this section will review three: coarctation of the aorta, tetralogy of Fallot, and transposition of the great arteries. Coarctation of the Aorta Figure 15-5: Coarctation of the aorta. in the arms than in the legs. Note that the blood pressure is higher The key physical findings of a coarctation include right upper extremity hypertension, a posterior murmur, diminished femoral pulses, and a radio-femoral pulse delay - that is, the femoral pulse occurs later than the radial pulse when palpated simultaneously. Newborns with severe coarctation can present with heart failure due to increased afterload when the ductus arteriosus closes. More commonly, older children and adults present with hypertension, which is often difficult to control. There is a strong association between coarctation and bicuspid aortic valve: 5% of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve have coarctation, and >50% of patients with coarctation have a bicuspid valve. There is a common genetic predisposition, and the NOTCH-1 gene mutation has been found in some of these patients. Familial recurrence is common. Secondary effects of coarctation are hypertrophy of the left ventricle due to the increased pressure/afterload, and development of increased arterial collateral circulation though the intercostal arteries. When coarctation is detected, it should be treated promptly. Neonatal surgery is often recommended. This is because the longer the coarctation remains untreated, the higher the probability that the patient will develop heart failure or hypertension later in life. In babies, the treatment is surgical (usually excision of the coarcted segment and an end-to-end anastomosis). In older children and adults, the coarctation can be treated with balloon angioplasty and stents. Long-term complications include re-coarctation, upper extremity hypertension (even if there is not a re-coarctation - this is due to stiffening of the proximal arteries), aneurysm at the site of the  15 7 \\nrepair, and problems associated with associated cardiac defects that occur in as many as 50% of patients with coarctation. Tetralogy of Fallot Before delving into tetralogy of Fallot, we should first discuss what determines the direction of blood flow in a shunt lesion. Blood moves from a higher-pressure chamber to a lower-pressure chamber. In most cases this is left-to-right, which means that for most shunts, oxygenated blood mixes with deoxygenated blood and the patient is not cyanotic. However, if the pressures are higher on the right side than the left side, the shunt will be right-to-left. This means that deoxygenated blood moves from the right to the left side of the heart and is subsequently pumped into the systemic circulation. The resulting systemic desaturation can be measured, but it also may be visible as a bluish discoloration of the skin, also known as cyanosis. Right-to-left shunts of any type carry another risk. The lungs normally perform an important filtering function: removing microemboli of thrombus and bacteria from the blood. If there is a right- to-left shunt, these microemboli bypass the lungs and can land in the systemic circulation, where they can cause problems such as stroke or cerebral abscess. But what determines the pressure within a chamber? Because blood must flow from the atria to the ventricles and then get pumped from the ventricles to the great arteries, the pressure within a chamber is determined by the properties of the downstream receiving chamber. For example, in patients without a shunt, the left atrial pressure is determined by the diastolic filling property (the compliance) of the left ventricle. The systolic pressure in the left ventricle is determined by the combined resistance of the aortic valve and the resistance of the systemic vasculature. Thus, in patients with an ASD, blood will shunt left-to-right as long as the compliance of the right ventricle is higher than the compliance of the left ventricle (assuming negligible resistance from the mitral and tricuspid valves). In patients with a VSD, blood will shunt left-to-right as long as the pulmonary vascular resistance is lower than the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (assuming negligible resistance from the aortic and pulmonic valves). If a VSD remains unrepaired and pulmonary vascular resistance becomes higher than systemic vascular resistance, then the shunt will reverse and blood will flow right-to-left; this is Eisenmenger syndrome. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart defect; it occurs in ~5/10,000 live births. Tetralogy of Fallot is a combination of four abnormalities that stem from abnormal division of the truncus arteriosus. These four abnormalities are listed in Table 15-2. In contrast to a simple ventricular septal defect, because of the additional lesion of pulmonic stenosis, the predominant shunt in most patients with tetralogy of Fallot is right-to-left. This is because the combined resistance of the pulmonary valve stenosis and the pulmonary vascular resistance is higher than the systemic vascular resistance. In simple terms, it is \"harder\" to pump blood across the stenotic pulmonary valve and through the lungs than it is to pump blood through the systemic circulation. This means that deoxygenated blood is sent to the systemic circulation, resulting in cyanosis. 8  15 \\n Tetralogy of Fallot 1. Pulmonic Stenosis 2. Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (boot-shaped heart on CXR) 3. Overriding Aorta (aortic annulus displaced so it overrides the ventricular septum) 4. Ventricular Septal Defect Table 15-2: The Four Abnormalities of Tetralogy of Fallot. For this reason, tetralogy of Fallot is a \"cyanotic lesion.\" That is, a congenital heart lesion that sends deoxygenated blood to the systemic circulation. Figure 15-6: Tetralogy of Fallot: Native and Repaired. The left panel shows unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot. The middle panel shows the physiology of tetralogy of Fallot, including right- to-left shunting across the VSD due to pulmonic stenosis. The right panel shows a transannular patch repair. Note the VSD patch and the patch on the front of the pulmonary artery that was used to enlarge the pulmonary outflow and relieve the pulmonic stenosis. In addition to having a murmur, and often cyanosis, children with tetralogy of Fallot usually have decreased exercise tolerance. This is due to the decreased oxygen in their blood and the inability to significantly increase pulmonary blood flow due to the pulmonic stenosis. A special symptom which patients with unrepaired tetralogy of Fallot may have is \"cyanotic spells.\" These occur with exertion or crying, which lead to a drop in SVR.This reduction in SVR results in increased shunting from right to left, and subsequently increased cyanosis. This can lead to a vicious cycle, which can lead to syncope, seizures, or even death. Classically, the toddler\\'s innate response is to squat, which increases SVR and reduces the rate of right-to-left shunting. In the  15 9 \\nmodern era, tetralogy of Fallot is repaired early in life (before children are old enough to squat), so this is mostly of historical interest. Treatment of tetralogy of Fallot requires surgical repair. For babies with critical pulmonic stenosis and inadequate pulmonary blood flow, an additional shunt is surgically created to divert blood from the systemic to the pulmonary circulation; a Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt. Physiologically, this shunt is identical to a patent ductus arteriosus and is beneficial in congenital heart malformations when there is otherwise inadequate pulmonary blood flow. When the baby is large enough for complete surgical repair (typically 1 year old) the heart is opened, the VSD is closed with a patch, and the pulmonic stenosis is relieved by resecting the muscle bundles in the right ventricular outflow tract and sometimes by cutting through the stenotic pulmonic valve. Because the valve is often damaged during the repair, the most common long-term complication is pulmonic regurgitation with right ventricular enlargement. All patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot require lifelong follow-up. If the pulmonic valve was replaced, the majority will require another pulmonic valve replacement before middle-age. Arrhythmias are also common, most frequently atrial flutter or ventricular tachycardia. Historical Note In 1945, the study of shunt creation for tetralogy of Fallot was published by Alfred Blalock and Helen Taussig. This publication ushered in an era of cardiac surgical intervention, and the field of pediatric cardiology rose to prominence as a subspecialty in pediatrics. Yet, this was also a time when the Johns Hopkins Hospital had racially segregated wards, and women were rarely appointed to medical school faculty. While this study became a model for bench to bedside translational research, it also became a catalyst to address historical injustices in medicine because the authors did not acknowledge a key individual in the work, Vivien Thomas. Thomas was an African American man and Blalock\\'s surgical laboratory technician, who helped develop the subclavian-to-pulmonary anastomosis in their animal laboratory. His role was of such vital importance that he attended the early operations, standing behind Blalock in the operating room. Decades later, Thomas\\' role was depicted in the movie Something the Lord Made and the PBS documentary Partners of the Heart. He was ultimately recognized by Johns Hopkins, first by the commission of a portrait that is displayed near his mentor Blalock, and later by the awarding of an honorary doctoral degree. Today one of the four advisory colleges for medical students at Johns Hopkins is named for Thomas, and the story of his role in this surgery is shared with every entering class. (Ref JAMA.2008;300(3):328-330) Transposition of the Great Arteries In transposition of the great arteries, there is a switch between the aorta and pulmonary artery. The aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle (Figure 15-7). In this abnormality, the systemic and pulmonic circulations are parallel, with no connection between them. Thus, this is a cyanotic lesion. Transposition of the great arteries occurs in ~40/100,000 births. It does not cause any problem during fetal development since the lesion is compensated by large connections through the foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus. However, problems occur after birth when these structures begin to close. For infants with an ASD or large patent foramen ovale, there can be enough mixing in the atria to provide a sufficient amount of oxygenated blood to reach the aorta and allow the infant to survive. Prostoglandin E1 can be used to help the ductus arteriosus stay open. However, if there is no 10  15 \\n ASD or VSD, one must be created to stabilize the infant long enough to perform surgical repair. To do this, a catheter is threaded through the inferior vena cava to the right atrium and across the foramen ovale. A balloon is inflated at the tip of the catheter (which is now in the left atrium) and the catheter is pulled forcefully through the atrial septum (back to the right atrium) to tear a large hole in the atrial septum and allow for mixing. The baby will still be quite cyanotic, but there will be enough mixing to allow some oxygenated blood to reach the aorta. Figure 15-7: Transposition of the Great Arteries. The left panel shows transposition of the great arteries. The middle panel shows the old repair of an atrial switch procedure (performed until 1989), consisting of venous redirection surgery. The left panel shows the current repair of an arterial switch procedure. Definitive treatment of transposition of the great arteries requires surgery. This involves switching the great arteries to achieve a more normal circulation (this is the operation done in the modern era) or redirecting flow in the atria to switch the function of the ventricles (this is the operation which was performed until 1989). In patients you may encounter who underwent an atrial switch procedure, the right ventricle pumps to the aorta and the left ventricle pumps to the pulmonary circulation. This predisposes patients to progressive right ventricular failure since the anatomy of the right ventricle is not optimized to pump against the high systemic pressure. CARDIAC SHUNTS: PHYSIOLOGY & COMPLICATIONS Shunt Quantification To assess severity, the amount of flow that crosses the shunt can be quantified in a shunt ratio. We start by calculating flow, similar to Fick cardiac output, for both the systemic and pulmonary circulations: Q𝑝̇ = V O2 (CpvO2 - CpaO2) Q𝑠̇ = V O2 (CaO2 - CvO2) / / where Q𝑠̇ is blood flow through the systemic circulatory system Q𝑝̇ is blood flow through the pulmonary circulatory system V O2 is the rate of oxygen consumption  15 11 \\nC represents content a refers to arterial v refers to mixed venous pv refers to pulmonary venous pa refers to pulmonary arterial. The ratio of flow through the pulmonary versus the systemic circulation simplifies to: Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ = (CaO2 - CvO2) (CpvO2 - CpaO2) . / Using oxygen saturation (SO2) as a surrogate measure, the ratio becomes: Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ = (SaO2 - SvO2) (SpvO2 - SpaO2) . / Although you do not need to know how to calculate the shunt ratio (Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ ), it is helpful to be familiar with the concept. Specifically: For cyanotic lesions, Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ < 1.0 (deoxygenated blood is shunted away from the lungs) For other lesions, Q𝑝̇ : Q𝑠̇ > 1.0. (oxygenated blood is shunted toward the lungs) Complications of Shunts The presence of a shunt has physiologic consequences that can lead to clinical complications. These complications are directly related to the direction and magnitude of the shunt. The primary change we expect to see with shunt lesions is chamber enlargement, due to extra end-diastolic volume. A simple rule to determine which chambers are affected in the case of a particular congenital defect is:   Isolated lesions prior to the atrioventricular valves (ie ASD) cause right-sided chamber dilation Isolated lesions after the atrioventricular valves (ie VSD and PDA) cause left-sided chamber dilation. This means that any type of ASD, without additional defects, will result in right ventricular and right atrial enlargement. In the case of a moderate VSD, the extra flow travels through the left atrium and left ventricle, only passing through the right ventricle during systole, and therefore not causing right ventricular dilatation. However, left atrial dilation and left ventricular dilatation are prominent in this condition and dilation of the pulmonary artery can occur. Why do we care about shunts? The reason is that they lead to predictable complications, depending on the type and direction of the shunt. With left-to-right shunts, decreased efficiency of cardiac function can lead to decreased exercise tolerance, and even heart failure. Increased blood flow to the lungs can lead to damage of the arterioles over the long term, resulting in elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance (pulmonary hypertension) due to scarring of the pulmonary arterioles. Increased PVR results in reversal of the shunt to right-to-left. Recall that the direction of the shunt in a VSD is determined by the ratio of PVR to SVR.Normally, SVR is ~10 times larger than PVR.However, with progressive scarring of the pulmonary vasculature, PVR becomes higher than SVR.This condition is called Eisenmenger syndrome. 12  15 \\n Eisenmenger syndrome is the shift from a left-to-right shunt (acyanotic lesion) to a right-to-left shunt (cyanotic lesion), resulting in cyanosis. One of the major reasons for early repair of asymptomatic ASDs and VSDs with large shunts is to prevent Eisenmenger syndrome, which shortens lifespan by approximately 40 years. Once Eisenmenger syndrome develops, it is too late to correct the patent ductus arteriosus, ASD, or VSD that caused it because the elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is permanent. For right-to-left shunts, there will be systemically low oxygen saturation. This will lead to decreased exercise tolerance and a compensatory increase in the concentration of red blood cells (erythrocytosis) to carry oxygen. Erythrocytosis can increase the viscosity of the blood, leading to \"sludging\" in the small vessels and resulting in tissue infarction. In addition, the right-to-left shunt allows microemboli to bypass filtration through the lungs, potentially leading to stroke or cerebral abscess. Left to Right Shunt Right to Left Shunt Decreased exercise tolerance Decreased exercise tolerance Heart failure Endocarditis Systemic emboli Erythrocytosis and hyperviscosity Eisenmenger syndrome (from pulmonary hypertension) Table 15-3: Complications of shunts by direction. DUCTAL DEPENDENT LESIONS Some congenital heart lesions cause little problem for the fetus since there are shunts between the systemic and pulmonary circulation. However, if these lesions are ductal dependent lesions, they can cause profound cyanosis or cardiovascular collapse in the first days of life when the ductus arteriosus closes. In this scenario, because the muscular ductus arteriosus is sensitive to prostaglandin, infusion of prostaglandin E1 is used to prevent ductal closure until surgical repair can be arranged, thereby stabilizing the patient. Ductal dependent lesions can be classified into three categories (Table 15-4): 1. Severe obstruction of flow on the systemic side, 2. Severe obstruction of flow on the pulmonic side, or 3. Lack of other connections between the pulmonic and systemic circulations. For left-sided obstructive lesions (such as coarctation), a right-to-left shunt occurs across the PDA.This causes deoxygenated blood to enter the systemic circulation. However, as the saying goes, \\'blue blood is better than no blood,\\' so the ductus helps to maintain some circulation. For right-sided lesions (such as tetralogy of Fallot), a left-to-right shunt occurs across the PDA.This allows additional blood to go to the lungs, bypassing the right-sided defect (Figure 15-8). As a result, more oxygenated blood can be sent to the systemic circulation. If the PDA closes, blood  15 13 \\nflow to the lungs will decrease, resulting in more deoxygenated blood sent to the systemic circulation and subsequent cyanosis. Finally, in the category of \"lack of other connections\" (such as transposition of the great arteries), patients have parallel pulmonary and systemic circulations and therefore depend upon the PDA for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. With ductal closure in the absence of an adequate atrial or ventricular septal defect, profound cyanosis ensues. Category Example Severe obstruction of systemic flow (left sided obstruction) Severe aortic stenosis Mitral atresia Severe coarctation Severe obstruction of pulmonic flow (right sided obstruction) Tetralogy of Fallot Tricuspid atresia Severe pulmonic stenosis Lack of other connections Transposition of the Great Arteries Table 15-4: Ductal dependent lesions. Figure 15-8: Patent ductus arteriosus prior to closure and its contribution to tetralogy of Fallot. Blue is deoxygenated blood, red is oxygenated blood, and purple is mixed blood. In response to the right ventricle\\'s decreased ability to pump blood through the stenotic pulmonic valve, the PDA sends blood to the lungs, thus allowing for greater oxygenation. 14  15 \\n MURMURS IN CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE Differentiating among murmurs depends on timing, intensity, pitch, shape, location, and radiation. Additionally, the murmur\\'s response to certain maneuvers can be helpful. Some simple rules of thumb for differentiating pathological from normal variant murmurs (also known as \"function murmurs\" or \"physiological murmurs\") are: Diastolic and continuous murmurs (ie heard through systole and diastole) are usually pathological. Murmurs that are > grade 3 in intensity, or radiate are usually pathological.   Murmurs that change with respiration are likely right-sided murmurs. \"Harsh\" sounding murmurs are almost always pathological. Common murmurs that are normal variants are listed in Table 15-5, and the most common pathological murmurs that are due to congenital heart disease are listed in Table 15-6.

Patients and their parents may not ask these questions, even though they are concerned, because they fear the answer. For example, many assume that the presence of congenital heart disease means they will require surgery and have a shortened lifespan. A significant number of simple congenital heart defects resolve spontaneously before adulthood, and some are so mild that they never require operation. However, some people with simple congenital heart defects and most people with more complex defects will require at least one surgery during their lifetime. In the past, the recommendation for children with congenital heart disease was to avoid all physical activity. This contributed to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle in many teenagers and adults, putting them at higher risk of other cardiovascular disease later in life. As knowledge in the field of congenital heart disease grew, it was recognized that the risk of exercise was overstated. Now, it is recommended that the majority of patients with congenital heart disease participate in regular physical exercise. Depending on the lesion, however, high intensity competitive sports may not be suitable. Mood disturbances are common in congenital heart disease. Anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder may affect up to one-third to half of patients. This may be related to prior surgeries or hospitalizations, or the impact of living with congenital heart disease on the person\\'s social development. However, these disorders can also be seen in patients who never faced these challenges. It is therefore important to include assessment for these conditions in general medical care. Many wonder if their condition is inherited. The majority of congenital heart diseases does not involve known genetic syndromes. Overall, if a parent has congenital heart disease there is a ~5% chance that their child will also have congenital heart disease. The probability of transmission increases if there are multiple family members with congenital heart disease. The risk of transmission is higher in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve which, in many cases, is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance. Finally, some patients with congenital heart disease may have difficulty obtaining health insurance. This issue was partially addressed when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law in 2010, with changes taking effect in 2014. Specifically, for plans purchased after March 23, 2010: Health insurance plans cannot deny coverage nor charge more for people with pre-existing conditions such as congenital heart disease. People with congenital heart disease and other conditions will no longer face annual or lifetime dollar caps on covered services. The ACA also includes Congenital Heart Disease Specific Funding. This includes directives to the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to improve research and data collection across the increased lifespan of people with congenital heart disease. 16  15 \\n COMMON CLINICAL SCENARIOS We can now apply the information we have learned to two common clinical scenarios that you are likely to see in primary care. Here we will examine a newborn requiring urgent transportation and a child who is not growing normally. 1. Newborn needing transport You are at a medical center that does not have pediatric cardiology support, and there is a newborn who needs transport to another center for more definitive diagnosis and care. What you can do to stabilize and improve the chances for the newborn? Specifically, should you give prostaglandin E1 during transport? For the neonate with ductal dependent congenital heart disease, administration of prostaglandin E1 can result in a prompt reversal of the hemodynamic abnormalities, whether they are in shock or severely cyanotic. This can allow for safer transport and better overall outcome. The problems where prostaglandin E1 should be considered are primarily profound cyanosis, shock, acidosis, and respiratory distress. Using these criteria, it should be possible to identify those who would benefit from prostaglandin E1 administration. Prostaglandin E1 is generally well tolerated, but it is not without uncommon complications such as hypotension and apnea. The most problematic group is the sickest neonates since there is some overlap in presentation (ie cause of shock). While the benefit of prostaglandin E1 is potentially highest in this group, the risk is also greatest. In such cases, cautious administration of prostaglandin E1 and monitoring for the response is likely the best course. 2. Failure to thrive (grow) One of the major tasks for children is growing. If they are not growing as expected, we should be suspicious that something is wrong. Congenital heart disease can cause \"failure to thrive,\" and the mechanism is slightly variable in different age groups. The key is to realize that the mechanisms include cyanosis, heart failure, and limitations of cardiac output. In the newborn, this often presents with fussiness, sweating, and crying when feeding. On physical exam, we would check an oxygen saturation, look for cyanosis, auscultate for a murmur, and evaluate pulses. We would look for signs of heart failure on history and exam. We would also get a chest X-ray to look for cardiomegaly. If all of these are normal, then it is unlikely that congenital heart disease is the cause of the failure to thrive.  15 17 \\nAPPENDIX The details of congenital heart disease naming conventions and physiology can be confusing, especially when going into more detail than what was presented above. The material presented in this appendix is not required for this course. The information that appears in this appendix will not be on the exam, but it is presented for those of you who are particularly interested. Atrial Septal Defects The various possible locations of ASDs are noted in Figure 15A-1. Note that these ASDs are not all present at the same time. Figure 15A-1: Location of various types of ASD.After the secundum ASD, the next most common ASD is the ostium primum ASD (also called a primum ASD) which is located adjacent to the annulus of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Although we think of an atrial septal defects as isolated defects, the primum ASD is usually associated with additional abnormalities such as VSD or an abnormal mitral valve. The reason is related to the development of the endocardial cushion, as noted in the chapter on fetal cardiac development and circulation. The third most common type of atrial septal defect is the sinus venosus defect, which is usually close to the superior vena cava. This defect is associated with abnormal drainage of the right superior pulmonary vein into the SVC and leads to large left-to-right shunts. The rarest form of atrial septal defect is an opening of the roof of the coronary sinus, which is the venous return of the circulation of the heart, running along the posterior mitral annulus. Ventricular Septal Defects Most types of VSDs go by multiple names, which can cause confusion. Table 15A-1 lists the major types of VSDs, along with their synonyms. The most common type of VSD is the perimembranous VSD, or a membranous VSD (also called the infracristal VSD because it is just below the ridge of tissue called the crista ventricularis). There is a type of VSD that is associated with endocardial cushion defects (like a primum ASD) and is both adjacent to and involves the mitral and tricuspid valves. This is called a muscular VSD, or an inlet VSD.18  15 \\n A relatively rare form of VSD occurs just under both the pulmonic and aortic valves, above the ridge of tissue in the right ventricular outflow tract called the crista supraventricularis. This is called the supracristal VSD.Finally, malalignment of the great vessels as they exit the heart, such as in tetralogy of Fallot, is called a malalignment VSD.Figure 15A-2: Location of various types of VSD.Table 15A-1: Types of VSDs Non-restrictive Defects Non-restrictive defects are large defects that allow a significant amount of blood to flow between chambers. Since there is free flow of blood, there will be no significant pressure difference between the chambers. Thus, we cannot use the pressure difference to determine the predominant direction of shunt. Instead, as a result of this pressure equalization, there is bidirectional shunting. Specifically, in diastole, the predominant direction of the shunt is toward the ventricle with the highest compliance (ie the least stiff ventricle). In systole, the predominant direction of the shunt is toward the ventricle emptying into the lowest resistance. For example, during systole with a large VSD, anything that increases resistance to flow out of the right ventricle (ie pulmonary hypertension, pulmonic valve stenosis, etc) would reduce or even reverse the left-to-right shunt. As a general rule, this results in predominant directions of shunting that are in the same direction as would happen with restrictive defects. An atrial level left-to-right shunt will be reduced or reversed by anything which impedes emptying the right atrium. This would include right ventricular hypertrophy or severe dilatation, both of which reduce compliance, and tricuspid stenosis.  15 19 Ventricular Septal Defects Infracristal VSD Membranous, perimembranous, subaortic Supracristal VSD Subpulmonic Muscular VSD Trabecular, inlet Atrioventricular Septal Defect Endocardial cushion defect, atrioventricular canal Malalignment VSD\\n 20  15 \\nChapter 16 Peripheral Vascular Disease Authors: Matthew Sweet, MD, and Ted Kohler, MD INTRODUCTION At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Describe the evaluation and treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and a ruptured AAA.the prevalence, Discuss factors, symptoms, natural history, classification, and treatment of peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) risk Describe the appropriate medical therapy for patients with PAOD Describe the symptoms and signs of chronic limb threatening ischemia (CTLI) and of acute ischemia Describe the pathophysiology of stroke due to carotid artery disease Describe the prevalence, etiology, clinical significance, and treatment options for venous insufficiency. PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE Peripheral vascular disease is a broad term encompassing a variety of diseases of the arteries and veins, excluding the coronary circulation and intracranial circulation (Table 16-1) Blockage of flow Blood going where it should not be Arterial Disease 1. Atherosclerosis 2. Embolization 1. Ruptured Aneurysm 2. Injury (iatrogenic or trauma) 3. Dissection Venous Disease 1. Venous thrombosis 2. Venous compression 1. Venous insufficiency 2. Injury (iatrogenic or trauma Table 16-1: A framework for peripheral vascular disease The arteries and the veins can be thought of as conduits for blood to move from the heart which serves as a pump to the lungs and then to the periphery to deliver oxygenated blood, nutrients, and immune cells to protect against infection and heal injury. The arterial system is a high pressure, elastic system with pulsatile flow. The venous system is a low-pressure system with unidirectional valves to prevent back-flow. Several types of pathological processes happen in the peripheral vascular system. These processes can be broken down into two types of problems: a lack of flow (due to blockage) or leakage of blood (due to injury or vessel rupture). These two problems can be further broken down into pathologic processes of the arterial system or of the venous system. Note that each system has different anatomy, physiology and pathophysiology.  16 1 \\n Arteries can develop atherosclerosis leading to reduction in blood flow or plaque rupture with thrombosis or embolization. This can cause chronic and/or acute ischemia in the legs, intestine, and brain (stroke). Arteries can also degenerate and weaken, resulting in dilation and aneurysm formation. Aneurysms can be harmful by rupturing (causing bleeding), by forming thrombus within them that can embolize, or by compression of adjacent structures, usually veins and nerves, and result in symptoms from this. Another less common form of arterial pathology is dissection, in which the intima of the vessel wall tears and blood tracks into the media. Arteries can also have vasculitis (auto-immune and toxic), traumatic injury, congenital abnormalities and infectious pathology. These less common issues are beyond the scope of this text. Venous pathology is somewhat different than arterial pathology. Venous pathology consists mostly of thrombosis (acute vschronic) and insufficiency (also known as reflux). Venous thrombosis is a common problem that all physicians will encounter. In the acute setting, it can cause pain, swelling, and embolization (eg pulmonary embolus). Chronic venous thrombosis results in damage to the vein wall with valve dysfunction and chronic leg swelling and pain. Venous insufficiency is one of the most common medical problems in the western world, affecting somewhere around 20% of adults. This is usually an inherited tendency for the superficial venous system valves to fail, resulting in leg swelling, pain, and varicose veins. In severe cases, it can lead to chronic skin damage and ulceration. In this section, we will discuss: Arterial Pathology Venous Pathology 1. Superficial venous insufficiency 2. Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism 1. Aneurysm disease 2. Aortic dissection 3. Peripheral artery occlusive disease - Chronic Ischemia - Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) - Acute ischemia 4. Carotid artery disease Vascular Surgery is a specialty that is dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of the above conditions. We utilize open surgical techniques as well as endovascular techniques to treat arterial and venous pathology. Vascular surgeons also create hemodialysis access, treat traumatic injury, and assist other surgeons in the management of non-vascular pathology that involves major vascular structures (ie tumors involving the blood vessels). Vascular surgeons also interpret vascular ultrasound studies, a field of medicine developed here at the University of Washington. 2  16 \\nANEURYSM DISEASE The normal adult aorta is about 3 centimeters in diameter at the aortic root and narrows slightly as it descends to its bifurcation into the common iliac arteries. The most life-threatening diseases of the aorta are caused by processes that weaken the wall and cause it to become aneurysmal (dilated). Aneurysm is defined as a vessel widening by > 50% of the adjacent normal diameter. A true aneurysm is a widening of the blood vessel itself, and thus involves all layers: intima, media, and adventitia. A pseudoaneurysm, or false aneurysm, does not involve all layers. These usually result from a leak out of the artery into a surrounding hematoma resulting in a pulsating mass, indistinguishable from a true aneurysm on physical examination. The intima and media are always disrupted; sometimes the adventitia remains intact, containing the bleeding. The most commonly encountered pseudoaneurysms are those that form in the common femoral artery at catheter puncture sites if the artery continues to bleed after the catheter is removed. Following blunt trauma, such as sudden deceleration injury in motor vehicle accidents, the thoracic aorta can tear where it is tethered by the ligamentum arteriosum, just beyond the subclavian takeoff (Figure 16-1). Figure 16-1: A traumatic aortic tear. Note the widening of the first part of the descending aorta (blue arrow). Pathophysiology The etiologies of an aneurysm include primary wall degeneration due to inflammation (similar to what occurs in atherosclerosis), collagen vascular disorders, dissection, infection, and vasculitis. The most common cause of peripheral arterial aneurysms was thought to be atherosclerosis, but there are  16 3 \\nmany differences between aneurysmal degeneration of the arterial wall and occlusive atherosclerosis. Both share many risk factors, such as smoking, hypertension and male gender. In aneurysm disease, the wall thins and loses elastin and collagen, becoming stiffer and more fragile. There is a heritable component to this process, suggesting a genetic abnormality of matrix metabolism. Aneurysms caused by collagen vascular disorders (eg Marfan and Ehlers Danlos) tend to occur in younger patients and involve the thoracic aorta more commonly than the abdominal aorta. These aneurysms occur due to genetic mutations that result in dysregulation of TGF-beta. This causes degeneration and weakening of the artery wall. Infection can involve the arterial wall, particularly in atherosclerotic plaques. Such mycotic aneurysms may result after an episode of bacteremia following dental work, cholecystitis (associated with Salmonella), or other infections. Prior to the development of penicillin, syphilis was a common cause of thoracic mycotic aneurysm. Aneurysms are asymptomatic until complications develop. Rarely, they may compress adjacent structures, usually nerves or veins, causing pain, numbness, weakness, or venous congestion. This is more commonly seen in peripheral artery aneurysms, such as popliteal artery aneurysms. Aneurysm sacs are typically lined with thrombus that forms long the wall where flow is relatively stagnant. For this reason, arteriograms, which only demonstrate flowing blood in the vessel lumen can look completely normal in an aneurysmal segment of artery. Wall thrombus can break off and embolize. Embolization is the process where a loose clot is pushed by the blood flow distally in the artery until it gets to a narrower part of the artery where it lodges and blocks flow. This causes acute ischemia in the more distal vasculature. This is an uncommon event with abdominal aortic aneurysms, but is the primary cause of morbidity in patients with popliteal aneurysms, which are located at the knee and subject to frequent flexion and extension. Popliteal aneurysms rarely rupture, and when they do there is no threat to life since massive bleeding cannot occur in the popliteal space. However, limb loss due to embolism is very common with popliteal aneurysms and is the reason that these aneurysms should be treated. Diagnosis It is best to diagnose aneurysms before they become symptomatic since the first symptom may lead to loss of life or limb. Physical examination should always include palpation of the abdomen and popliteal spaces for pulsatile masses. In thin persons, a prominent aortic pulse may be confused with an aneurysm. This may also occur in elderly patients whose aortas may be elongated and tortuous. Since abdominal aneurysms can erode into the spine, patients may present with back pain. Lumbar spine x-rays in these patients may show the outline of the enlarged and calcified aortic wall. Ultrasound is the screening tool of choice because it is accurate, noninvasive, and relatively inexpensive. Screening ultrasound is covered for Medicare enrollees who have a 4  16 \\nhistory of tobacco exposure or a family history of AAA.Detailed anatomic information is required to plan endovascular aneurysm repair (repair with stent grafts); currently computerized tomography scanning is the best method of obtaining this. Because AAA and popliteal aneurysms often occur in the same individuals, patients with either aneurysm should have ultrasound screening to rule out aneurysms in the other location. Method Findings Symptoms Abdominal pain, back pain Signs Hypotension, pulsatile mass Imaging Lumbar spine x-rays Ultrasound (best for screening) CT Scan (more detail) MRI *Not arteriography Table 16-2: Diagnosis of Aneurysms Treatment Because the aortic wall continues to thin as it enlarges, and wall stress increases with increasing diameter (by the law of LaPlace), risk of rupture increases as aneurysms expand. Surgical repair is urgent in patients with leaking or ruptured aneurysms. This group may present with the classic triad of abdominal pain, hypotension, and a palpable, pulsatile abdominal mass and should be taken immediately to the operating room. Impending rupture is suggested by the sudden onset of back or abdominal tenderness or tenderness on palpation of the aneurysm and should prompt consideration of immediate repair. In general, elective surgical repair is indicated when aortic aneurysms exceed 5.5 cm in diameter in males (sex) and 5 cm in females (sex). Females should be treated at a smaller aneurysm size (5.0 cm) because they have a higher mortality than males for the same size aneurysm, possibly because their arteries are smaller in general. Thus, the same size aneurysm represents a relatively greater enlargement in females than in males. Standard, open repair is being replaced with the less invasive endovascular technique, which carries lower initial morbidity, but the long-term results may not be as durable since endoluminal devices are not sutured in place and may change configuration and leak over time.  16 5 \\nFigure 16-2 Risk of rupture increases with abdominal aortic aneurysm size. AORTIC DIssECTION Dissection occurs when blood enters the aortic wall through a tear in the intima and forms a false lumen within the media that can impinge on the true lumen causing stenosis or total occlusion. The dissection may start anywhere along the aorta, but most commonly begins beyond the arch vessels, and tends to spiral down into the iliac vessels. The most common cause is hypertension. The driving force pushing blood into the wall is the rising pressure gradient between the wall and the lumen as the pressure wave passes through the aorta. Thus, treatment is aimed at reducing hypertension with vasodilators, such as nitroprusside, and the pressure gradient with beta-antagonists. Dissection is also commonly associated with collagen vascular disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, that cause weakening of the wall. Figure 16-3: Abdominal aortic dissection 6  16 \\nSymptoms Symptoms of aortic dissection include acute onset of tearing back pain and symptoms associated with occlusion of branch vessels. When patients with acute aortic dissection present in the emergency setting, they are often presumptively diagnosed with a myocardial infarction due to the nature of their symptoms. When the troponins and EKG are normal, they are then evaluated with CT scan which establishes the diagnosis. Involvement of carotid arteries could lead to stroke, of renal arteries to acute renal failure or exacerbation of hypertension, of superior mesenteric and celiac arteries to mesenteric ischemia, and of iliac and acute lower extremity arteries to limb ischemia. Occlusion of the subclavian arteries causes decreased upper extremity blood pressure, which may confound the underlying diagnosis of hypertension. Dissection of the ascending aorta is an immediate threat to life due to widening of the aortic root, which causes acute aortic insufficiency and occlusion of coronary arteries subsequently causing acute myocardial ischemia. Alternatively, dissection of the aorta could lead to dissection into the pericardium, resulting in pericardial tamponade. Treatment Treatment of aortic dissection is based on the anatomic location and degree of ischemia. In all cases, patients need continuous monitoring and rapid control of blood pressure in an intensive care unit. Intervention is required for dissections involving the ascending aorta and arch (Type A), due to their acute life- threatening nature. This is done by cardiothoracic surgeons and carries a high mortality rate. Medical therapy (control of hypertension) is used for dissections beyond the arch (Type B). Surgical treatment is used when medication fails to halt symptoms or there are ischemic complications from branch occlusions. Treatment may require surgical replacement of a segment of the aorta (and sometimes of the aortic valve), closing off the entry point of the dissection with a covered stent, puncture of the false lumen to allow re-entry into the true lumen (so called fenestration, done angiographically), or bypass from uninvolved arteries to vessels whose origin has been occluded by the dissection. Figure 16-4: CT scan image showing an acute aortic dissection. The yellow arrow points to the intima which has separated from the media, creating a \"double-barrelled\" aortic flow channel.  16 7 \\nPERIPHERAL ARTERY OCCLUSIVE DISEASE Peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD) can lead to inadequate blood flow, resulting in ischemia. This may occur suddenly (acute ischemia), or in the case of slowly progressive occlusive disease, chronically (chronic ischemia, or chronic limb threatening ischemia). Chronic Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease Chronic PAOD includes (1) chronic ischemia and (2) chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). In chronic ischemia, there is a chronic reduction of flow to the lower extremities. Patients usually present with claudication (also referred to as intermittent claudication), which a muscular ache or cramp in the calf, thigh, or buttock, that is consistently brought on by walking a specific distance. The pain is worse, or may be brought on earlier, with activities like walking uphill, carrying heavy objects, or climbing stairs since the lower extremity muscles must work harder. The major muscle group affected is that below the level of occlusion (ie the calf for superficial femoral artery stenosis, the thigh for external iliac and common femoral stenosis, and buttock for aortic or common iliac stenosis). Intermittent claudication is relieved by a brief period of rest in the standing position. This walk-pain-rest-relief cycle is repeated over and over. Vascular claudication is highly reproducible as it occurs whenever a specific workload (oxygen demand) of the muscles is reached. For example, symptoms may occur every time a patient walks the same distance on flat ground, The natural history of intermittent claudication is benign in terms of limb loss. However, the presence of PAOD is a marker for coronary heart disease. Consequently, at 10 years, while a patient with PAOD has a good rate of limb survival, they have a low rate of patient survival. Intermittent Claudication 5 years 10 years Limb survival Patient survival 93% 73% 88% 39% Table 16-3: Survival rates for Intermittent Claudication Patients with diabetes often have distal artery disease (sparing the aortoiliac system and instead involving distal tibial and digital vessels) and medial calcification. They often present with ulceration due to neuropathy caused by insufficient perfusion. These wounds often fail to heal, also due to insufficient perfusion. 8  16 \\nChronic ischemia of the aortoiliac system is known as \"aortoiliac occlusive disease\" or \"Leriche Syndrome.\" These patients present with four characteristics: (1) high claudication (ie thigh and buttock claudication), (2) impotence, (3) decreased femoral pulses, (4) lower extremity muscle atrophy. It is important to be aware of a mimic of arterial claudication: pseudoclaudication (also referred to as neurogenic claudication). Pseudoclaudication is caused by compression of nerves roots in the lumbar spine due to lumbosacral disk disease. It differs from arterial claudication in that it can vary throughout the day (worse in the morning) and from day to day. Patients must usually rest for a prolonged period (up to 30 minutes) to recover and their walking distance decreases when they resume walking. Notably, symptoms of pseudoclaudication are relieved when the patient leans forward (ie leaning on a shopping cart). This is because when standing erect, the lumbar canal is narrowed, reducing the interlaminar space. When the patient leans forward, this space increases, relieving pressure on the nerves. Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia (CLTI) represents a more advanced stage of chronic ischemia. It characterized by rest pain. Rest pain occurs when blood flow to the extremity is so low that nerves and peripheral tissues cannot obtain sufficient oxygen to meet their baseline metabolic demands. The pain (or numbness) is consistently in the distal foot, typically occurring at night, exacerbated by elevation, and relieved by dependency (hanging the leg over the side of the bed so gravity helps with blood flow to the distal foot). Rest pain is often confused with nocturnal leg cramps, which are in the calf muscle and are episodic. In contrast, ischemic rest pain is continuous and felt in the toes and metatarsal heads. This distinction is important because rest pain indicates a threatened limb and requires urgent attention. Chronic ischemia of PAOD is graded by the Rutherford classification (Table 16-4). The discrimination between claudication (Rutherford Class 1-3) and CLTI (Rutherford Class 4-6) is of paramount importance. Claudication tends to have a chronically stable natural history. CLTI portends an acute threat to both the limb and to the patient\\'s overall wellbeing.  16 9 \\n n o i t a c i d u a C l I L T C 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Rutherford Classification Asymptomatic Mild claudication (ie walking 0.5 miles) Moderate claudication (ie walking 1 block) Severe, short distance claudication (ie walking across a room) Ischemic pain at rest Minor tissue loss (the limb is potentially salvageable with revascularization) Major tissue loss (the limb is no longer salvageable, even with revascularization. Amputation is the only treatment option). Table 16-4: The Rutherford Classification Diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease The diagnosis of PAOD can be made by a careful history and physical examination. History should include the pattern of pain and the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis (smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, family history of premature atherosclerosis) and other manifestations of atherosclerosis (coronary heart disease or stroke). The physical exam may reveal signs of inadequate perfusion, such as hair loss of the distal leg and foot, thickened nails (since they grow slowly), and ulceration. Turbulent flow distal to a stenosis can manifest as bruits over downstream vessels on auscultation. When arterial disease causes CLTI, the foot becomes pale when held above the level of the heart when the patient is supine (elevation pallor) and erythematous when allowed to hang below the level of the heart (dependent rubor) due to stagnant blood pooling in chronically dilated arterioles. Peripheral pulses are not palpable with significant PAOD.Assessment of the femoral pulse is important, as it can help discriminate between occlusive disease of the aorto-iliac segment vsthe infra-inguinal arteries (superficial femoral artery (SFA), popliteal, and tibial). Testing is usually only confirmatory but can be helpful with doubt still exists after the history and physical regarding the diagnosis. The severity of PAOD is determined by the ankle-brachial index (ABI). The ABI is performed by measuring the blood pressures at the ankle and at the arm when the patient is supine. The ankle pressure is taken where the dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulse is palpable. The arm pressure is taken at the brachial artery. Blood pressures are taken bilaterally, with the higher value for the arms and the higher value for the ankles used in the calculation of the ABI.10  16 \\n - An ABI of 0.90 to 1.20 is normal - An ABI of < 0.90 is diagnostic of PAOD - An ABI of < 0.40 suggests severe PAOD - An ABI of >1.40 suggests non-compressible vessels, usually due to calcification, and the results are thus not interpretable. Note that the normal range of an ABI indicates that the ankle pressure is close to equal, if not greater than, the arm pressure. This is because in the legs, vessel walls thicken while keeping the inner radius unchanged. The wall thickening is due to higher intraluminal pressures that result from the increased hydrostatic pressure in the lower extremities when standing. Claudication may occur with ABI\\'s that are normal at rest because a lesion that is not hemodynamically significant under resting conditions may become significant when flow is increased by exercise. For this reason, ankle pressures are measured before and after exercise (e.g., treadmill testing in the vascular lab). Diagnosis of Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease History Claudication (pain with exercise, worse with increasing intensity of activity, relieved with rest) Physical Exam Diminished or absent pulse, bruits, limb pallor, dependent rubor, atrophic skin, hair loss, thickened nails, ulceration, or gangrene. Testing - Ankle-brachial index (ABI) - If planning a procedure, consider duplex ultrasound, CTA, MRA, or Angiogram Table 16-5: Diagnosis of peripheral artery occlusive disease. Treatment of Peripheral Artery Occlusive Disease The first line of treatment for claudication (Rutherford Class 1-3) is risk factor modification. This includes smoking cessation, medical therapy (aspirin, statin, and blood pressure control), and exercise. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, vasodilator, and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, can improve walking distance. Very few patients who present with claudication progress to limb loss (Table 16-3). Surgical treatment for these patients is elective and based on their degree of disability. Revascularization for patients with disabling claudication who have effectively controlled their risk factors. Most patients will not require revascularization and can be managed medically. In contrast, for patients with CLTI (Rutherford Class 4-6), revascularization is urgent. Revascularization may be accomplished by endovascular treatment (balloon angioplasty or stenting) or surgical procedures such as endarterectomy is reserved only  16 11 \\nor bypass using prosthetic grafts for large arteries (aorta, iliac, and above-the-knee femoral), or veins (preferred for below-the-knee bypasses). Acute Ischemia An acute decrease in blood flow is usually caused by embolism, thrombotic occlusion of an atherosclerotic plaque, dissection, or traumatic disruption of a vessel. The resulting degree of ischemia depends on many factors. Most organs and extremities have multiple large arteries supplying blood flow. For example, the brain has a rich collateral circulation. Patients who have chronic arterial occlusive disease tolerate acute artery occlusions better than others because they have developed collateral circulation in response to the chronic disease. On the other hand, some tissues are supplied by end arteries (meaning they only have one artery supplying blood). Occlusion of an end artery causes total ischemia to that vessel\\'s tissue bed. An example is the renal artery, which in most cases, is the single blood supply to the kidney. Acute occlusion of this vessel is poorly tolerated, and irreversible renal ischemia occurs within minutes to hours of acute renal artery occlusion. Diagnosis ischemia presents with Acute the \"6 P\\'s\": pain, pallor, pulselessness, poikilothermia (the area is cold to the touch), paresthesias (numbness), and paralysis (Table 16-6). Patients with moderate occlusive disease may have many of these findings, but paresthesia and paralysis indicate impending tissue loss and require immediate intervention. This is because the nerve tissue is most sensitive to ischemia. Hence, revascularization is urgent if the extremity is becoming weak or loses sensation. Limbs with irreversible ischemia are cold, numb, immobile, and mottled with a bluish purple, non-blanching discoloration. The 6 P\\'s of Acute Ischemia 1. Pain 2. Pallor 3. Pulselessness 4. Poikilothermia (cold) 5. Paresthesia (numbness) 6. Paralysis (weakness) Table 16-6: The \"6 P\\'s\". Treatment Treatment is anticoagulation with heparin followed by revascularization to restore blood flow. When the extremity is numb or weak, urgent intervention is required, usually by surgical thrombectomy, embolectomy, or bypass. When ischemia is less 12  16 \\nsevere, there is time to attempt catheter-directed therapy with infusion of lytic agents such as tissue plasminogen activator to dissolve the thrombus or embolus. Revascularization can cause local and systemic complications. The local complication of compartment syndrome is due to capillary leak from reperfusion injury within muscular fascial compartments. Because tissue oxygenation and nutrition depend on capillary flow, tissue damage occurs when compartment pressures exceed capillary pressure. Early signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome include a tense area and pain on passive stretch of the muscles affected. The late findings of loss of sensation and motor weakness suggest imminent tissue loss and require urgent treatment by fasciotomy (surgical incision of the fascial compartments) to relieve pressure. Systemic complications are caused by the leakage of potassium and myoglobin from injured muscle. This results in hyperkalemia, which can cause a fatal arrhythmia such as ventricular fibrillation, and myoglobinemia, which can cause acute renal injury. Figure 16-5: Aortoiliac disease resulting in narrowing of the distal aorta and proximal iliac arteries Figure 16-6: Angiograms before (left) and after (right) left iliac angioplasty and stenting. Note that in prior to intervention, there is effectively no flow in the left iliac artery (left figure).  16 13 \\nOTHER FORMS OF PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE Buerger\\'s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans) is an inflammatory process of medium and small vessels associated with smoking. Occlusion of very distal tibial or digital arteries causes ulcers of the tips of fingers and toes and can lead to loss of digits. It is caused by smoking in susceptible patients and can be arrested by cessation of smoking. However, most patients with Buerger\\'s disease are strongly addicted to smoking and unable to quit even as they lose digits from the disease. Acute, temporary ischemia can also be caused by vasospasm (Raynaud\\'s phenomenon) which involves the digital vessels of the hands and sometimes the feet, and is usually caused by exposure to cold. The response has three phases: the involved digits are first white, due to lack of blood flow, then as flow returns they become blue due to venous congestion with desaturated blood, and finally they become hyperemic, pink, and may have throbbing pain. CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE Carotid artery disease typically occurs at the carotid bifurcation in the neck due to low and oscillating shear stress from flow in the carotid bulb. Symptoms are mostly caused by embolization from plaque rather than decreased flow from the arterial obstruction. This is because the intracerebral circulation has rich collateralization, mainly through the Circle of Willis. Carotid Artery Flow Patterns Symptoms from carotid embolization include amaurosis fugax (monocular, ipsilateral, temporary blindness from embolization through the ophthalmic artery to the retina), or focal hemispheric neurologic symptoms (contralateral numbness, weakness, or aphasia). The duration of the symptoms depends on the size of the embolus and may be nonexistent, temporary (resolving within 24 hours: a transient ischemic attack), lasting several days, or permanent (stroke). Carotid Artery Disease Symptoms Focal, hemispheric neurological deficits Contralateral numbness Contralateral weakness Aphasia Ipsilateral amaurosis fugax (monocular blindness) Table 16-8: Symptoms of carotid artery disease Symptoms of disease in the posterior circulation (vertebral and basilar arteries) are nonfocal and nonhemispheric. They are usually caused by decreased flow rather than emboli since these arteries are too small to have large plaques that can break down and embolize. Usually the anterior and posterior circulations are affected; 14  16 \\notherwise collateral flow from anterior to posterior would prevent symptoms. Thus, treatment is usually correction of the accompanying carotid disease first. Diagnosis of the degree of narrowing can be made by duplex scanning, CT angiography, or MR angiography. Duplex scanning is the most cost-effective screening examination. Multicenter randomized clinical trials have shown that patients with symptoms and >70% carotid artery stenosis benefit from carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The same group of studies showed that asymptomatic patients with >80% stenosis also benefit from CEA.Since these trials, the incidence of strokes has declined due to better medical therapy (specifically broader anti-platelet and statin therapy). This improvement in medical care has cast doubt on the benefit of surgery among asymptomatic patients. New randomized trials are ongoing to determine the role of surgery for asymptomatic patients. However, surgery is still recommended for symptomatic patients. Notably, carotid stenting is becoming a valuable alternative to endarterectomy. It is currently preferred for patients who are not good operative candidates due to unfavorable anatomy, high cardiac risk, or prior neck operations. VENOUS DISEASE The extremities have superficial and deep venous systems. The superficial veins may drain directly into the deep system, as in the case of the saphenous vein, which joins the femoral vein at the saphenofemoral junction. They also connect through a serious of perforating veins, which penetrate the superficial fascia into the deeper compartments. Veins contain one-way valves which keep blood flowing centrally from the superficial to the deep system. Veins of the leg are emptied by the calf pump. Contraction of the muscles in the leg compresses the vein and expels blood centrally due to the valves. Superficial venous insufficiency - Varicose Veins Superficial venous insufficiency occurs when the valves in the superficial venous system do not work properly and/or when patients develop varicose veins. Varicose veins are enlarged superficial veins in the lower extremity. These veins elongate as they widen, forming serpentine vessels, often in clusters. The branches of the saphenous veins (both greater and lesser) are most often afflicted. This is a benign condition, which has a heritable component, and is more frequent in gravid females. About 20% of adults in the western world have some degree of superficial venous insufficiency. The most common symptom is an aching pain over the veins, worsened by prolonged standing. The veins will occasionally thrombose and even more infrequently rupture and bleed. Treatment is generally use of compression stockings, but can include either surgical excision or ablation with various forms of catheters that use laser or radiofrequency energy to coagulate the veins.  16 15 \\nVenous Thromboembolism Superficial thrombophlebitis is a generally benign condition caused by trauma (such as the placement of intravenous catheters) or hypercoagulable conditions. Patients present with a tender, swollen, erythematous cord over the distribution of a superficial vein. Treatment is symptomatic including anti-inflammatory agents, heat, and elevation. If the vein is infected (suppurative thrombophlebitis) it should be excised. If phlebitis extends to near the groin, where the vein joins the deep venous system, anticoagulation should be considered to prevent extension into the deep venous system. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) most commonly occurs in the calf veins. Thrombosis in the veins is usually prevented by the anticoagulant effects of intact, normal epithelium. Damage to the endothelium, stasis, and a hypercoagulable state (Virchow\\'s triad) favor thrombosis. Thus, risk factors for DVT include endothelial injury or dysfunction (for example from smoking or direct trauma), immobilization (such as prolonged surgery, paralysis, bed rest, or splinting following fracture), and hypercoagulable states (heritable conditions such as antithrombin III deficiency and factor V Leiden, or hypercoagulability following trauma, pregnancy, cancer, and estrogen use). While anecdotal reports of DVT following long airplane rides are well known, the actual incidence of DVT related to travel is extremely low. In fact, it is so low that clinical studies are difficult to complete. Hydration, frequent walking, and taking aspirin are harmless, if unproven, prophylactic measures. Deep Venous Thrombosis Risk Factors Age Prior history of DVT Major surgery Inherited hypercoagulability Estrogen drugs Malignancy Acute paraplegia or prolonged immobility Table 16-9: Risk factors for DVT Unlike superficial thrombophlebitis, in which the vein is inflamed, deep vein thrombosis is not associated with inflammation and thus may be asymptomatic. Patients may present with unilateral lower extremity swelling or calf tenderness. The physical finding of pain on passive stretch of the calf muscle (Homan\\'s sign) is unreliable (50% accuracy). The gold standard for diagnosis is non-invasive duplex scanning. This method combines ultrasound imaging with pulsed Doppler. It allows measurement of velocity in visualized vessels. Thrombosis is detected 16  16 \\nby lack of flow (zero velocity) and inability to compress the vein by pressing over it with the ultrasound probe. DVT is treated with anticoagulation for three to six months, starting immediately with heparin and converting to warfarin. Alternatively, there are novel oral anticoagulants that can be used which do not require monitoring of coagulation parameters and are associated with fewer bleeding events. Longer treatment, sometimes lifelong, is required for multiple recurrent episodes, DVT in association with significant pulmonary embolism, or the presence of continued risk factors. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a consequence of the embolization of a venous thrombus into the pulmonary circulation and subsequently obstructing flow through major pulmonary artery branches. Symptoms include decreased oxygenation due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, hyperventilation, and in severe cases, hypotension due to outflow obstruction of the right ventricle. Since PE occurs in the presence of intravascular thrombosis, it is associated with an increase in d- dimer levels (d-dimer is a product of fibrin breakdown). A normal d-dimer level is a good test to rule out PE.At the same time, a positive d-dimer is nonspecific and frequently elevated other underlying conditions, including the post-operative state. The gold standard for diagnosis of PE is computerized tomography angiography, which can detect significant-sized emboli. Post-thrombotic Syndrome The post-thrombotic syndrome occurs after DVT has damaged the veins and their valves. This results in long-term chronic ambulatory venous hypertension as blood cannot drain properly. Increased capillary pressure results in exudation of protein into the interstitial space. Tissues become woody and firm, and oxygen and nutrient supply from capillaries may be inhibited by protein deposition around these nutrient vessels. The calf becomes narrowed at the ankle, giving it an hourglass appearance. Red blood cells enter the interstitial space by diapedesis out of capillaries. They deposit hemosiderin in the tissue causing hyperpigmentation. Tissue break down occurs, particularly around the medial malleolus. Venous ulcers can also occur. These are distinguished from arterial ulcers by their moist, pink appearance and location in the \"gator\" region of the leg (from the ankle to the mid- calf). Whereas arterial ulcers are dry, pale, painful, and tend to occur over pressure areas and in the toes and distal foot where blood supply is the worst and trauma is most frequent.  16 17 \\n 18  16 \\nChapter 17 Pericardial Disease Author: Karen Stout, MD INTRODUCTION At the end of this chapter you should be able to: Describe the anatomy of the pericardium. Describe the pathophysiology of the three different highlighted pericardial diseases. Distinguish the diagnostic strategies, hallmarks and pathognomonic features of each pericardial disease. Describe the treatment options for each pericardial disease. Recognize the clinical importance of pericardial tamponade and how to make the diagnosis clinically. ANATOMY The pericardium encloses the heart and proximal great vessels. Each of the great arteries are enclosed by pericardium for several centimeters after they exit the heart. The vena cavae are enclosed as they enter the right atrium. The only non-cardiac structures associated with the pericardium are the phrenic nerves, which run along the outer portion. The pericardium is composed of two layers. The visceral pericardium is a thin serous layer adherent to the epicardium. It folds back on itself superiorly and attaches to the parietal pericardium (Figure 17-1). The parietal pericardium is a fibrous layer, normally 1-2 mm thick. It has multiple ligamentous attachments to other thoracic structures including the sternum, diaphragm, and other structures in the anterior mediastinum. Collagen is the dominant component of the parietal pericardium, allowing some flexibility and stretch. When relaxed, the collagen is wavy, but when stretched, it straightens, limiting the distensibility of the pericardium. If gradually stretched over time, such as with progressive ventricular dilation, the pericardium will accordingly increase in size. There is serous fluid between the layers of the pericardium, normally less than 50 cc. Pericardial pressure ranges from -5 mm Hg to +5 mm Hg, reflecting the changes in intrathoracic pressure that occur with respiration.  17 1 \\nFigure 17-1: The pericardium enclosing the heart and proximal great vessels. Innervation is provided predominantly by the phrenic nerve. Although the pericardium is well innervated, the role of the innervation is not well understood. There are multiple pain receptors in the pericardium that play a significant role in the symptoms related to pericardial injury or inflammation. Although patients without a pericardium, either due to congenital absence or pericardiectomy, do not suffer any adverse consequences, there are several beneficial mechanical properties of a normal intact pericardium. The attachments of the parietal pericardium to other structures keep the heart in a stable position in the chest. The rubber-like properties of the parietal pericardium limit diastolic filling of the heart. Additionally, the pericardium serves as a barrier to pulmonary or other non-cardiac thoracic infections. Diseases of the pericardium include acute pericarditis, chronic pericarditis, and cardiac tamponade. Acute pericarditis is typically self-limiting, while chronic pericarditis can be debilitating, and cardiac tamponade is life threatening. PERICARDIAL DISEASES There are three pericardial diseases discussed in this syllabus: 1. Acute pericarditis (common) 2. Constrictive pericarditis (uncommon) 3. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade (life threatening) 2  17 \\nACUTE PERICARDITIS Presentation Acute pericarditis is the most common pericardial disease. It is defined as signs or symptoms of pericardial inflammation that have lasted less than 2 weeks. The etiologies are multiple, but most cases are idiopathic. In this circumstance, idiopathic refers to the lack of a clear etiology on routine testing. Although viral etiologies account for a significant number of \"idiopathic\" pericarditis, viral serology testing is not routinely performed as this is expensive and does not alter management. Patients with acute pericarditis are frequently healthy, although some may report a history of a viral illness several days to weeks prior. The typical clinical presentation of acute pericarditis is marked by fever and pleuritic chest pain (pain worse on inspiration or when coughing). Many patients report a positional change in pain. Specifically, pain improves when sitting upright or leaning forward. Associated symptoms may include shortness of breath, although this is often related to pain limiting inspiration more than actual effort related dyspnea. The classic physical exam finding of acute pericarditis is the pericardial friction rub. It is a scratchy murmur, created by the two inflamed layers of pericardium rubbing against each other. It is best heard with the bell at the left sternal border with the patient leaning forward at held exhalation. It has three components to its sound, one systolic and two diastolic. The rub may not manifest all three components and is notoriously fleeting, disappearing between exams. The electrocardiogram classically demonstrates diffuse ST elevations and PR depressions (Figure 17-2). The ST elevations are due to myocardial injury, while the PR depressions presumably represent abnormal repolarization caused by the inflamed pericardium around the atria. As opposed to myocardial infarction, the ST elevation in pericarditis is concave upward (not convex) and lacks reciprocal ST depressions. T-wave inversions develop after a return to baseline and without development of Q-waves.  17 3 \\nFigure 17-2: Acute pericarditis. Note the PR depressions and diffuse ST elevations without reciprocal depressions. Etiologies The etiologies of acute pericarditis are highly varied and result from any disease state that can cause inflammation of the pericardium, both infections and non- infectious. Infectious Acute Pericarditis Infectious causes include a variety of organisms (Table 17-1). Viral pericarditis likely accounts for many cases of idiopathic pericarditis, particularly Echovirus, Coxsackievirus, and Adenovirus. Immunocompromised patients with HIV may have pericarditis either due to HIV or other infections such as M.tuberculosis or M.avium-intracellulare. Bacterial pericarditis is uncommon, and patients tend to be profoundly ill. They often manifest consequences of disseminated infection in addition to acute pericarditis. In immunocompetent patients, bacterial pericarditis is extremely uncommon. Patients at higher risk include those with immune suppression or instrumentation of the pericardium, either due to trauma or medical procedures (surgical or percutaneous). Patients with compromised immune systems include those with malignancies or HIV, as well as treated with chemotherapies or immune suppressants. Bacterial pericarditis can develop due to endocarditis, contiguous spread of infection in neighboring tissues such as the lungs, or hematogenous spread of infection. those being 4  17 \\nAs the incidence of tuberculosis has declined in industrialized nations, so has the incidence of tuberculous pericarditis. In developing countries, it is more common. In the US, immunosuppressed patients such as those with HIV/AIDS are at higher risk. Treatment is supportive for patients with viral or idiopathic pericarditis. Anti- inflammatory medications are the mainstay, usually non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents. Some patients require more aggressive anti-inflammatory therapy such as steroids or colchicine. Occasional patients require the addition of narcotics for pain relief. For patients with bacterial pericarditis, pericardial drainage in addition to antibiotic therapy is needed. The drainage often needs to be surgical rather than percutaneous, and despite these treatments, the mortality is high. Tuberculous pericarditis can be difficult to diagnose, and often requires a pathologic sample of pericardium demonstrating Mycobacterium on staining or by culture. It is treated with aggressive antimicrobial therapy. Table 17-1: Infectious causes of acute pericarditis. Non-Infectious Acute Pericarditis Non-infectious causes of acute pericarditis include underlying medical illnesses and therapeutic agents (Table 17-2). After myocardial infarction, patients may develop either early or late pericarditis. Early pericarditis is presumably mediated by local inflammation from the infarcted tissue. Late pericarditis can occur weeks to months after the infarct and is known as Dressler\\'s syndrome. The etiology of this is not fully understood but is presumed to be an immune response elicited by healing myocardium. The  17 5 \\nincidence of pericarditis following myocardial infarction has decreased with improved techniques for revascularization of the infarct associated vessel. Acute pericarditis related to connective tissue disorders is a manifestation of the systemic inflammatory nature of such illnesses and responds to therapies directed at the systemic disorder. Pericarditis is one of the defining clinical features of systemic lupus erythematosus and may affect up to 30% of patients at some point in their illness. Drug induced acute pericarditis is associated with a variety of agents, most commonly procainamide and hydralazine. The pericarditis abates with discontinuation of the offending agent. Neoplastic diseases can result in acute pericarditis due to secondary spread of malignancy. Primary malignancies of the pericardium are extremely rare, and typically cause chronic, rather than acute, pericarditis. Acute pericarditis related to malignancy is typically due to metastasis of other tumors. Tumors most commonly associated with acute pericarditis included lung, breast, lymphoma and leukemia. Treatment of the underlying malignancy will often improve the pericarditis, but this may be difficult with metastatic disease and the therapy is typically palliative. These conditions are often associated with pericardial effusions and can result in cardiac tamponade. Radiation therapy can be associated with acute and chronic pericarditis. Anti- inflammatory agents will help symptoms of acute pericarditis, particularly if it occurs during a course of radiation therapy that should not be discontinued. 6  17 \\nTable 17-2: Non-infectious causes of acute pericarditis.  17 7 \\nCONSTRICTIVE PERICARDITIS Presentation to fusion of the pericardial Constrictive pericarditis is a chronic process that is the result of inflammation leading layers, fibrous thickening, and occasionally calcification. Pericardial thickening alters the elasticity of the sac such that it is not able to distend normally and therefore the ventricles cannot relax normally in diastole. This causes a rise in ventricular diastolic pressures and subsequent decrease in forward flow, resulting in pulmonary and hepatic congestion. Constrictive pericarditis may be the consequence of repeated episodes of acute pericarditis, or may be the result of sustained injury, such as with chest radiation therapy. The presentation of constrictive pericarditis is often years after the inciting event. Anything that causes acute pericarditis can cause constrictive pericarditis, though recent data suggests the risk for progression to constrictive pericarditis is highest after acute bacterial or tuberculous pericarditis and rarely occurs after acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis. Table 17-3: Causes of constrictive pericarditis. The clinical presentation of constrictive pericarditis is typically marked by pulmonary and hepatic congestion, mimicking heart failure. Because of limited diastolic filling, cardiac output may be impaired and therefore patients may complain of fatigue and exercise intolerance. Many patients have hepatic dysfunction due to chronic congestion and may be mistakenly diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis. On exam, there are two classic findings. First is the rise in jugular venous pressure with inspiration, known as Kussmaul\\'s sign. Normally, as the negative intrathoracic pressure is transmitted to the pericardium with inspiration, the jugular venous pressure decreases as blood flows into the right heart. The thickened pericardium does not transmit the negative intrathoracic pressure caused by inspiration. Therefore, when inspiring, blood flow increases into the 8  17 \\nthorax but rapidly fills the right heart such that further blood cannot be accommodated, resulting in a rise in JVP.A \"pericardial knock\" is also classically described. This early diastolic sound presumably represents the abrupt end of ventricular filling due to the inflexible pericardium. Other exam findings are less specific to constrictive pericarditis and relate to volume overload, including rales, ascites, and lower extremity edema. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings are not specific. Chest x-ray may show a calcified pericardium and CT scan can demonstrate a thickened pericardium. A normal pericardium on chest CT often excludes constrictive pericarditis. A cardiac catheterization study is most often needed to establish the diagnosis. Right atrial, right ventricular, pulmonary, left atrial, and left ventricular pressures will all be elevated. There is also the finding of a \"dip and plateau\" or \"square root sign\" which is due to rapid ventricular filling that abruptly plateaus as the distensibility limit of the thickened pericardium is reached. Figure 17-3: Right and left ventricular pressure tracings. Panel A is a normal heart. Panel B is in constrictive pericarditis, demonstrating equalization of diastolic pressure and the \"dip and plateau\" sign. Etiologies Etiologies of constrictive pericarditis mirror those of acute pericarditis, with the caveat that recurrent or sustained inflammation is typically associated with constrictive pericarditis. Additional causes include more unusual infectious agents such as fungi (ie Histoplasmosis or Coccidioidomycosis). Amyloidosis can cause constrictive pericarditis as well as a restrictive cardiomyopathy by deposition of protein in the pericardium and myocardium.  17 9 \\nInitial treatment is often diuretics to decrease filling pressures and improve congestion and edema. However, the relief afforded by medical therapy is often inadequate and patients frequently require surgical removal of the pericardium. The thickening and inflammation involve both pericardial layers, resulting in adherence of the parietal pericardium to the epicardium. This, combined with the difficulty in removing the posterior aspect of the pericardium, often results in incomplete relief of constriction after pericardiectomy. Nonetheless, symptom improvement can be significant. PERICARDIAL EFFUSION AND CARDIAC TAMPONADE Pericardial effusions and the Pericardium imminently life threatening depending on Pericardial effusions can develop in a variety of circumstances and may be benign or the hemodynamic consequence of the effusion. Normally, the pericardium has < 50cc of fluid, which serves as a lubricant between the visceral and parietal layers. The same processes that cause acute pericarditis can result in a pericardial effusion. If the fluid accumulates slowly, the pericardium will stretch to accommodate the volume without a significant rise in pericardial pressure. In these circumstances, there may be as much as 1-2 liters of pericardial fluid. If fluid accumulates rapidly, the pericardium cannot accommodate the additional volume and the pericardial pressure will rise rapidly. In these circumstances, as little as 50-100 cc\\'s can cause a marked increase in pericardial pressure. The pressure-volume relationship of the pericardium results in minimal increase in pressure for a given volume up to a point when the pressure then rises dramatically for relatively little change in volume. If given time, the rise in pressure will occur at higher volumes (ie the curve shifts to the right). Figure 17-4: The Pressure-Volume relationship of the pericardial space. 10  17 \\nEtiologies Slow accumulation of pericardial fluid can result in stable pericardial effusions for long periods of time that require no specific intervention. Often, treatment of the underlying condition will be sufficient to resolve the effusion. Conditions prone to slow accumulation of fluid include hypothyroidism, uremia due to chronic renal failure, and malignancy related effusions. Other conditions are marked by rapid fluid accumulation, such as trauma or aortic dissection. the effusion quickly becomes hemodynamically significant and will require drainage in addition to repair of the inciting injury. Cardiac Tamponade these circumstances, In that raises pericardial pressure. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition caused by a pericardial effusion Increased pericardial pressure compresses the heart and requires a commensurate rise in end ventricular pressure to allow adequate cardiac output. Slow rises in pericardial pressure will trigger humoral responses to retain fluid and increase ventricular end-diastolic filling pressures, whereas rapid rises in pressure do not allow time for this adaptation. The compression of the heart by the pericardial fluid causes increased pericardial pressure, leading to impaired diastolic filling and decreased stroke volume. From the principle that CO = SV x HR, a decrease in stroke volume will initially result in tachycardia to maintain cardiac output. When this compensatory mechanism fails, there will be decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and ultimately shock and death. It is important to recognize tamponade quickly and treat it appropriately. Presentation Exam findings are related both to the presence of an effusion and to the hemodynamic consequences of increased pericardial pressure. The classic triad of tamponade is hypotension, elevated JVP, and muffled heart sounds. However, the more compelling diagnostic finding is pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus paradoxus is not a paradox, but an exaggerated normal physiologic response. Kussmaul coined the term to account for the \"paradox\" of the loss of a pulse despite continued heart sounds. Normally, there is an increase in volume in the right ventricle during inspiration. This briefly shifts the septum to the left, decreasing left ventricular volume and therefore left ventricular stroke volume. The decrease in stroke volume causes a transient decrease in blood pressure, typically less than 10 mm Hg. With cardiac tamponade, the pericardial effusion is compressing the ventricles, which exaggerates the shift of the septum to the left. Patients with tamponade often have a pulsus paradoxus >15 mm Hg (specifically, during inspiration, there is a decrease in blood pressure by >15 mm Hg). Similarly, in tamponade, a palpable radial pulse may disappear with inspiration.  17 11 \\nNote that other conditions that cause increased respiratory effort and thus increased negative intrathoracic pressure can also cause a pulsus paradoxus, such as asthma and COPD exacerbation. Constrictive pericarditis is occasionally associated with a pulsus paradoxus, but because the negative intrathoracic pressure is not transmitted through the thickened pericardium in severe cases, it is not a typical finding. Diagnosis The diagnosis of tamponade is a clinical one, although echocardiography (Figure 17-5) can help in the diagnosis and subsequent therapeutic interventions. The clinical presentation of tamponade depends in part on how long the effusion has been present. For slowly increasing effusions, tamponade may manifest by fatigue, dizziness, or exercise intolerance due to progressively decreasing cardiac output. More commonly, tamponade develops quickly and is manifest by signs of shock, including hypoperfusion and hypotension. Figure 17-5 Echocardiographic appearance of a pericardial effusion (PE). When cardiac chamber pressures are measured in a patient with tamponade, the diagnostic finding is \"equalization\" of pressures. Due to the rise in pericardial pressure, the right atrial, right ventricular end-diastolic, and pulmonary artery diastolic pressures will be equal. After treatment, the pressures will return to their normal ranges. 12  17 \\n Figure 17-6: Distolic equalization of pressures in tamponade. Panel A shows right atrial pressure, B shows right ventricular pressure, C shows pulmonary artery pressure, and D shows pulmonary artery wedge pressure. Note that there is equalization of the mean RA, RV, PA, and PAWP pressures Treatment The treatment of pericardial tamponade is drainage of the effusion. As a temporizing measure, fluids are given to raise the intracardiac pressures to at least the level of the pericardial pressure. Pericardiocentesis is accomplished by advancing a needle through the chest wall into the pericardium and draining the effusion. This is typically done via a subxyphoid approach with the patient sitting somewhat upright. After the needle is advanced into the pericardial space, a wire is threaded through the needle, and the needle is removed. A small catheter is then advanced over the wire, which is secured and allowed to drain. Often patients are in shock and the effusion needs to be drained emergently and therefore the procedure is performed at the bedside. If safe to do so, pericardiocentesis is optimally performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory with simultaneous right heart and pericardial pressure measurements. Initial pressure measurements will demonstrate equal pericardial and right atrial pressures. As fluid is removed, the pericardial pressure will decrease more than the right atrial pressure. The underlying cause of the effusion must be treated effectively to minimize the likelihood of recurrence. In cases of recurrent effusions, such as with metastatic tumors, surgical removal of a portion or of all the pericardium may be necessary.  17 13 \\n Table 17-4: Comparison of Classic Exam Findings in Pericardial Disease.

Her team flies from the town of Talkeetna to base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier (elevation: 7,500 ft) and travels over a period of one week to the advanced base camp at 14,000 feet in elevation. They will remain there until weather and terrain conditions permit an attempt to move up to high camp at 17,000 ft and eventually try for the summit (20,322 ft). 1. Compared to sea level, what changes would you expect to see in the following parameters following arrival at advanced base camp? Focus on general trends only. FIO2: The FIO2 remains the same regardless of the elevation PIO2: Due to the decrease in barometric pressure, this value decreases PAO2: Due to the decrease in barometric pressure and PIO2, this value decreases PaO2: Whenever PAO2 decreases the arterial value decreases as well. SaO2: The oxygen saturation is related to the PaO2 through the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve so any decrease in PaO2 below values seen while breathing ambient air at sea level is associated a decrease in SaO2 (At very high PaO2 values - e.g., > 150 mm Hg - hemoglobin is fully saturated with oxygen and the Hb-O2 dissociation curve is very flat. As a result, decreases in PaO2 in that range are not associated with changes in SaO2). Assuming a barometric pressure of 480 mm Hg at advanced base camp and a PaCO2 of 32 mm Hg, what is the average PAO2 throughout the lung? In the blank figure below, draw a figure demonstrating how the PO2 changes as blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries in an individual at rest at sea level. How will this relationship change when she is at advanced base camp? The change in PO2 as blood moves through the pulmonary capillaries is shown in the figure below. Note that the PO2 rises from the mixed venous value to the alveolar value within only about 0.25 seconds, far shorter than the total time the red blood cells spend in the pulmonary capillaries (referred to as the \"capillary transit time\"). This gives the respiratory system a significant amount of reserve capacity for gas exchange. Even if the alveolar- capillary barrier is thickened, for example, and the rate of diffusion across the barrier is slowed, there is still enough time for complete equilibration. The changes in this relationship following ascent to high altitude are demonstrated in the following figure: Following ascent to high altitude, both the alveolar and mixed venous PO2 are decreased and the difference between them is smaller (i.e., the pressure gradient for diffusion across the alveolar capillary barrier is smaller). This slows the rate of diffusion of oxygen across the barrier, as indicated by the lower rate of rise of PO2 over time. As long as the individual remains at rest, however, there is still enough time for complete equilibration to occur and the capillary PO2 still equilibrates with the alveolar PO2 by the time the red blood cells leave the pulmonary capillaries. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 2 \\n Recall as well that arterial oxygen content is a function of multiple factors: CaO2 = (1.39 x Hb x SaO2) + (.003 x PaO2) We can see that due to the decrease in PaO2 and SaO2, arterial oxygen content decreases following ascent. Due to the increase in heart rate, however, cardiac output increases and counteracts the fall in CaO2, thereby helping to preserve oxygen delivery (For reasons that are beyond the scope of this course, stroke volume does not change much following ascent). Case 1 (continued) 3. While lying in her tent on the first day at advanced base camp, she notices that her resting heart rate was 90 beats/minute, far higher than the resting heart rate she typically recorded at home following her 6-month period of training for the climb. What is the mechanism for the observed change and what are the physiologic implications of this change? As noted earlier, PaO2 decreases as a result of the gain in elevation. One of the main physiologic responses to acute decreases in PaO2 (referred to as acute hypoxemia) is an increase in heart rate. This response is mediated, to a large extent, by an increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. Why is this increase in heart rate important? You will recall that one of the main goals of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems is to deliver oxygen to the tissues. You will recall that oxygen delivery (DO2) is a function of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content: 4. Due to the severe weather systems that delayed plans to go higher on the mountain, the team spends a total of 17 days at or above advanced base camp before successfully reaching the summit. If you were to measure her arterial oxygen content at advanced base camp as the team is preparing to finally head down the mountain, how would this value compare to her arterial oxygen content when the team first arrived at advanced base camp two weeks earlier? With extended exposure to high altitude, arterial oxygen content increases and may even approach her normal sea level value. This occurs for two reasons. First, as she spends more time at altitude, her ventilation continues to increase. This leads to an increase in her PAO2 relative to values seen immediately following ascent, which, in turn, raises the PaO2 and SaO2. CaO2 goes up as a result. The increases in PaO2 and SaO2 will be relatively small, however, and do not contribute as much to the rise in CaO2 as another important physiologic response. This other response is the increase in serum erythropoietin (EPO) concentration that occurs as a result of acute hypoxemia. Over a period of several weeks, this leads to increased red blood cell production and an increase in hemoglobin concentration, which increase the CaO2 to a significant extent.

At the time of admission, his vital signs are: blood pressure 80/42 mm Hg, heart rate 130 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation 98% breathing ambient air. The initial labs drawn in the Emergency Department prior to transfer to the ICU reveal a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL.This is decreased from the value seen on a lab check during an annual health evaluation one week ago (14 g/dL). 1. In the blank figure below, draw the relationship between the hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PO2) and note the typical arterial and venous values for a healthy individual residing at sea level? Another point worth noting on the curve is the P50 (partial pressure at which 50% of the binding sites are occupied). For normal adult hemoglobin this value is ~ 27 mm Hg. The P50 changes in response to factors that change hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen. P50 increases when hemoglobin-oxygen affinity is decreased (increased temperature, decreased pH, increased PCO2, increased 2-3 DPG) and decreases when hemoglobin-oxygen affinity is increased. 2. What are the implications of the shape of this relationship when red blood cells travel through the pulmonary capillaries? What are the implications when the red cells travel through the capillaries in the peripheral tissues? The noteworthy feature of this relationship is its sigmoidal shape. Once the PO2 is above 70 mm Hg, the curve is relatively flat, whereas when the PaO2 is below 60 mm Hg, the curve is much steeper and small changes in PO2 lead to significant changes in the oxygen saturation. The steep portion of the curve is advantageous for loading oxygen onto hemoglobin in the lungs and offloading it in the tissues. When mixed venous blood returns to the lungs with a low PO2 (~ 40 mm Hg) as the soon as PO2 starts to rise as the red cells traverses the pulmonary capillaries, there is rapid uploading of oxygen onto hemoglobin. When the blood gets to the periphery and the tissues start to take up the oxygen, small decreases in the PO2 lead to rapid off-loading of oxygen from hemoglobin, making it available for diffusion into the mitochondria. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 5 \\nCase 2 (continued) The flat portion of the curve is also significant from a physiologic standpoint. Moderate decreases in the arterial PO2 (from 90 to 80 mm Hg, for example) cause only small changes in the hemoglobin oxygen saturation and arterial oxygen content. This gives individuals a degree of physiologic reserve when they develop early or mild problems with gas exchange as in a mild pneumonia. At the same time, if an individual has a PaO2 > 90 mm Hg, raising that further with supplemental oxygen has little effect on oxygen content of the blood as the hemoglobin is already nearly fully saturated. The extra oxygen can go into solution but given the low solubility of oxygen in blood, this does not contribute much to oxygen content. 6 3. What effect will his gastrointestinal bleeding have on the relationship diagrammed in Question 1? What effect will it have on oxygen content? Bleeding leads to a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration. In general, this does not change the relationship between hemoglobin-oxygen saturation and the PO2. For example, assuming a normal P50, if the PO2 is 60 mm Hg, then the oxygen saturation is about 90% regardless of the hemoglobin concentration. The decrease in hemoglobin concentration does, however, have a significant impact on the arterial oxygen content (i.e., the total amount of oxygen in the blood). We can see this by redrawing the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve with oxygen content on the main Y- axis. Note that the saturation axis is now redrawn for each hemoglobin concentration. An alternative way to display this concept is shown in the figure below. Oxygen saturation is displayed on the main Y-axis. Separate axes are shown on the right for separate hemoglobin concentrations and which show how oxygen content varies based on the hemoglobin concentration. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers \\nCase 2 (continued) It can be seen from these figures - as well as from the equation in Question 3 of Case 1 - that as hemoglobin concentration declines, the oxygen content for any given PO2 is decreased. Note, however, that the oxygen saturation axis is essentially \"readjusted\" for each of those curves such that the saturation remains the same regardless of the hemoglobin concentration. The key message from this question is as follows: Changes in hemoglobin concentration alter the oxygen content of the blood but do not affect the saturation. The degree to which hemoglobin\\'s binding sites are filled with oxygen is solely a function of the PO2. Regardless of how much hemoglobin is in the blood, if the PO2 is a certain value then a certain percentage of the hemoglobin binding sites will be occupied by oxygen. 4. What can you do to improve oxygen delivery to his tissues? Which of these interventions would have the biggest impact? To understand the options for improving oxygen delivery to the tissues, we can go back to the equation for oxygen delivery discussed in Case 1: Oxygen Delivery = Cardiac Output x Arterial Oxygen Content This can be rewritten as: Oxygen Delivery = Cardiac Output x [(1.39 x [Hb] x SaO2) + (0.003 x PaO2)] We can see from this equation that oxygen delivery can be improved by increasing one of several variables: cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen. Improving his PaO2 has little to no impact in this case. On admission, he already has an oxygen saturation of 98% indicating that nearly all of hemoglobin\\'s binding sites for oxygen are already occupied. In other words, his arterial blood resides on the flat portion of the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve. Even if you raised his PaO2 with supplemental oxygen, there is little room to add more oxygen to hemoglobin and increase the oxygen content of the blood. A little more oxygen goes into solution but because the solubility of oxygen is so low, this does not change oxygen content much at all. In contrast, increasing cardiac output has a significant impact on oxygen delivery. While this could theoretically be done by increasing heart rate and/or contractility through a vasoactive agent such as dobutamine, the best option for increasing cardiac output would be to administer isotonic intravenous fluids to increase intravascular volume, increase venous return and, therefore, improve his stroke volume. While administration of isotonic fluids is a useful intervention, the best intervention to improve oxygen delivery is to give the patient a blood transfusion. In addition to helping restore intravascular volume and improving stroke volume, it increases the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and, as a result, increases CaO2. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 7 \\n 8 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers \\nCase 3 A healthy 22 year-old woman completes a cardiopulmonary exercise test as part of her training program for the University of Washington rowing team. For the test, she is placed on a bicycle ergometer and asked to pedal against steadily increasing levels of resistance until she cannot turn the pedals any more. As she performs this physical work, various parameters are measured that provide a comprehensive assessment of her maximum exercise capacity, cardiac function and ventilatory function. 1) By sampling expired gas, we are able to derive an estimate of her PAO2 throughout the test. A diagram of the changes in this parameter as she performs steadily increasing levels of work is shown below. How do you account for the patterns observed in the time periods A and B? In general, the PAO2 is a function of how much oxygen is delivered to the alveoli relative to how much is taken away. In other words, it is determined by the balance between the influx and efflux of oxygen from the alveolar space. The influx of oxygen is a function of two variables, alveolar ventilation and the PIO2, while the efflux of oxygen is a function of the cardiac output and oxygen consumption requirements of the body (VO\"). To help understand this concept, we can use the analogy of a bathtub. The level of water in the tub is determined by the balance between how much water comes in via the faucet relative to how much leaves via the drain. The level of water in the tub represents the PAO2. For the lungs, the faucet represents alveolar ventilation (VA) and the PIO2, while the drain represents cardiac output and oxygen consumption. The analogy is not perfect - for example, you cannot completely drain the alveolus of oxygen as you can drain all the water out of a bathtub - but it demonstrates the basic concept of the factors that determine the PAO2. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 9 \\nCase 3 (continued) To understand the findings in the figure, we can consider how each of these parameters changes during exercise. PIO2: This is determined by the barometric pressure and inspired oxygen concentration, neither of which change during exercise. Therefore this parameter is unchanged. Alveolar Ventilation: As we exercise, we breathe more. In particular, our minute ventilation is increased due to an increase in the respiratory rate and tidal volume. As will be discussed further in the next section of the course, this increases the amount of air brought to the alveolus (i.e., the alveolar ventilation). Cardiac output: This increases during exercise. If one exercises at steadily increasing levels of work, cardiac output increases in a linear manner. Oxygen consumption: As with cardiac output, as one exercises at progressively higher levels of work, oxygen consumption increases in a linear manner. During Phase A of the figure above, we see that the PAO2 remains constant as she performs increasing levels of work on the bicycle. This tells us that while her ventilation is increasing in a steady manner through the exercise test, her cardiac output and oxygen consumption are rising at exactly the same rate. In other words, the influx of oxygen to the alveolus and the efflux of oxygen from the alveolus are rising in tandem. This keeps the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveolus constant. In Phase B of exercise, however, the PAO2 starts to rise. This tells us that her alveolar ventilation is now increasing at a faster rate than her cardiac output and oxygen consumption are increasing. Why does this occur? One reason is the fact that once individuals pass a certain point of the test, referred to as the anaerobic or ventilatory threshold, they start to develop a lactic acidosis. Ventilation increases in response to that process as a means to help maintain the acid-base balance of the blood. This topic is covered in further detail during a session on exercise at the end of the course (Chapter 14). One could also hypothesize that PAO2 rose because cardiac output decreased late in exercise while ventilation remained constant or continued to increase. Such a change in cardiac output is unlikely in a healthy individual, however. 2) The figure below shows the changes in arterial and mixed venous oxygen content over the course of the exercise test. How do you account for the observed changes in mixed venous oxygen content? 10 Continued on next page CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) The mixed venous oxygen content (C&\\'O\") refers to the oxygen content of blood drawn from various parts of the body. In general, the C&\\'O\" (as well as mixed venous saturation or S&\\'O\") consumption or VO\"), represented in the figure below. is determined by the balance between how much blood is delivered to the tissue on the one hand, and how much is removed to satisfy tissue metabolic demands (i.e., oxygen the pulmonary circulation. This is a mixture of nearly all of the venous blood returning from As individuals exercise at higher and higher levels of work until they reach their maximum exercise capacity, both oxygen consumption and oxygen delivery increase. The increase in oxygen delivery being driven primarily by an increase in cardiac output, as arterial oxygen content is largely unchanged with exercise because hemoglobin concentration, PaO2 and SaO2 do not change significantly during exercise. A key finding in the figure is that the mixed venous oxygen content decreases as she exercises to higher levels of work. This implies that there must be some issue with the balance between oxygen consumption and oxygen delivery. In particular, the rate of oxygen consumption is likely increasing at a faster rate than the rate of rise in oxygen delivery. In other words, oxygen demand outstrips oxygen supply to which the tissues respond by extracting more oxygen from the blood flowing through the capillary bed, thereby decreasing the mixed venous oxygen content. To look at this another way, we can refer to the Fick equation: VO\"=Q\\tx\\t(C$O\"-C&\\'O\") CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 11 \\n Rearranging this equation, we get the following: (C$O\"-C&\\'O\")=\\tVO\"Q The term on the left, referred to as the arteriovenous oxygen content difference, represents the amount of oxygen extracted from the blood as it moves through the tissue capillary beds. Referring back to the figure, we see that this gets larger as she exercises to higher and higher levels of work. The arteriovenous oxygen content difference increases because the numerator (VO\")\\tincreases relative to the denominator (Q).\\tIn other words, oxygen consumption is increasing at a faster rate than cardiac output and, therefore, oxygen delivery. These concepts are covered again in Chapter 14. 12 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers \\nCase 4 During a spell of very cold weather, a 13 year-old boy is brought into the emergency department by his parents with obtundation. According to his mother, the electricity in their apartment had been off for two days following a severe wind storm and the family had been trying various things to warm their house, including bringing their charcoal grill into the living room. Upon arrival, he is normotensive with a heart rate of 135, respiratory rate of 24. On exam, she is taking deep breaths at an increased rate. He has vesicular breath sounds without crackles or wheezes. His cardiac exam reveals a rapid rate but no murmur. His abdomen is soft and non-tender and his skin shows no rashes or cyanosis. An arterial blood gas is drawn while he is breathing ambient air and reveals the following: pH 7.20 - HCO3 10 PaCO2 25 PaO2 110 On his other labs, his hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL (normal 13-15 g/dL), while his serum lactate is 15 mEq/L (normal < 2 mEq/L). An echocardiogram is performed and reveals normal left ventricular size, diastolic filling and systolic function. His chest radiograph shows no focal opacities or effusions. 1. Why does she have a severe lactic acidosis despite the fact that his PaO2 is normal and the echocardiogram demonstrates normal left ventricular function? What clinical condition could explain this picture? Normally the pyruvate produced by glycolysis enters the mitochondria where it undergoes oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl-coenzyme A, which subsequently enters the Krebs cycle and leads to the generation of large amounts of ATP.For this to occur, oxygen must be present. If oxygen is absent, the pyruvate is, instead, converted to lactate. Therefore, accumulation of lactate, also referred to as lactic acidosis, serves as a marker of impaired oxygen delivery to the tissues. Lactic acid levels can increase for other reasons beyond impaired tissue oxygen delivery but this is one of the primary situations in which this problem is seen. To understand how oxygen delivery may be impaired, recall that it is a function of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content: From this equation, we can see that oxygen delivery can be decreased by several factors: decreased cardiac output, decreased hemoglobin concentration, decreased oxygen binding to hemoglobin and decreased PaO2. The data from this case helps narrow this differential diagnosis further. The finding of normal left ventricular filling and function suggest cardiac output is likely normal. His labs reveal that she has a normal hemoglobin concentration and a supranormal PaO2 (This latter finding is due to the fact that she is hyperventilating to compensate for the lactic acidosis, a concept that will be discussed later in the course). As a result, we are left to hypothesize that there is some problem with oxygen binding to hemoglobin; even though the PO2 is great, oxygen is not binding to hemoglobin and is not being delivered to the tissues in sufficient quantities. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 13 \\n One situation in which this phenomenon occurs is carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. He likely had exposure to CO when the family was burning their charcoal grill inside their inadequately ventilated living room. CO has 250 times the affinity for hemoglobin as oxygen does and outcompetes oxygen for the hemoglobin binding sites. As a result, even if the PaO2 is normal, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin and oxygen delivery to the tissues decreases. When sufficient quantities of CO are present in the blood, oxygen delivery can be impaired to the point that lactic acidosis develops due to impaired mitochondrial function. 2. How will arterial oxygen content change in this situation? What happens to Case 4 (continued) hemoglobin\\'s affinity for oxygen? Because carbon monoxide outcompetes oxygen for the hemoglobin binding sites, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin despite what may be a normal or even increased PaO2. With less oxygen bound to hemoglobin, arterial oxygen content is decreased. In essence the patient has a \"functional anemia.\" Even though they may have normal hemoglobin concentration, the arterial oxygen content resembles the situation you would see if they had anemia or severe blood loss due to hemorrhage; they have a lower arterial oxygen content at any given PO2 than they would if there were no carbon monoxide in the blood. The amount of carbon monoxide bound to hemoglobin and the subsequent decrease in arterial oxygen content varies based on the severity of the patient\\'s exposure to CO and the subsequent partial pressure of CO in the blood. Besides outcompeting oxygen for hemoglobin binding sites, CO has another effect on oxygen transport. When CO binds to hemoglobin, hemoglobin undergoes a conformational change that increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining binding sites not occupied by CO.This causes a leftward shift (as well as a change in shape) of the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve. This effect is important as the increased affinity makes it harder for hemoglobin to release oxygen when the red blood cells arrive at the tissue capillaries. One further effect of carbon monoxide is that it can inhibit cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby interfering with oxygen utilization in the electron transport chain and the generation of ATP.CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 1 Answers 14 \\nCase 4 (Continued) 3. As you are writing PICU admission orders, the attending physician in the Emergency Department asks you if you would like to send the patient to Virginia Mason Medical Center for treatment in that facility\\'s hyperbaric chamber. How might this help the patient from a physiologic standpoint? By placing an individual in a hyperbaric chamber, you can raise the barometric pressure to which they are exposed well above the normal sea level value of 760 mm Hg. When this is done in conjunction increased FIO2, there is a marked increase in the PIO2, PAO2 and, subsequently PaO2, which has two physiologic benefits in CO poisoning. First, attachment to the heme moiety in hemoglobin is a competitive binding process. While CO easily outcompetes oxygen at normal PaO2, at the very high oxygen partial pressures seen in hyperbaric therapy, oxygen does a better job competing with CO for the hemoglobin binding sites. This helps shorten the half-live of CO significantly. Second, while the putting oxygen into solution at normal or mildly increased PaO2 makes little contribution to oxygen content and oxygen delivery, at the very high partial pressures seen with hyperbaric therapy, enough oxygen goes into solution to raise both content and delivery enough to help the oxygen-starved tissues. This can be appreciated in the figure on the next page. The hatched circles represent the change in dissolved oxygen and oxygen content at high oxygen partial pressures.

The pain is aching and cramping in nature and is relieved by resting for 3-5 minutes. It recurs each time when walking that distance, or earlier if walking uphill or carrying groceries. The patient has no toe pain while sleeping. ROS is otherwise unremarkable. Past medical history includes hypertension, and current smoking. Medications include lisinopril for hypertension. On examination, the patient is in no acute distress. Head and neck exam and cranial nerve exam are normal. Carotid, radial, and femoral pulses are normal. There is a bruit at the left neck and pedal pulses are weak. Cardiac exam demonstrates a regular rate and rhythm and no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation with distant breath sounds. Abdomen is soft and non- tender and without masses. Feet have no wounds nor ulcerations and have slow capillary refill. Question 1 What is the most likely diagnosis? What is this patient\\'s Rutherford classification? This is a typical case of peripheral artery occlusive disease with moderate claudication (Rutherford Classification Stage 2) (Syllabus Table 16-4). The patient has the risk factors of age, smoking, and hypertension and their exam suggests carotid artery disease. Notably, PAOD is a systemic process, not just an issue of leg perfusion.  11-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 What test can you order to confirm this diagnosis? If confirmed, what is the next step? Ankle:Brachial indices (ABI) could be done at the bedside to confirm the diagnosis: 0.9-1.3 is normal 0.5-0.89 usually indicates a single level of arterial blockage 0.3-0.49 usually indicates multiple levels of arterial blockage <0.3 usually indicates critical limb ischemia If PAOD is confirmed, a formal vascular laboratory arterial duplex ultrasound would be the next step in determining level of disease. CTA and MRA could be used, but they are expensive and carry the risks associated with contrast media. These studies are reserved for planning specific treatment when duplex does not provide sufficient information. Question 3 When counseling a patient with peripheral artery disease, what are the most important issues to discuss? Why? The most clinically important issue to discuss with a patient with a new diagnosis of PAOD is that the atherosclerotic disease process is systemic, not isolated to the lower extremities. Patients with POAD are 5 times more likely to die from heart attack or stroke than are age matched patients without PAOD.The diagnosis of PAOD is an important opportunity to help a patient prevent death from CAD or CVA.It is also important to discuss prognosis. The natural history of mild to moderate claudication is fairly benign. 75-80% of patients will experience stability of their symptoms, with 5-10% experiencing significant improvement with risk factor modification, and another 5-10% experiencing progression to chronic limb threatening ischemia over a 5-year time frame. 2  11-Answers \\nQuestion 4 What are the initial treatment recommendations for a patient with PAOD? Aggressive risk factor modification is the essential first step in treating a patient with PAD.This includes absolute smoking and nicotine cessation, initiation of a daily exercise program, and treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Statin medications are recommended for all patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. Anti-platelet therapy with aspirin should be started. Question 5 After discussing the medical treatment recommendations, the patient asks about surgery. What do you tell them? Surgical treatment includes both endovascular (percutaneous angioplasty and stenting), open surgical bypass, or a combination of the two. For patients with claudication, surgical treatment is controversial. In general, patients with claudication are only eligible for surgical treatment when they have shown good risk factor control and find that their quality of life is severely impacted by the walking limitation. This is a more complex issue, as often a patient\\'s perception of their walking limitation is heavily influenced by their overall perception of their health, ie patients may attribute much of their overall quality of life to claudication rather than other health issues. Thus, treatment of claudication also requires careful management of expectations. Question 6 Five years later, the patient returns to your clinic with pain in the right distal foot that is continuous at night when lying down in bed. What treatment do you recommend? The pain described is called rest pain and occurs when blood flow is so low that the tissues have insufficient oxygen to meet their baseline metabolic demands. The patient\\'s Rutherford Classification is now 4, changing the diagnosis to chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI). Urgent revascularization (balloon angioplasty, stenting, endarterectomy, or bypass) is indicated for all eligible patients with CLTI since this would progress to limb loss without revascularization.  11-Answers 3 \\nCase 2 You are on call in the Emergency Department one evening when the patient from Case 1 presents with transient left eye blindness. They were watching TV when suddenly they lost vision in the left eye. The episode was \"like a window shade coming down over my eye.\" This happened an hour ago and within 5-10 minutes, vision returned to normal. There are no other new symptoms and the patient is currently feeling fine. Question 1 What is the differential diagnosis for these visual symptoms and why? This clinical presentation is a classic amaurosis fugax. It is most likely due to an embolic event to the retinal artery resulting in transient retinal ischemia. This can be due to any source of thromboemboli. The most common sources are a ruptured or ulcerated carotid plaque or from the left atrium as the result of atrial fibrillation. The differential diagnosis for monocular blindness is extensive, but most other causes are not self-limited to minutes. Question 2 What diagnostic studies would you order? The essential studies include a carotid artery duplex ultrasound, an electrocardiogram to evaluate for arrhythmia, and an echocardiogram to evaluate for thrombus. Additional studies are done on a case-by-case basis. A non-contrast head CT is done if there are persistent neurologic deficits to ensure there is no large area infarction or hemorrhage (both are signs of stroke). MRI/MRA is useful for patients with evidence of stroke to assess the size of the infarction and evaluate for hemorrhagic conversion of the infarcted tissue. CTA can be used to evaluate aortic arch, common carotid, and intra-cerebral vascular lesions. Question 3 What treatment would you recommend for this patient in the Emergency Department? The initial treatment is an anti-platelet medication. If the patient is not on an aspirin, then initiation of an aspirin is essential to prevent additional platelet mediated intra-arterial thromboemboli from forming on the ulcerated plaque. If the patient is already on an aspirin, then the addition of clopidogrel is indicated. Statins are usually initiated as well, although the benefit in the immediate setting of carotid disease is not well defined. As with PAOD, risk factor modification should be addressed, including absolute smoking cessation, exercise, and blood pressure control. 4  11-Answers \\nAfter conducting the appropriate work-up, you determine that this event is due to a high- grade 72% carotid artery stenosis. Question 4 Would you recommend surgical treatment? Surgical treatment is indicated for symptomatic, >70% carotid stenosis, which this patient has. For those interested, this number came from the NASCET trial (Reference: PMID 1852179), a large randomized control trial from the 1980\\'s demonstrating a significant risk reduction of recurrent neurologic events after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Some patients with carotid stenosis 50-70% are likely to benefit from CEA, but the risk reduction is less. Surgical treatment for asymptomatic patients is controversial and less frequently done as medical therapy has improved. Some patients are still likely to benefit - particularly younger patients with disease progression despite optimal medical therapy, and patients with critical \"pre-occlusive\" stenosis.  11-Answers 5 \\nCase 3 A 66 year-old patient presents to the emergency department with 1 hour of feeling lightheaded and abdominal pain. They awoke this morning feeling lightheaded; this sensation has persisted for the past hour and is worse with standing. The abdominal pain is central, \"deep and dull,\" rated 7/10. On ROS, there is no nausea, diarrhea, nor constipation. ROS is otherwise unremarkable. The patient does not have regular medical care, has no known past medical history, and takes no medications. They have a 50 pack-year history of smoking but quit last month. On examination: Question 1 Vitals: General CV: Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: Rectal: Extremities: Feet have no wounds nor ulcerations. Afebrile, BP 110/60 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, RR 18, O2Sat 100% Alert. Appears pale and diaphoretic. Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs. Carotid, radial, and femoral pulses are present but weak. No pedal pulse. Generalized tenderness to deep palpation, no rebound nor guarding No blood in the rectal vault. What is your leading diagnosis for this patient\\'s presentation? Which findings are most concerning? This clinical presentation is most concerning for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient is at risk given the history of smoking. This current presentation of new abdominal pain, and physical exam with hypotension, tachycardia and abdominal tenderness are concerning for rupture. The exam did not reveal a pulsatile abdominal mass, but this does not rule out AAA.The relatively low blood pressure, tachycardia, orthostasis, and diminished distal pulses are all consistent with hypovolemic shock, which can occur in the setting of bleeding. These are very concerning clinical findings and merit emergent evaluation. Question 2 What diagnostic studies would you order? Because the patient is normotensive, they are stable enough to undergo further imaging. A stat CT scan with contrast is the best test to both diagnose an AAA and to provide detailed anatomic information to plan for repair if rupture is present. The CT will also assess for other common causes of intra-abdominal emergency. 6  11-Answers \\nECG shows normal sinus tachycardia. The patient returns from the CT scan after which they suddenly develop intense back and abdominal pain. Vitals are now BP 90/50, HR 130, RR 24, O2 Sat 100%. Question 3 What is the leading concern and what is the most appropriate intervention? This patient needs emergent surgical intervention. The abrupt onset of severe back and abdominal pain is typical of an acute aneurysm rupture, which can be confirmed by the CT scan. Question 4 Why is a large abdominal aortic aneurysm at greater risk of rupture compared to a smaller aneurysm? Recall the law of LaPlace from Chapter 13: where 𝜎 = ΔP x r 2h 𝜎 = wall stress ΔP = the transmural pressure gradient (from endocardium to epicardium) r = internal radius, h = wall thickness As the radius of the aneurysm grows, wall stress directly increases. Wall stress is the force on the tissue fibers that tend to pull them apart, thus making them more susceptible to rupture.  11-Answers 7 \\nCase 4 A 42 year-old patient with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presents to the emergency department with chest pain. They are awake and alert and report that the chest pain that is worse with inspiration and better when leaning forward. An ECG shows: Question 1 What is your interpretation of the ECG? The ECG shows diffuse ST-segment elevation consistent with acute pericarditis or early repolarization. The changes are not suggestive of an ST-elevation MI.The positional and pleuritic chest pain is consistent with acute pericarditis. Question 2 What therapy do you recommend? Given the clinical situation and the typical chest pain of acute pericarditis, treatment with anti- inflammatory medications is appropriate. 8  11-Answers \\nCase 5 A 52 year-old patient presents with a 16 pound weight gain in the past month, dyspnea with exertion (ie climbing one flight of stairs), nausea, abdominal bloating, and lower extremity edema. Past medical history is notable for mild cardiomyopathy with EF 48%, and recurrent ventricular tachycardia status post multiple defibrillator placements including a left anterior thoracotomy 15 years ago to place an epicardial electrode patch, and two epicardial ablation procedures. On physical exam: Vitals signs: General: Cardiovascular: Afebrile, BP 117/85, HR 60 bpm. Comfortable at rest. Regular rhythm and rate, no murmurs/rubs/gallops, normal S1 and S2, JVP 15 cm Clear to auscultation Soft, nontender. 3+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema to the knees. Pulmonary: Abdominal: Extremities: An ECG shows an atrial paced rhythm and nonspecific T wave inversions. Question 1 What is your differential diagnosis for this patient\\'s right heart failure? Are they risk for pericardial disease? What diagnostic study and medical treatment will you recommend? The nausea, bloating, elevated JVP, and lower extremity edema are consistent with right heart failure. The differential diagnosis of right heart failure is broad and includes long-standing left heart failure, RV infarction, severe pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial constriction. This patient is at risk for pericardial constriction given the history of three procedures in the pericardial space. Notably, dyspnea on exertion is a symptom of left heart failure. However, patients, including this one, with pericardial constriction often present with predominantly right heart failure signs and symptoms. An echocardiogram should be ordered to reassess ventricular function, pulmonary artery pressure, right and left heart filling pressures, and the pericardial anatomy. A pericardial effusion may be present in some patients with constriction. Diuretics should be recommended to treat symptoms by lowering filling pressures. However there is no medical treatment for the constrictive physiology.  11-Answers 9 \\nThe patient takes a loop diuretic and loses 18 pounds with improvement in exercise capacity and decreased edema. An echocardiogram confirms stable, mild systolic dysfunction and no significant valve disease nor pericardial effusion. However, one month later, the patient has recurrence of nausea and edema and gains 12 pounds despite diuretic therapy. JVP is again elevated to 15 cm. Question 2 A right heart catheterization confirms elevated right and left heart filling pressures. How do you interpret the simultaneous right and left ventricular pressure tracings below? There is a classic square root (or dip and plateau sign) in the ventricular tracings during diastole. Note the near equalization of RV and LV diastolic pressure. These findings are consistent with the constrictive physiology of pericardial constriction. Question 3 What do you recommend? This patient has pericardial constriction and should undergo pericardiectomy. 10  11-Answers \\nCase 6 You are called to the ICU to see a 50 year-old patient with acute shortness of breath. They have a history of metastatic lung cancer and are undergoing chemotherapy. The patient was admitted with fever and sepsis yesterday. You notice the arterial line tracing on the ICU monitor. Question 1 What is your diagnosis? What is your plan for evaluation and treatment? The tracing shows a marked inspiratory fall in arterial blood pressure with systolic blood pressure falling 20-30 points. This is pulsus paradoxus, and cardiac tamponade should be considered as the cause. Normally, there is an increase in volume in the right ventricle during inspiration. This briefly shifts the septum to the left, decreasing left ventricular volume and therefore left ventricular stroke volume. The decrease in stroke volume causes a transient decrease in blood pressure, typically less than 10 mm Hg. With cardiac tamponade, the pericardial effusion is compressing the ventricles, which exaggerates the shift of the septum to the left, thus lowering left ventricular stroke volume even more during inspiration. Therefore, we see pulsus paradoxus. Metastatic cancer is a risk factor for pericardial metastases and a pericardial effusion. An echocardiogram should be emergently performed to assess for a pericardial effusion causing cardiac tamponade. If present, percutaneous drainage is the treatment.  11-Answers 11 \\nExercise 2 Match the diagnoses to the expected physical exam findings. Pericardial tamponade Pericardial constriction Acute pericarditis Friction rub Kussmaul\\'s sign (rare) Pericardial knock Pulsus paradoxus x X x (rare) x Question 1 What is the timing of a pericardial knock? A pericardial knock occurs 90-120 msec after S2, so the timing is very similar to an S3 gallop. The sound is described as high frequency, and at least one study correlated the sound to the sudden cessation of ventricular filling associated with constriction. Question 2 What is Kussmaul\\'s sign? Is it specific for pericardial constriction? Kussmaul\\'s sign is a paradoxic rise in jugular venous pressure with inspiration. It is classically associated with pericardial constriction but can occur in other situations where right ventricular filling is impaired including right ventricular infarction.\\nThe ECG represents the formation and conduction of electrical signals in the heart. Draw the standard QRS complex, and identify the P wave, QRS complex, ST segment and T wave. What do each of the components represent in terms of how the cardiac impulse spreads throughout the heart? How does each component correlate to a ventricular myocyte action potential? The P wave represents the spread of a stimulus through the atria muscle (atrial depolarization), which occurs after SA node discharges (fires). This occurs during Phase 4 of the ventricular myocyte action potential because conduction has not yet reached the ventricles. The QRS complex represents conduction through the ventricles (ventricular depolarization, represented by Phase 0, 1 and part of 2), after the impulse has moved out of the AV node. It travels down the His-Purkinje system, and through the Purkinje fibers. The ST segment and T wave represent the return of stimulated ventricular muscle to the resting state (ventricular repolarization). This correlates with the latter part of Phase 2 as calcium channels begin to inactivate, and throughout Phase 3.  2-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 In the figure above, label the PR and QT intervals. What is the normal length of these intervals? What is the physiologic implication of an increase in these intervals? The PR interval is measured from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex. The PR interval represents the time it takes for the depolarization stimulus to spread through the atria. It starts when an impulse exits the sinus node and ends when the impulse exits the AV junction (AV node and His-Purkinje system). The AV junction is like a \"pause button.\" Here the impulse is delayed in order to give the ventricles sufficient time to fill with blood before ventricular depolarization occurs. In adults, the normal PR interval is usually between 120 and 200 msec. A prolonged PR interval indicates a conduction abnormality in the AV node. The QT interval is measured from the beginning of the QRS to the end of the T wave. A normal QT interval length depends on the heart rate, but tends to be 330-350 msec. A prolonged QT interval represents a slow, abnormal repolarization and may be the substrate for a potentially lethal tachyarrhythmia called torsade de pointes (also known as polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). 2  2-Answers \\nQuestion 3 Tetanus is the temporal summation of contraction caused by successive action potentials. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be tetanized. Explain why using a diagram of an action potential. The ventricles contract throughout most of the action potential - specifically during Phases 0, 1, and most of 2. Notably, this is approximately the same period as the absolute refractory period (ARP) when no other stimulus can cause another action potential. As a result, ventricular contractions cannot occur on top of each other, and thus there can be no tetanus. As the ventricle relaxes, the action potential enters the relative refractory period, adding further protection from additional contraction by requiring a larger-than-normal stimulus in order to fire a second action potential. By protecting the myocytes from re-stimulation during this time, the heart is allowed to relax and fill with blood prior to the next contraction. This is in sharp contrast to what happens in skeletal muscle, where the force in response to two successive stimuli can sum so that a greater force is produced than in an isolated individual contraction. This occurs in skeletal muscle because the action potential duration (and hence refractory period) are very short compared to the duration of skeletal muscle contraction. Thus, skeletal muscle fibers can be re-stimulated to contract after the refractory period of the first action potential, but long before the original contraction has subsided.  2-Answers 3 \\nExercise 1 For each of the next 4 rhythm strips, calculate the approximate heart rate. This is a good opportunity to review the 3 methods of HR calculation. The utility of each method depends on the cadence shown (ie regular vs irregular rhythm). Regular rhythms have the same number of boxes between each QRS complex. Irregular rhythms do not. QRS counting: number of QRS complexes in a 10-sec strip multiplied x 6. Because the standard 12-lead tracing records 10 seconds of data, counting the number of QRS complexes and multiplying by 6 yields the number of beats per 60 sec (hence beats per minute, abbreviated bpm). This works for any rhythm. Big box method: count number of big boxes between two consecutive beats, then divide 300 by this number (300 x 0.2 sec/ box = 60 seconds). This only works for regular rhythms that are not too fast. Small box method: count number of small boxes between two consecutive beats, then divide 1500 by this number (1500 x 0.04 sec/small box = 60 seconds). This only works for regular rhythms. QRS counting: approximately 90 bpm (15 beats in 10 sec = 90 beats in 60 sec) Big box method: slightly more than 3 big boxes, so slightly less than 100 bpm Small box method: 1500 / 16-18 = 83-94 bpm (slight variation between beats). Here, we cannot use a box counting method since the cadence is irregular (number of boxes varies from beat to beat). Therefore, the QRS counting method is the best, resulting in 60 bpm. Note the marked by irregularity and absent P waves. This is rhythm is atrial fibrillation, a major and common arrhythmia, which will be discussed in next lecture. 4  2-Answers \\n  QRS counting: 26 x 6 = 156 bpm Big box method: 2 big boxes, so 300/2 = 150 bpm. Small box method: 1500 / 10 = 150 bpm. QRS counting: 7 x 6 = 42 bpm Big box method: 7 big boxes, so 300/7 = 43 bpm. Small box method: 1500 / 35 = 43 bpm.  2-Answers 5 \\nExercise 2 What criteria determine the presence of normal sinus rhythm? 1) HR 60-100 2) Upright P waves in II, negative P waves in aVR 3) A 1:1 P-QRS complex ratio (every P wave is followed by a QRS). For each of the following Lead II rhythm strips, identify the P-wave, QRS complex and T- wave and use this information to determine whether or not the rhythm is normal sinus. This is not normal sinus rhythm-there is an inverted P in lead II, although there is a 1:1 P-QRS relationship, and the heat rate is 60 beats per minute. This is termed an ectopic atrial rhythm. This is sinus, but not normal sinus rhythm: there is an upright P in II, a 1:1 P:QRS relationship, but the heart rate is ~150 beats per minute. This is sinus tachycardia. This is sinus, but not normal sinus rhythm: there is an upright P in II, a 1:1 P:QRS relationship, but the heart rate is ~45 beats per minute. This is sinus bradycardia. This is normal sinus rhythm: there is an upright P in II, a 1:1 P:QRS relationship, and the heart rate is 83-94 beats per minute. 6  2-Answers \\nExercise 3 In the following ECGs, describe the general orientation of the QRS axis (normal, right, left). If there are biphasic QRS complexes, calculate the axis more precisely. Normal axis (QRS is upright in I and II, downward in aVR). Normal axis. Here, biphasic leads can help. The QRS is upright in I and aVL.The biphasic QRS in II means the axis is 90° away from II (either at -30° or +150°). We know it is not +150° because the QRS in aVR is negative, indicating the axis is pointed away from the right. Thus, the axis is approximately -30°, indicating a normal axis that is borderline to left axis deviation (since normal is from -30° to +100°).  2-Answers 7 \\n Right axis deviation. The QRS is downward in I (suggesting the mean vector is going away from the left), and upright in II and III, and aVF.8  2-Answers \\nExercise 4 For each of the following ECGs, identify the primary conduction abnormality and describe the clinical context in which they may be seen. This is a right bundle branch block (RBBB) pattern. Note the rSR\\' in V1, and small S waves in V4-V6 and lead I.RBBB can be a normal variant in healthy individuals. It can also be a consequence of pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, and certain congenital heart diseases (e.g., atrial septal defects). It is often seen after cardiac surgery. It usually requires no intervention by itself. In addition, there is a very long PR interval (approximately 400 ms). The RBBB and long PR together both suggest conduction disease, and the RBBB may not be a normal variant. This is a left bundle branch block (LBBB) pattern. It is usually a sign of heart disease, including long-standing hypertension, coronary heart disease, severe heart failure, and degenerative conduction disease. Note the wide QRS, secondary ST changes, and left axis deviation (often seen in LBBB).  2-Answers 9 \\nExercise 5 In the following ECGs, determine the rate, rhythm, axis, and intervals and state whether you see a bundle branch block or not. For example, \"Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 bpm, with normal axis, normal intervals, and no evidence of conduction abnormalities such as a right or left bundle branch block.\" Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 84 bpm with normal axis and normal intervals. There is no evidence of conduction abnormalities such as a right or left bundle branch block. Normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 75 bpm with normal axis and normal intervals. There is no evidence of conduction abnormalities such as a right or left bundle branch block. 10  2-Answers \\nNormal sinus rhythm at a rate of 70 bpm with a left bundle branch block. There is a left axis deviation and normal intervals. Normal sinus rhythm at 68 bpm with normal axis. There is a right bundle branch block, and a prolonged PR interval.  2-Answers 11 \\nExercise 6 Shown below is a magnified view of a section of lead V5 in a young patient who presented with palpitations and a syncopal episode. What is the major abnormality? This strip from lead V5 demonstrates prolongation of the QT interval. At a normal HR, the QT interval is likely prolonged when it is greater than one half the length of the RR interval. This is a simple rule of thumb that can be used rather than having to calculate the interval more precisely. This tracing shows a very long QT interval. A prolonged QT interval predisposes patients to potentially lethal tachyarrhythmias. Note that a QT interval that is less than one-half the RR interval is not necessarily normal (particularly at slow heart rates) while a QT interval greater than one half the RR interval is not necessarily prolonged (particularly at very fast heart rates). You do not need to memorize these equations, but it is helpful to know that it is possible to calculate the corrected QT interval more precisely than the simple rule of thumb noted above: Corrected QT = sqrt(RR interval). Name the waves of the five QRS complexes shown below. ECG nomenclature helps physicians communicate important findings with each other. The answers below are based on the following rules: The first positive deflection is the R wave. The first negative deflection is the Q wave. The second negative deflection is the S wave. A second positive deflection is termed a R\\' (R prime). A 40 year-old patient presents to your primary care clinic with progressive shortness of breath. HPI: Six weeks ago, the patient had an upper respiratory tract infection characterized by low- grade fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and non-productive cough. 5 weeks ago, they noticed dyspnea when walking up 2 flights of stairs. They were seen by their physician who diagnosed probable bronchitis and prescribed a five-day course of azithromycin. The patient noted no improvement in symptoms. For the past 2 weeks, the patient has been dyspneic with walking less than 1 block on level ground, and for the past week, dyspneic at rest. When laying down, they must prop themselves up on multiple pillows to avoid dyspnea. They frequently awaken at night with a \"smothering sensation\" a few hours after falling asleep. Other symptoms include abdominal bloating, ankle swelling, and poor appetite. The patient has no chest pain. Past Medical History: No known risk factors for coronary artery disease or venous thrombosis, no history of alcohol or drug use, no rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease. Family History: No family history of heart disease. On physical exam: PMI (point of maximal impulse) is laterally Afebrile, BP 90/70 mm Hg, HR 110 bpm, RR 30 per minute Sitting up in a chair, appears mildly short of breath. displaced 6 cm from midclavicular line. S3 gallop, 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex, 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border which varies with respiration. JVP is 15 cm. Bilateral rales extending 1/3 upward from lung bases with scattered wheezes. Mild distention. Liver edge is palpable 2 cm below the right costal margin. 2+ bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Cool. Use the history and exam to support your answer to the following questions: a. Is this presentation systolic or diastolic heart failure? b. Is it left, right, or biventricular heart failure? c. Is this patient in acute decompensated heart failure or chronic heart failure? The S3 gallop strongly suggests LV systolic dysfunction. The laterally displaced PMI is consistent with LV enlargement. These findings are consistent with systolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF). Left heart failure signs and symptoms include: pulmonary rales, dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Right heart failure signs and symptoms include: jugular venous distention, decreased appetite (suggesting bowel edema), and lower extremity edema. Thus, this is biventricular heart failure. This patient\\'s heart failure is decompensated as demonstrated by the symptoms of volume overload (as above) and signs of low cardiac output (cool extremities and narrow pulse pressure). Thus, this patient is in acute decompensated heart failure. If the patient had no symptoms of volume overload, this would be chronic heart failure (ie a chronic, stable state). Question 2 What is this patient\\'s functional class? Class IV given dyspnea at rest. Question 3 What is your differential diagnosis for the etiology? The most likely cause of this heart failure presentation is viral myocarditis based on the recent viral illness. Other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy (Syllabus Table 9-1) are excluded by the history: no toxin exposures (drugs, alcohol, anthracyclines), no coronary artery disease risk factors, no family history of cardiomyopathy. Other less likely possibilities include endocarditis with acute mitral regurgitation (no fever) and chronic mitral regurgitation (should consider given the apical holosystolic murmur). Pericardial constriction can cause right and left heart failure, but this patient has no apparent risk factors (ie chest radiation therapy or prior cardiac surgery). Question 4 What test would you order early during the evaluation? An echocardiogram to assess ventricular size and function and valve function (since ventricular size can be altered by abnormal valves). 2  4-Answers \\nQuestion 5 Name the neurohormonal systems activated with low cardiac output and describe their effects. Which system or systems lead to sodium and water retention? Which are beneficial? Which lead to long-term adverse effects on the myocardium? With low cardiac output, there is upregulation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and increased levels of natriuretic peptides and antidiuretic hormone (ADH): 1. SNS: Early activation of SNS results in positive inotropic and chronotropic effects with increase in cardiac output. There is also constriction of the venous system to augment preload and subsequently, cardiac output. The SNS also directly stimulates renin release via beta1 receptors in the kidney, thus contributing to activation of the RAAS, leading to sodium and water retention. 2. RAAS: In addition to the SNS as above, this system is activated by decreased renal perfusion due to low cardiac output. The role of RAAS is to increase blood volume to augment cardiac output and maintain blood pressure. It does this by stimulating sodium and water retention. 3. Natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP): These are produced in the atria and ventricles in response to pressure and volume overload. They act to reduce volume overload by promoting renal excretion of salt and water, and lower afterload by direct vasodilatory effects. They also directly antagonize the hypertrophic action of angiotensin II on the myocardium and oppose the action of RAAS.Thus, natriuretic peptides are beneficial. 4. ADH: Low cardiac output activates the carotid sinus and aortic arch baroreceptors, resulting in release of ADH.This hormone causes water retention and increases systemic vascular resistance (afterload). Water retention can contribute to hyponatremia (low sodium) in patients with heart failure. Short-term activation of SNS and RAAS are beneficial to increase cardiac output and maintain blood pressure. However, over time these systems become detrimental: 1. Long-term activation of SNS (resulting in tachycardia and elevated systemic vascular resistance) increase myocardial oxygen consumption and afterload, contributing to further deterioration in myocardial function over time. 2. Long-term activation of RAAS (resulting in elevated systemic vascular resistance) also increases afterload. 3. Both systems result in salt and water retention, thus increasing preload. However, in the setting of poor ventricular function, this can lead to pulmonary edema. 4. The SNS and RAAS systems also have direct negative remodeling effects on the heart and increase myocardial fibrosis.  4-Answers 3 \\nQuestion 6 Draw a ventricular performance curve for this patient and for a person with normal cardiac function. Where your patient on their curve? The entire curve has shifted down and to the right. That is, for any given preload (LVEDP) there is now a lower stroke volume, leading to lower cardiac output. The point for the patient has moved from point A to point C.Thus, not only is the stroke volume lower (resulting in lower cardiac output), the patient also has higher LVEDP from volume overload. The high LVEDP results in pulmonary congestion and dyspnea. Question 7 Draw a pressure-volume (P-V) loop for this patient and compare it to a normal P-V loop. How do the LVEDP, EDV, ESV, and SV compare to the normal heart? The black line (1) shows ESPVR (end-systolic pressure-volume relation) for a heart with normal function, and the blue dotted outline (2) shows ESPVR for systolic heart failure. In systolic heart failure, ESPVR has shifted down from line 1 to line 2 representing a decrease in contractility. As a result, the new PV loop illustrates the increase in LVEDP, EDV (end diastolic volume, an approximation of preload), and ESV (end systolic volume), and the decrease in SV (stroke volume). 4  4-Answers \\nYou decide to admit the patient to the hospital and begin to write their admission orders. Question 8 For your patient\\'s acute decompensated heart failure, your first order a diuretic to lower preload and relieve their symptoms. What happens to stroke volume when you lower preload? Which type of diuretic will you prescribe? What adverse effects should you watch for? The diuretic will lower preload and reduce stroke volume, ie the patient moves left on the ventricular performance curve. A loop diuretic such as furosemide is typically used for heart failure. Adverse effects include hypokalemia and ototoxicity. Question 9 The next step in treating acute heart failure is to increase stroke volume. What are two interventions that can move the ventricular performance curve up and to the left? Of these interventions, if their blood pressure remains low, which is your best option? Increasing contractility (ie with a beta1 agonist) and lowering afterload (ie with an ACE-inhibitor) will move the curve up and to the left, subsequently increasing stroke volume at any preload. If the patient\\'s blood pressure is low, it is difficult to lower afterload further as they will become hypotensive. In that case, a medication to increase contractility, such as IV dobutamine, is preferred. Question 10 Pick two different drugs to increase inotropy, one oral and one intravenous. What adverse effects should you watch for? Digitalis can be given orally to increase contractility, but the effect is modest. Digitalis toxicity can cause arrhythmias including atrial tachycardia and heart block. Blood tests can used to monitor for toxic levels. Dobutamine is an intravenous alpha1-agonist. As such, it will increase contractility and heart rate. Adverse effects include tachycardia (can occur especially at high doses) and arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia.  4-Answers 5 \\nAfter starting IV dobutamine (inotropic therapy) and receiving IV furosemide (diuretic), the patient looks and feels better. Their heart rate remains elevated at 110 bpm, but they are less cold, and blood pressure is 100/60. A stat echo shows an LVEF of 26%, moderate LV enlargement, mild RV enlargement, systolic dysfunction, and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation with no structural abnormality of the valves. The pulmonary artery pressure is moderately elevated. Question 11 Why is the pulmonary artery pressure elevated? If the tricuspid and mitral valves appear structurally normal, why is there abnormal regurgitation? The LV filling pressure is very high, typically 25 mm Hg or higher with decompensated heart failure due to excess blood volume. This volume backs up into the LA and further back into the pulmonary artery, thereby increasing pressures in these areas. The AV valve regurgitation is related to several factors. Systolic dysfunction means that papillary muscle contraction is impaired, so the valves are not held as tightly closed during systole. Also, enlargement of the ventricles over time can lead to dilation of the valve annulus, and the papillary muscles moving away from each other and further from the valve as the ventricle remodels. The chords are a fixed length, so the valve is \"tethered\" and the leaflets are not able to close effectively. Question 12 You want to start an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to lower afterload. Choose one ACE-inhibitor, one angiotensin receptor blocker, and one neprilysin inhibitor. How do their mechanisms of action differ? Which ones affect bradykinin levels? What adverse effects do you need to watch for? ACE-inhibitors: Lisinopril Mechanism: The ACE enzyme is inhibited resulting in a decrease in angiotensin II levels and an increase in bradykinin levels. The net result is vasodilation and a reduction in afterload. Adverse effects: ACE inhibitors can cause cough and hyperkalemia. Angiotensin II receptor blockers: Losartan. Mechanism: These directly antagonize the effect of angiotensin II.There is no effect on bradykinin levels, so ARBs do not cause cough. Adverse effects: hyperkalemia. Neprilysin inhibitor: Sacubitril Mechanism: Neprilysin degrades natriuretic peptides (NP). By inhibiting this enzyme, NP levels are increased. Bradykinin levels are also increased. The combination of sacubitril with valsartan (an ARB) raises natriuretic peptide and bradykinin levels and antagonizes the RAAS.Adverse effects: cough, hyperkalemia, hypotension 6  4-Answers \\nYour patient improves and is discharged from the hospital after 5 days. Two weeks later, you see them for a follow up appointment in clinic. They report dyspnea when walking rapidly for more than 2 blocks, walking uphill, or climbing more than 1 flight of stairs. They have lost 12 pounds since the last clinic visit. Medications: Enalapril 10 mg twice daily, digoxin 0.125 mg daily, and furosemide 40 mg daily. Physical Exam: Vitals General Cardiovascular Regular rhythm and rate, 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex, soft Afebrile, BP 105/70 mm Hg, HR 85 bpm, RR 16 per minute Sitting up in a chair comfortably S3, JVP 7 cm, warm extremities, no edema Clear to auscultation bilaterally No hepatomegaly Pulmonary Abdomen Question 13 What is the patient\\'s NYHA functional class? Are they in acute or chronic heart failure? Their functional class is II because they experience dyspnea with ordinary activity. Their heart failure is currently compensated as they have no signs of volume overload. Thus, this patient is currently in chronic heart failure. Question 14 What medical therapy would you consider at this visit to antagonize the sympathetic nervous system? Why didn\\'t you start it earlier? What are the potential adverse effects? Now that the patient is euvolemic and clinically improved, a alpha1 blocker can be added. A alpha1 blocker was not started during the initial presentation because, at the time, the negative inotropic effects would have worsened their acute decompensated heart failure. The main difference chronic management of HF is that in chronic HF management, we want to downregulate the neurohormonal RAAS and SNS systems. acute in vsThe alpha1 blockers approved for systolic heart failure are metoprolol, carvedilol, and bisoprolol. Adverse effects of alpha1 blockers include fatigue, bradycardia, depression, and erectile dysfunction.  4-Answers 7 \\nCase 2 An 80 year-old person with a long history of hypertension presents with dyspnea on exertion when carrying groceries into the house, climbing 1 flight of stairs, and walking uphill. The patient has mild, stable ankle edema, and report no orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, nor wheezing. On physical exam: Vital signs: General: Pulmonary: Cardiovascular: Abdominal: Extremities: Afebrile, BP 150/75 mm Hg, HR 80 bpm, RR 14 per minute Sitting up in a chair, appears comfortable. Clear to auscultation Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs. S4 gallop at the apex. PMI non-displaced. JVP 7 cm. Soft, nontender. No hepatomegaly. Warm. 1+ bilateral ankle pitting edema with surrounding skin discoloration consistent with chronic venous stasis. An ECG suggests left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Question 1 Is this presentation systolic or diastolic heart failure? Use the history and physical to support your answer. This is likely diastolic heart failure, also known as heart failure with preserved EF (HFpEF), based on age, history of hypertension, and exam suggesting a non-dilated left ventricle (PMI is normal). The S4 gallop is common in his age group, and it is also a marker of abnormal diastolic function. 8  4-Answers \\nAn echocardiogram shows an LVEF of 65%, mild LV hypertrophy, a normal right heart, and no valve abnormalities. A stress test does not suggest myocardial ischemia. Pulmonary function tests are normal for age. Question 2 Draw a pressure-volume (P-V) loop for this patient and compare it to a normal P-V loop. How do the LVEDP, EDV, ESV, and SV compare to the normal heart? In diastolic heart failure, the EDPVR (end- diastolic pressure-volume relation) curve is shifted upward from curve 1 (normal) to curve 2 (diastolic heart failure). This shift reflects that for a given LV volume, the LV filling pressure is now higher. As a result of the EDPVR shift, LVEDP is increased. This is generally accompanied by a decreased EDV (although EDV can sometimes remain normal). If EDV is decreased, then SV is reduced. Note that if EDV remains normal, SV is normal as well. Because contractility has not changed (as indicated by the ESPVR), ESV is unchanged. In the end, diastolic heart failure is not a problem of inadequate stroke volume, but rather, one of an elevated filling pressure. Question 3 What are this patient\\'s treatment options? A reduction in preload will lower LV filling pressure subsequently improve dyspnea. Hence, diuretics are used in the treatment of diastolic heart failure, especially if the patient is volume overloaded. Also, control of hypertension is an important treatment goal. You will learn more about treating hypertension in the Renal portion of the course.  4-Answers 9 \\n 10  4-Answers \\n CPR - Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 4: Answers to Potassium Cases Part 1: Hyperkalemia Case 1 A 55 year-old woman with ESRD due to polycystic kidney disease who is maintained on HD complains of marked weakness.

He attends his PCP for a routine checkup. Exam: P 64, BP 132/78, chest clear, no JVD, no edema. Laboratory values are as follows: Na K Cl CO2 138 5.7 105 23 BUN Creatinine 32 3.5 Normal Values Na: 135-145 mmol/L K: 3.6-5.0 mmol/L Cl: 98-108 mmol/L HCO3: 22-30 mmol/L BUN: 8-12mg/dl Creatinine 0.7-1.2mg/dl Case 3 a. How does the kidney excrete potassium? Briefly, potassium is filtered at the glomerulus and largely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule and loop of Henle. The control of potassium excretion occurs in the cortical collecting duct. Here, Na is reabsorbed by the epithelial Na channel (ENaC), which sets up a lumen negative net charge allowing secretion of potassium into the tubular fluid via ROMK.Three factors are therefore required for potassium excretion 1. A GFR 2. Distal delivery of Na and H2O to the cortical collecting duct 3. Aldosterone b. How does the high potassium level aid in the excretion of potassium? Hyperkalemia directly stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Hyperkalemia also upregulates ENaC, ROMK, and Na/K- ATPase independent of aldosterone. c. What factors may contribute to hyperkalemia in this individual? 1. CKD (His decreased GFR impairs his ability to excrete potassium) 2. Blood sugar. Note we are not given his blood sugar. Hyperglycemia draws potassium out of cells and can cause or exacerbate hyperkalemia 3. Medications. He has hypertension and probable diabetic kidney disease and he is likely to be on an ACE inhibitor (or angiotensin receptor blocker). These inhibit downstream aldosterone and are associated with hyperkalemia. Medications are a common cause of hyperK (see syllabus chapter: Potassium Disorders) 2  3 Answers \\n A 49 year-old woman sees her physician because of weakness, easy fatigability, and loss of appetite. During the past month she has lost 7 kg (15 lb.). On physical examination she is found to have hyperpigmentation especially of the oral mucosa and gums. Her blood pressure falls when she assumes an upright posture (BP = 100/60 mm Hg supine & 80/50 mm Hg erect). The following laboratory data are obtained: Serum Na Serum K Urine Na 132 mmol/L (nl = 135 - 147 mmol/L) 6.5 mmol/L (nl = 3.5 - 5.0 mmol/L) 20 mmol/L (nl = depends on Na+ and H2O intake) The plasma level of what hormone(s) would be expected to be below normal in this patient? This woman\\'s symptoms and the electrolyte disturbances are most characteristic of decreased levels of aldosterone. This is a patient who has Addison\\'s disease. The presence of hyperpigmentation suggests that the primary problem is at the level of the adrenal gland (i.e., non-responsive to ACTH). In the setting of low glucocorticoid, the loss of negative feedback stimulates corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) leading to increased ACTH and POMC (proopiomelanocortin ). POMC acts on epidermal melanocytes leading to the hyperpigmentation of the gums and skin. Why is the serum K level elevated? Why is the serum Na low? The electrolyte disturbances in adrenal insufficiency are due to reduction in the secretion of cortisol and aldosterone. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are the two major manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. Hyperkalemia. A major function of aldosterone is to increase urinary potassium secretion. Aldosterone stimulates Na reabsorption in the CCD (via ENaC) resulting in increased K secretion. Aldosterone deficiency results in reduced K+ secretion, and therefore plasma [K+] increases. Hyponatremia is found in 85 to 90 percent of patients with adrenal insufficiency. The hyponatremia is predominantly due to glucocorticoid deficiency. Under physiologic conditions, cortisol exerts negative feedback on corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) in the thalamus. This hormone is an ADH secretagogue. When cortisol levels are low, CRH levels rise and cause increased secretion of ADH from the posterior pituitary. Case 4 A 24 year old man with no prior medical history is airlifted to hospital after a car accident. He sustained multiple fractures and crush injury. His urine is noted to be cola colored and urine output is low. Labs: Urinalysis: 3+ blood, no RBCs, 1+ protein.

What factors cause potassium to shift out of cells Potassium may shift out of cells due to: a) Hyperglycemia. Increased osmolality in the ECV leads to water being drawn out of cells, and K+ follows by solvent drag. b) Cell necrosis (eg hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis) and may be associated with elevations in other cellular components (LDH, muscle enzymes such as creatinine kinase) c) Fasting. This decreases basal insulin levels and may reduce insulin stimulated d) Acidosis. In some forms of acidosis, H+ ions move intracellularly in exchange for K+ cellular K uptake. ions. 2.) What is the likely etiology of this man\\'s hyperkalemia? Rhabdomyolysis: Car accident and crush leads to marked muscle injury and release of intracellular contents into serum. High CK (50,000) highly suggestive of rhabdo. Also note creatinine level is elevated (2.0) suggesting he has acute kidney injury (possibly 2nd to rhabdo) and impairment of potassium excretion. 3.) How should the hyperkalemia in this man be treated? This level is a medical emergency. EKG should be checked and he should be treated with immediate IV calcium gluconate and IV insulin/dextrose. The mainstay of treatment for rhabdomyolysis is fluid resuscitation to prevent pigment nephropathy. If his urine output is not robust, he may require mechanical methods of K removal such as dialysis. You see a patient in clinic for hypertension. He has a strong family history of HTN, early coronary artery disease, and stroke. BP 140/98. The plasma [K] = 4.0mmol/L.You encourage a low Na+ diet, and advise him to increase his exercise and reduce his alcohol consumption. Despite his lifestyle changes, he remains hypertensive and you prescribe a thiazide diuretic. Three weeks later, The BP = 133/84; his serum [K] = 2.9. Where do thiazides work in the nephron? Thiazides act on the distal convoluted tubule which is upstream of the nephron where K+ is secreted (K+ secretion occurs in the late distal tubule and cortical portion of the collecting duct). What is the mechanism by which thiazides cause hypokalemia? There are two main factors: (increased distal delivery of Na and increased aldosterone) 1) By inhibiting Na reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule, increased Na and H2O are delivered to the K secreting sites (late distal tubule and cortical collecting duct (CCD). This in turn stimulates K+ secretion by the principal cells. 2) Thiazides may cause ECV depletion. In contrast, the K+-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene and amiloride) prevent K+ loss in the urine by inhibiting Na reabsorption in the CCD, and inhibiting K secretion. 54 year-old man with history of alcohol abuse enters hospital with vomiting over past 4 days. Past history unreliable, but known to have history of duodenal ulcer and episodes of prolonged vomiting in past. On examination, temp 37, pulse 130, respirations 20, blood pressure 104/70 with significant orthostatic drop. Weight 68Kg (normal wt 70kg). Disorientated, poor skin turgor. Heart and lungs clear. Abd soft, non tender. What features suggest this man is volume depleted? The features suggesting volume depletion can be determined from the history, examination and laboratory investigations. Examination is the key determinant of volume status. a. History: He has a clear history of vomiting. He may also describe thirst, weakness and lightheadedness. b. Examination: He has a low blood pressure (postural drop in blood pressure); tachycardia; poor skin turgor and acute weight loss (2kg). Also note the absence of signs of volume overload (edema, raised jugular venous pressure, pulmonary edema (crackles)). c. Laboratory: He has a raised BUN: creatinine ratio, a hypokalemic alkalosis and renal impairment (pre-renal) all of which are in keeping with volume depletion, but are not specific. 2.) Why does this man have low serum potassium? Hypokalemia in vomiting. At first thought this seems obvious that he is losing potassium in his emesis, however, gastric secretions only contain a small amount of potassium (5-10mmol/L) (note diarrhea can have a much higher potassium concentration (35-60mmol/L). The main reason for hypokalemia is potassium wasting by the kidneys. Two main factors contribute to this: volume depletion stimulates the production of aldosterone and sodium delivery to the distal nephron is maintained by distal NaHCO3 delivery. The high filtered load of bicarbonate (high serum bicarbonate) exceeds the ability of the proximal tubule to reabsorb all the filtered NaHCO3 and some is spilled in the urine (high urine pH) 3.) Why does a very low potassium diet not lead to hypokalemia? The kidney is very efficient as holding on to potassium (urine K < 15mmol/L) in settings of low potassium intake. A low potassium intake is therefore never the sole cause for hypokalemia. Mechanisms include: a. Decreased K secretion in cortical collecting duct. Hypokalemia inhibits the production of aldosterone inhibiting K secretion. Increased K reabsorption due to increased H-K-ATPase activity in intercalated cells, \\xadluminal area of intercalated cells, and apical surface redistribution of Na-K-ATPase expression in outer medullary collecting duct. 1. Compare and contrast the internal features of the four chambers of the heart and relate them to their physiological function and precursors in the fetal heart. Identify the atrioventricular and semilunar valves and describe their functions. 2. 3. Review the flow of blood in sequence through the heart. 4. Describe the components and physical locations of the heart\\'s conducting system. 5. Define the terms systole and diastole and relate these concepts to internal heart anatomy. The heart can be conceptualized as two pumps working side by side. Each of these pumps has a receiving chamber and a pumping chamber-the atria and ventricles, respectively-making four chambers in total. Deoxygenated blood is drained into the right atrium from the SVC, IVC, and coronary sinus. From there, blood enters the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary trunk and pulmonary arteries to the lungs. After oxygenation in the lungs, blood returns to the left atrium through the four pulmonary veins, two from each lung. From there, blood enters the left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the entire systemic circulation. The heart wall consists of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The epicardium or visceral layer of serous pericardium (the two terms mean the same thing) covers the external surface of the heart. There is often epicardial fat present deep to the epicardium. The myocardium is the relatively thick middle layer that consists of cardiac muscle. The endocardium is the inner layer of the heart wall. It is continuous with the endothelium, the simple squamous epithelium lining the blood vessels. Figure 2. Layers of the heart.\\n\\nThe atria only need to contract hard enough to push blood to an adjacent ventricle, so the myocardium of these upper chambers is thinner. Recall from the Anatomy & Embryology of the Heart chapter that the atria have rough portions from the primitive atrium and smooth portions from the incorporation of primitive vessels. The two atria are separated by the interatrial septum, which developed as the septum primum and septum secundum. The ventricles also have rough portions-from primitive ventricle on the left and bulbus cordis on the right-and smooth portions from distal bulbus cordis. In the ventricles, the rough and smooth portions correspond to the inflow and outflow portions of the chambers, respectively. The two ventricles are separated by the interventricular septum, with its muscular and membranous portions. The inflow portions of the ventricles are separated from the atria by the atrioventricular valves- tricuspid and mitral-that cover the atrioventricular orifices to prevent regurgitation of blood into the atria when the ventricles contract (Figure 3). The outflow portions of the ventricles direct blood toward semilunar valves-pulmonic and aortic-that open into the corresponding great vessels (Figure 3). The individual valves are discussed in greater detail in the following section. The valves of the heart are attached to a framework of dense connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton (Figure 3). It consists of four fibrous rings-one for each of the valves-and lies within the myocardium deep to the coronary sulcus between the atria and the ventricles. In addition to (1) providing support for the valves, the cardiac skeleton (2) provides a framework for the attachment of cardiac muscle and (3) insulates a part of the conducting system known as the atrioventricular bundle (see Conducting System section below). Figure 3. Cardiac skeleton and valves of the heart. The cardiac skeleton provides support for the two atrioventricular valves-tricuspid and mitral-and the two semilunar valves-pulmonary and aortic. The cusps of the valves are labeled (A = anterior, P = posterior, L = left, R = right). Note the opening of the left and right coronary arteries in the left and right aortic sinuses, respectively. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 2 \\nINTERNAL FEATURES OF THE HEART CHAMBERS We will now cover the special features of each heart chamber beginning with the right atrium and progressing in the order of blood flow. As blood follows this path, it will pass through four important valves that prevent regurgitation or backflow of blood. The valves are discussed below with their associated ventricles. RIGHT ATRIUM The crista terminalis is a C-shaped ridge that divides the interior of the right atrium into smooth and rough parts (Figure 4). The sinus venarum is the smooth portion posterior to the crista terminalis into which the SVC and IVC drain. Recall that the sinus venarum is smooth due to its origin from the embryonic sinus venosus, with further contribution from the SVC and IVC.The walls of the right atrium anterior to the crista terminalis are rough due to the ridged pectinate muscles. Recall that this part of the chamber is derived from the primitive atrium. The right auricle (right auricular appendage) is a projection of the rough portion of the atrium that rests on the aortic trunk. The interatrial septum separates the right and left atria. The fossa ovalis-a remnant of the embryonic foramen ovale-is visible on the interatrial septum as a thumb-sized depression just superior to the orifice of the IVC (Figure 4). The coronary sinus drains into the right atrium just anterior to the crista terminalis near this location. Figure 4. Right atrium CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 3 \\nClinical correlate: The tricuspid valve is the most commonly involved valve in cases of infective endocarditis caused by intravenous drug abuse. Infection in of any valve will cause large vegetations to grow on the cusps or attached chordae tendinae. RIGHT VENTRICLE The right atrioventricular valve, commonly referred to as the tricuspid valve, surrounds the right atrioventricular orifice to prevent regurgitation of blood from the right ventricle back into the right atrium (Figures 3-5). The tricuspid valve has three cusps named according to their positions: anterior, posterior, and septal. In the right ventricle, the rough inflow portion contains corresponding nipple-like projections termed papillary muscles: anterior, posterior, and septal (Figure 5). Each cusp of the tricuspid valve is attached to the apex of two papillary muscles by the chordae tendinae, tendinous cords. During ventricular contractions, the papillary muscles also contract, preventing the atrioventricular valves from being everted (like an umbrella in the wind). In addition to the papillary muscles, the inflow portion of the right ventricle is rough due to the presence of trabeculae carneae, rod-like fascicles of cardiac muscle (Figure 5). The septomarginal trabecula (or moderator band) is a specialized trabecula that carries part of the conducting system from the interventricular septum to the anterior papillary muscle (see the Conducting System section below). Recall the inflow portion of the right ventricle is derived from proximal bulbus cordis. The infundibulum (or conus cordis) is the smooth outflow portion of the right ventricle that directs blood superiorly to the pulmonary trunk. Recall the infundibulum is derived from distal bulbus cordis. Figure 5. Right ventricle CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 4 \\nThe pulmonary semilunar valve (or simply pulmonary/pulmonic valve) lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary trunk (Figures 3 & 5). It has three cusps: anterior, right, and left. Just above each cusp, the wall of the pulmonary trunk is slightly dilated. A pulmonary sinus is formed between this portion of dilated pulmonary trunk and each cusp of the pulmonic valve. As the ventricular contraction ceases, blood begins to flow back toward the ventricles. This flow quickly fills the pulmonary sinuses and causes the cusps of the pulmonic valve to close, preventing regurgitation of blood from the pulmonary trunk back into the right ventricle. Clinical correlate: The left atrium makes up the base of the heart near the esophagus. Therefore, this chamber-and potential clots within it-are visualized very well with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). LEFT ATRIUM After traveling from the pulmonary trunk to the pulmonary arteries and being oxygenated in the pulmonary capillaries, blood returns to the left atrium through the four pulmonary veins, two on each side. Most of the wall of the left atrium is smooth, having been formed by the incorporation of the pulmonary veins during development (Figure 6). The left auricle (left auricular appendage) is a small anterior portion of the left atrium with rough walls due to the presence of pectinate muscle. Figure 6. Left atrium and ventricle. Note the difference in myocardial thickness between the two chambers. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 5 \\nLEFT VENTRICLE The left atrioventricular valve (or bicuspid valve) is commonly referred to as the mitral valve due to its resemblance to a bishop\\'s mitre (hat; Figures 3 & 6). It surrounds the left atrioventricular orifice to prevent regurgitation of blood from the left ventricle back into the left atrium. The mitral valve has two cusps, anterior and posterior, which are connected to anterior and posterior papillary muscles in the left ventricle by chordae tendinae. Clinical correlate: The mitral valve-which is often described as having a \"fish mouth\" appearance (see right)-is the most commonly affected valve in cases of chronic rheumatic heart disease, likely due to the increased mechanical stress on the valve as the powerful left ventricle contracts. Typically, the cusps of the mitral valve become fused as the disease progresses. . The left ventricle has the thickest myocardium of any heart chamber, reflecting the fact that it\\'s responsible for pumping blood through the whole systemic circuit (Figure 6). Recall that the rough inflow portion of the left ventricle with trabeculae carneae is derived from primitive ventricle (different embryonic origin from the inflow portion of the right ventricle). The aortic vestibule is the smooth outflow portion of the heart that directs blood superiorly to the ascending aorta. Recall that the aortic vestibule is derived from distal bulbus cordis (same origin as the infundibulum of the right ventricle). The aortic semilunar valve (or simply aortic valve) lies between the aortic vestibule and the ascending aorta and has a similar form and function as the pulmonic valve (Figures 3 & 6). The aortic valve has three cusps: right, left, and posterior (compare this to the pulmonic valve, which has right, left, and anterior cusps). Each cusp forms an aortic sinus (of Valsalva) with the walls of the aorta. Backflow of blood after ventricular contraction ceases quickly fills the sinuses, causing the aortic valve to close and preventing regurgitation of blood back into the left ventricle. The right and left coronary arteries originate in the right and left aortic sinuses, respectively. This design allows the coronary arteries to be supplied by backflowing blood in the aortic sinuses when the ventricular myocardium is relaxed, rather than trying to pump blood into coronary arteries that are being compressed by contracted myocardium. Clinical correlate: Valves may calcify with age through the process of sclerosis. If sclerosis causes a narrowing or thickening of the valve that reduces its function, then the condition is known as stenosis. The aortic valve is most commonly affected (pictured at right), making aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis the most commonly performed surgical valve procedure. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 6 \\nCARDIAC CYCLE The cardiac cycle, or heartbeat, pumps blood through the heart and the pulmonary and systemic circuits. We will now consider the actions of the chambers and valves during the cardiac cycle as well as the conducting system that regulates the dynamic actions of the heart. DIASTOLE AND SYSTOLE The cardiac cycle is divided into two periods according to the activity of the ventricles (Figure 7). Diastole is the period of ventricular filling (think diastole = dilate). Systole is the period of ventricular contraction. Note that the atria undergo atrial diastole and atrial systole, but these are separate from the true diastole and systole referenced in the cardiac cycle. In diastole, when the ventricles are filling, the atrioventricular valves are open while the semilunar valves are passively closed by the backflow of blood. In systole, contraction of the ventricles forces the semilunar valves open and the atrioventricular valves closed. The papillary muscles contract simultaneously with the ventricles, pulling on the chordae tendinae to prevent eversion of the atrioventricular valves during systole. In a healthy functioning heart, the approximate periods of systole and diastole are audible as the first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2. S1 is the \"lub\" sound made by the closure of the atrioventricular valves at the start of systole. S2 is the \"dub\" sound made by the semilunar valves at the end of systole and the start of diastole. Figure 7. Summary of diastole and systole Clinical correlate: The sounds of the individual valves closing are best heard at defined auscultation sites \"downstream\" of the valve. These sites are tricuspid area (left 5th intercostal space parasternally), pulmonic area (left 2nd intercostal space parasternally), mitral area (left 5th intercostal space mid-clavicularly), and aortic area (right 2nd intercostal space parasternally). When the valves aren\\'t functioning properly, characteristic systolic or diastolic murmurs are heard at these sites. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 7 \\nCONDUCTING SYSTEM The cardiac cycle is influenced by both divisions of the autonomic nervous system. Parasympathetic innervation decreases the heart rate while sympathetic innervation increases the heart rate and the force of contraction. It is important to understand that these nerve inputs do not initiate or maintain the heartbeat, exemplified by the fact that transplanted hearts continue to beat regularly despite the fact that the autonomic nerve supply has been transected. The coordination of the cardiac cycle is performed by specialized cardiac muscle cells comprising the conducting system of the heart (Figure 8). These myocytes conduct impulses in an autorhythmic manner throughout the rest of the myocardium to signal contraction. The conducting system of the heart comprises the sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node, and atrioventricular bundle and its branches. The sinoatrial (SA) node functions as the heart\\'s pacemaker, which spontaneously generates a baseline heart rate of approximately 70 impulses per minute. It is located in the wall of the right atrium near where the superior portion of the crista terminalis adjoins the SVC.The autonomic nervous system influences the conducting system of the heart to increase or decrease the heart rate at the SA node. The atrioventricular (AV) node is the part of the conducting system that connects the atria to the ventricles, which are otherwise electrically isolated. It lies in the interatrial septum near the septal cusp of the tricuspid valve. After the AV node receives an electrical signal from the SA node, the AV node propogates the signal through the atrioventricular bundle (of His), which is insulated by the cardiac skeleton. In the interventricular septum, the atrioventricular bundle branches into left and right bundle branches that extend toward the apex of the heart. These branches enter the walls of the corresponding ventricle along the trabeculae carneae, including the septomarginal trabecula on the right. Both branches terminate in the myocardium as Purkinje fibers (subendocardial branches). Figure 8.

CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Interior of the Heart 9 \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 3: Mechanics Day: 7 Hours: 3 and 4 Question 1 Cardioselective L-type calcium channel blockers are a class of drugs frequently used in heart disease. What effect do these drugs have on heart rate? What effect do they have on myocardial contractility? Explain the mechanism of your answers. L-type calcium channel blockers will slow Phase 0 of the pacemaker action potential by blocking these ion channels. This leads to longer time to depolarization, and thus slower conduction. Slower conducted beats results in a lower heart rate. Also, by blocking the L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma, less calcium is able to enter the cell during Phase 2 of the myocyte action potential. This means less calcium is available to bind to Troponin C, as well as less calcium to trigger calcium induced calcium release. This decrease in calcium means less tension is developed during contraction, thus decreasing myocardial contractility. Note that now there is also less calcium available for uptake by the SERCA for future release. This also contributes to the decrease in contractility.  3-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 Draw the Frank-Starling curve. In a patient with no other abnormalities, how does the curve shift with exercise and why? With exercise, contractility increases by virtue of the increase in heart rate which increases intracellular calcium. Contractility also increases from the increased sympathetic nervous system activity. Afterload decreases with skeletal muscle vasodilatation. As a result, the curve moves up and to the left. Note that venous return is also increased by the pumping action of exercising muscles. This allows the end-diastolic volume and pressure (preload) to be maintained despite the increased heart rate. Question 3 How does the administration of dobutamine affect cardiac muscle tension and shortening velocity? Use the length-tension relationship and the force-velocity relationship to justify your answer. Dobutamine increases cardiac contractility, and thus increases the magnitude of active tension generated at any given sarcomere length. This is illustrated in the figure below on the left. The increase in contractility also moves the force-velocity curve up and to the right, so shortening velocity increases (ie is faster) for a given afterload. This is illustrated in the figure on the right. 2  3-Answers \\nQuestion 4 Draw a pressure-volume loop for a normal left ventricle. Label the following: 1. Systole and diastole 2. Isovolumetric contraction and relaxation 3. Where the mitral and aortic valves open and close. How are preload, afterload, and contractility represented on the loop? What is the ejection fraction (EF)? Systole is the section of the loop from where the MV closes to the AV opening to the AV closing. Diastole is the section of the loop from where the AV closes to the MV opening to the MV closing. Preload is represented by the End Diastolic Volume (EDV). Afterload is represented by the upper curve of the loop (from AV opening to AV closing) and its value changes over this time, ending at the end-systolic pressure. Contractility is represented by the end-systolic pressure-volume relation (ESPVR) line. Its intersection with the loop indicates where contraction stops. The EF is (EDV-ESV)/EDV, or simply SV/EDV. 3-Answers 3 \\nQuestion 5 Draw the change in ventricular volume during the cardiac cycle. Describe where rapid ventricular ejection and rapid ventricular filling occur in relation to the phases of systole and diastole, respectively. Blood is ejected most rapidly from the ventricle during the first half of the ejection phase (Phase C) in systole. Aortic pressure falls in the last part of systolic ejection (Phase D) as ventricular contraction wanes. Rapid ventricular filling occurs passively during early diastole (Phase F) as blood that accumulated in the atrium during ejection empties rapidly into the ventricle. 4  3-Answers \\nQuestion 6 For the ECG complex below, which valves close at time point 2? Which time point corresponds to atrial contraction? Why is the ECG flat at point 3? Case 1 The mitral and tricuspid valves close at the onset of ventricular contraction at point 2. Atrial contraction occurs at time point 1, just after the P wave which indicates atrial depolarization. Point 3 (the ST segment) is flat because all the ventricular myocardial cells are at the same membrane potential during ventricular contraction. A 70 year-old patient is evaluated for worsening shortness of breath. Their stroke volume is determined by echocardiography to be very low, with a low ejection fraction (EF) indicating poor ventricular systolic function. Draw an estimate of the patient\\'s ventricular performance curve compared to that of a normal heart. Based on what you have learned about mechanics thus far, what strategies could be used to increase the stroke volume? With depressed systolic function, the ventricular function curve is shifted from normal to down and to the right (blue curve). The curve can be moved back up and to the left by increasing contractility, decreasing afterload, or doing both. These interventions increase stroke volume for any level of preload. Note that increasing preload would not significantly increase stroke volume since a heart with poor ventricular function typically operates on the flatter part of the curve where changes in preload result in minimal, if any, increase stroke volume.  3-Answers 5 \\nCase 2 For each clinical scenario, draw the effect of the intervention on a pressure-volume loop and state the effect on stroke volume. A.A patient who is dehydrated receives 2L of intravenous fluid. B.A patient with hypotension is given phenylephrine. C.Dobutamine is administered to a patient in acute heart failure. D.A patient starts a regimen of furosemide and lisinopril to treat chronic heart failure. E.A patient inadvertently takes a dose of doxazosin. F.A patient initiates spironolactone. A.IV fluid will increase intravascular volume, and thus preload. SV increases. B.Phenylephrine increases afterload, thus decreasing SV.C.Dobutamine increases contractility, creating a steeper ESPVR, allowing for greater ventricular emptying. Thus, SV increases. D.Furosemide decreases intravascular volume and thus, preload. Lisinopril decreases afterload. Depending on the degree of the effect of each, these interventions could balance out with no change in SV.E.Doxazosin decreases afterload, thus increasing SV.F.Spironolactone is a diuretic, so it decreases preload, thus decreasing SV.6  3-Answers \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 10: Congenital Heart Disease Day: 14 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 12 year-old patient is seen for a routine well-child check. Their mother says they are generally well but has had multiple upper respiratory infections. On examination, this child is in no distress and has normal appearance and development. Blood pressure is 105/60 mm Hg and heart rate 89 beats/min. There is a Grade 2/6, blowing, systolic murmur heard best at the left upper sternal border with a fixed split S2. The patient has no cyanosis, clubbing or jugular venous distention and the lungs fields are clear. Question 1 What is your provisional diagnosis? The diagnosis is most likely an atrial septal defect (ASD). Less likely diagnoses include pulmonic valve stenosis, however the murmur described is not typical of this. A small VSD could be possible but would not explain the fixed splitting of S2. Question 2 What is the next most appropriate diagnostic test? What are you looking for with this study? An echocardiogram should be performed. The goals of the echo are to: Determine the type of atrial septal defect (secundum, primum, sinus venosus, or coronary sinus) Determine the size of the defect Look for evidence of right atrial and right ventricular dilation Look for evidence of associated congenital abnormalities Estimate the pulmonary artery pressure since pulmonary arterial hypertension is a contraindication to closure.  10-Answers 1 \\nAfter the appropriate diagnostic test is performed, the child is sent for left and right heart catheterization. The results are as follows: Source Pressure (mm Hg) Oxygen Saturation (%) Mixed venous taken from vena cava Pulmonary venous Right atrium Right ventricle 3 25/8 Pulmonary artery 25/12, mean=16 Left atrium Left ventricle Aorta Question 3 8 85/5 85/65 75% 100% 85% 90% 90% 100% 100% 100% How do you interpret these results? What information do they give us about the diagnosis? The data shows normal right atrial pressure, mildly elevated pulmonary pressures, and normal left atrial pressure. The oximetry shows that there is a \"step-up\" from the mixed venous to the pulmonary artery saturation from 75% to 90%. We want to use the PA saturation, not the RV saturation, to allow for a downstream mixing chamber to allow the blood to homogenize to make sure we are not getting streaming artifact. This step-up shows that there is a left to right shunt. The fact that there is no step-down from the pulmonary veins to the aorta shows that there is no right to left shunt. Question 4 Is there more blood flow going through the pulmonary circulation or through the systemic circulation? Because blood from the left side of the heart is going to both the right side of the heart and to the systemic circulation, there is more blood flow going through the lungs than through the systemic circulation. Notably, the left ventricle is left relatively underfilled as part of the left atrial flow is going to the right atrium, rather than all to the left ventricle. 2  10-Answers \\nQuestion 5 Based on the oximetry data above, Q p: Q s = 2.5. Using the Fluid Flow equation, what can you say about the relationship between pulmonary flow, pressure, and resistance in this patient? Recall that Q𝑝̇ = ΔP R  = PAP - LAP PVR where LAP is left atrial pressure, PAP is pulmonary artery pressure, and PVR is pulmonary vascular resistance. In this patient, catheterization pressures show only a mildly elevated PAP. Thus, to accommodate an increase in Q𝑝̇ , PVR has decreased. One of the ways PVR decreases is from dilation of the pulmonary vasculature due to the high pulmonary blood flow. Recall that R  = 8L𝜂/𝜋r4. Since resistance in inversely proportional to the radius to the fourth power, PVR drops considerably in this setting. In addition, the increased pulmonary blood flow opens underutilized and previously closed pulmonary vessels. This vasculature is added in parallel leading to a fall in overall resistance. This concept will be covered in greater detail in the Pulmonary portion of the course. Question 6 What treatment would you recommend at this time? What rationale would you provide to the parents regarding the need for the procedure? The ASD needs to be closed. The patient has a large left to right shunt, and their PVR is low enough that closure is safe. If the ASD were left open, then it would lead to progressive RV dilation, subsequent RV dysfunction, atrial arrhythmias, and rarely pulmonary arterial hypertension. If the patient develops pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), then the defect is not repairable. PAH and Eisenmenger syndrome are less common in ASD than in VSD or PDA because the lungs are only exposed to high flow, rather than both high pressure and high flow.  10-Answers 3 \\nCase 2 A newborn who was delivered at term was doing well after birth until the second day, when they were was noted to be pale, tachypneic, and feeding poorly. An arterial blood gas was obtained which demonstrated a metabolic acidosis. Question 1 If this problem is related to a congenital heart defect, what types of defect could cause this constellation of problems? Since the newborn deteriorated on day 2, the defect is most likely a ductal dependent lesion. The ductus arteriosus must have been hiding the underlying defect by allowing communication between the systemic and pulmonary circulations. The natural closure of the ductus on the first day will unmask the defect. Important diagnoses to consider in this situation are transposition of the great arteries, Tetralogy of Fallot, severe pulmonic stenosis, severe aortic stenosis, and coarctation of the aorta (Syllabus Table 15-4). Question 2 What other information from the history, exam, and laboratory studies do you want at this time? In addition to inquiring about maternal illness, exposures during pregnancy, and family history of congenital heart disease, it is important to check the oxygen saturation and blood pressure of the newborn, and examine for cyanosis, increased respiratory effort, and impaired distal perfusion. Absent pulses in the lower extremities are suggestive of coarctation of the aorta. Auscultating for a murmur is also helpful. A murmur is usually absent in transposition of the great arteries but is found with all of the other diagnostic possibilities listed above. Tetralogy of Fallot and pulmonic stenosis warrant consideration when the murmur is loudest in the pulmonic region (left upper sternal border), whereas coarctation can often be appreciated when auscultating from the patient\\'s back (note however that pulmonic murmurs can radiate to the back as well). Aortic stenosis is appreciated best at the right upper sternal border and radiates to the neck. On examination, the infant is pale and breathing rapidly, with increased effort. You are unable to palpate femoral pulses and notice the feet appear dusky. You hear a systolic murmur at the left sternal border and when auscultating the patient\\'s back. Question 3 Among the items on the differential, what do you think is the most likely? From the differential diagnosis listed above, coarctation of the aorta is the most likely diagnosis given the murmur description and absent femoral pulses. The latter is because blood flow that occurs distal to the coarctation was dependent on the ductus flow. With ductus closure, this flow has decreased. 4  10-Answers \\nQuestion 4 What intervention can you provide for initial stabilization of the infant? What is the definitive therapy? For neonates with critical coarctation of the aorta, prostaglandin E1 should be given intravenously to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus until the patient can undergo definitive corrective surgery. In older children, balloon angioplasty can be performed as well as stenting of the lesion. In babies, surgery is the standard of care. Question 5 Assuming the patient undergoes successful definitive therapy, what are the expected long-term outcomes and potential long-term complications from this congenital defect? Long-term outcomes following successful treatment of coarctation of the aorta are good. Long- term complications include re-coarctation of the aorta, systemic hypertension (due to stiffening of the proximal arteries), and aortic aneurysm formation (typically at the site of the prior coarctation).  10-Answers 5 \\nCase 3 A 37 year-old patient presents to your clinic with cough and intermittent scant hemoptysis. On past medical history, they describe a \"hole\" in their heart at birth, but their parents declined surgery at the time. The patient reports no significant dyspnea or chest pain. On examination heart rate is 77 bpm, blood pressure 102/50 mm Hg, oxygen saturation 84% while breathing ambient air. There is perioral cyanosis. Cardiac exam demonstrates a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, and loud P2. No murmurs are heard. Question 1 What is the cause of this patient\\'s cyanosis? This is most likely due to right-to-left shunting from Eisenmenger syndrome - where a left-to- right shunt (usually VSD, PDA, or more rarely ASD) increases pulmonary blood flow resulting in pulmonary vascular remodeling, severe pulmonary hypertension, and ultimately reversal of the shunt to right-to-left. Note, murmurs of a VSD or PDA are not always present in patients with severe pulmonary hypertension. Question 2 Given the severity of the patient\\'s disease, why do they not report any symptoms? Many patients with congenital heart disease have not known anything different and report that this is \"normal for them.\" They have never had a normal heart so do not feel limited and self- regulate their own activity to match their ability. Question 3 What blood tests would you perform? What are the most likely potential complications of the abnormal result? A hemoglobin should be checked and will likely reveal a marked secondary erythrocytosis (hemoglobin ~20 g/dL and hematocrit ~60%). Risks of such a high hemoglobin include blood hyperviscosity leading to vessel occlusion and iron deficiency. Prophylactic phlebotomy is not indicated but can be used for symptoms caused by hyperviscosity that do not improve with hydration. 6  10-Answers \\nAn echocardiogram is performed and confirms your diagnosis. Based on the results you perform a heart catheterization and receive the following results: Source Pressure (mm Hg) Oxygen Saturation (%) Mixed venous Pulmonary venous Right atrium Right ventricle 10 105/10 Pulmonary artery 105/60, mean=75 Left atrium Left ventricle Aorta 12 105/12 110/80 52% 95% 54% 55% 54% 95% 88% 83% Question 4 Based on the above results, do you recommend surgery? Why or why not? Surgery is not recommended. The findings show an elevated pulmonary artery pressure indicating severe pulmonary hypertension. This likely caused the right-to-left shunt that is demonstrated by the oxygen saturation decline from the left atrium (95%) to the aorta (83%). Surgery in the context of Eisenmenger syndrome is lethal. Question 5 What are the long-term complications of this condition? Secondary erythrocytosis and hyperviscosity syndrome Ventricular failure from pulmonary hypertension Stroke (emboli that would typically be filtered in the pulmonary vasculature now bypass this system to the systemic circulation and are able to reach the brain) Iron deficiency (from the increased production of hemoglobin)   Hemoptysis (from the severe pulmonary hypertension) Question 6 What effect would you expect if you gave this patient supplemental oxygen? Very little (or no) improvement in oxygen saturation. The hallmark of right-to-left shunt mediated hypoxemia is that it is oxygen nonresponsive because significant portion of blood flow bypasses the lungs. Note that the pulmonary venous saturation is already normal at 95%  10-Answers 7 \\nCase 4 An 8 year-old child who has had minimal access to medical care presents for a routine well-child check. The patient was delivered at term with no complications after birth. You note from their growth chart that they are small for their age. On exam: Question 1 General: Vitals: CV: Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes/rhonchi/rales In no acute distress, lips have a slight blue tint HR 90 bpm, RR 26 breaths/min, O2Sat 88% (Right hand and foot) Blood Pressure: RUE 95/50, LUE 96/52, RLE 97/53, LLE 98/53. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, diminished S2 3/6 systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur at the LUSB.3/6 holosystolic murmur at the LLSB radiating to the RLSB.2+ Bilateral upper and lower extremity pulses If this problem is related to a congenital heart defect, what type of defect could cause this constellation of problems? Evidence of cyanosis on the patient\\'s physical exam indicates the presence of a right-to-left shunt. The murmur is consistent with a VSD, however, these are usually left-to-right shunts. Because he has survived past infanthood, it is not transposition of the great arteries, but could be Tetralogy of Fallot. Question 2 What diagnostic tests are appropriate at this time? What are you looking for? Because the patient has a low oxygen saturation, a chest radiograph is an appropriate first step to evaluate for a pulmonary etiology. The murmurs are grade 3 and radiate which indicates that they are likely pathological. Thus, an echocardiogram is appropriate to both diagnose the cause of the murmur and to evaluate for other causes of low oxygen saturation. 8  10-Answers \\nThe chest radiograph shows a large \"boot shaped\" cardiac silhouette (heart shadow). The echocardiogram shows Tetralogy of Fallot. Question 3 In the diagram below, draw and label the blood flow and abnormalities of Tetralogy of Fallot. 1) Pulmonic Stenosis 2) Overriding aorta 3) VSD 4) RVH The parents report that the patient will frequently turn blue when crying or when playing outside, and then will often squat to relieve this problem. Question 4 Why does the patient squat after exertion? This is classic description of a \"cyanotic spell,\" also known as a \"tet spell.\" During exertion, there is a drop in peripheral resistance which results in increased right-to-left shunting, thereby increasing cyanosis. Children with untreated Tetralogy of Fallot instinctively squat during these circumstances to increase their peripheral vascular resistance and thus decrease the level of right-to-left shunting. Note that this finding is rare in the current era because Tetralogy of Fallot is repaired before children are old enough to squat.  10-Answers 9 \\nQuestion 5 What treatment would you recommend at this time? What are the complications of this treatment? Treatment of Tetralogy of Fallot consists of surgical repair. The VSD is closed with a patch, and the pulmonic stenosis is relieved by resecting the muscle bundles in the right ventricular outflow tract and sometimes by slicing through the stenotic pulmonic valve. Because the valve is often damaged during the repair, the most common long-term complication is pulmonic regurgitation and right ventricular enlargement. All patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot require lifelong follow-up, and the majority require pulmonic valve replacement before middle-age. Arrhythmias are also common complications. 10  10-Answers \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 7: Valvular Heart Disease Day: 11 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 78 year-old patient presents with an episode of syncope. You ask about physical activity, and they respond that they do not much. You ask why and the patient says they used to be physically active, walking regularly, but about six months ago, felt short of breath on regular walks, and later developed chest tightness with the shortness of breath. The patient reasoned they were just getting older and cut back on their activity. On physical examination, blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate is regular at 80 bpm, and there is a harsh, grade 3/6 systolic murmur heard best at the right 3rd intercostal space that radiates to the neck. Question 1 What is the most likely diagnosis and etiology? How would your answer to the etiology change if the patient was 56 years old? Aortic valve stenosis. The patient most likely has calcific degeneration of a trileaflet aortic valve - a process very similar to atherosclerosis with most of the same risk factors. If the patient was 56 years-old, they would most likely have degeneration of a bicuspid aortic valve. Note that a bicuspid valve can be associated with dilation of the ascending aorta and coarctation of the aorta. Question 2 What physical exam finding(s) would suggest a severe degree of valve stenosis? Do you expect the left ventricle to be dilated? Hypertrophied? What test do you recommend? Physical exam findings that can occur with severe aortic valve stenosis include abnormally weak and slow carotid pulses (\"parvus et tardus\") and a diminished aortic valve closure sound (A2). The left ventricle is not dilated until very late in the disease course unless there is also significant aortic regurgitation. Pressure overload of the left ventricle results in concentric hypertrophy. Finally, the test of choice is an echocardiogram to directly evaluate the valve.  7-Answers 1 \\nYour test of choice reports a peak aortic jet velocity of 4.5 m/s, a mean systolic gradient of 50 mm Hg across the valve, and a valve area of 0.8 cm2. No aortic regurgitation is detected. Question 3 Do the test findings suggest mild, moderate, or severe valve stenosis? The echocardiogram indicates this is severe. Severe valvular aortic stenosis is characterized by a peak aortic flow velocity >4 m/sec, a mean systolic gradient >40 mm Hg, and valve area <1.0 cm2. Moderate stenosis is associated with a peak velocity of 3-4 m/sec, and mild stenosis a peak velocity <3 m/sec. Question 4 Below is a diagram of the normal left atrial, left ventricular, and aortic pressure curves. Draw the changes you would expect with this valvular pathology. Add the heart sounds you would expect. The figure on the left is a normal pressure tracing, the figure on the right is with aortic stenosis. 2  7-Answers \\nQuestion 5 2 What is the pathophysiological explanation for the patient\\'s symptoms? In the absence of coronary artery narrowing, angina occurs because of a high degree of myocardial oxygen consumption related to very high left ventricular wall stress. We can quantify this wall stress as follows. From the echocardiogram, the patient\\'s peak aortic jet velocity (Vpeak) is 4.5 m/s. Assuming their exercise aortic approximately 4Vpeak pressure remains at 140 mm Hg, then their peak left ventricular (LV) systolic pressure will be approximately 140 + 81 = 221 mm Hg. This elevated pressure causes a similarly high wall stress, and thus, elevated myocardial oxygen consumption. Syncope occurs because blood pressure falls with exercise and the heart is unable to increase its cardiac output to compensate. SVR normally drops during exercise as large skeletal muscles increase their metabolic activity, subsequently vasodilating their arterial beds. This results in a fall in blood pressure. In patients with severe AS, stroke volume cannot increase as it normally would because of the increased valve resistance. Thus, cardiac output does not increase to compensate for the decreased blood pressure. Question 6 Describe the natural history of asymptomatic and symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. What treatment do you recommend? Patients do well until symptoms develop. When symptoms occur, mortality increases. Aortic valve replacement is the treatment of choice for symptomatic aortic valve stenosis. Time to 50% mortality 5 years 3 years 2 years Symptom Angina Syncope Heart failure  7-Answers 3 \\nCase 2 A 32 year-old patient with a long history of a cardiac murmur returns for routine follow-up. The patient reports no symptoms and says they are physically active. On examination, blood pressure is 140/60 mm Hg, and there is a grade 2/6, diastolic decrescendo murmur heard best at the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Question 1 What is the most likely diagnosis? What physical findings should you look for to determine if the valve dysfunction is severe? The diastolic murmur suggests regurgitation of the pulmonic or aortic valves. Aortic valve regurgitation is much more common, and the wide pulse pressure suggests this diagnosis. Severe aortic regurgitation (AR) can be associated with a \"water hammer pulse,\" which is a bounding, forceful pulse with a rapid upstroke and descent due to the wide pulse pressure. There is also left ventricular (LV) dilatation and associated eccentric hypertrophy with severe AR, which can manifest as a laterally displaced apical impulse. Question 2 What is the most likely etiology? What other possible etiologies should be considered? A congenitally abnormal (bicuspid) aortic valve is the most likely etiology in this young person with a long-standing murmur. Marfan\\'s syndrome should also be considered as it is associated with dilatation of the ascending aorta and secondary aortic valve regurgitation. Less likely etiologies include rheumatic disease, prior endocarditis, or traumatic injury of the valve. 4  7-Answers \\nYou order an echocardiogram and it shows a broad color Doppler jet of aortic valve regurgitation, reversal of flow in the abdominal aorta during diastole, and a markedly dilated left ventricle with a decreased ejection fraction of 45%. Question 3 Why is the ventricle dilated? What is the significance of the decreased ejection fraction? What is the significance of the reversal of flow in the abdominal aorta? The volume overload of the left ventricle (LV) resulting from aortic regurgitation leads to LV dilatation. Note from the Law of LaPlace, that LV wall stress increases with increasing radius (𝜎 = Pr 2h/ ). Thus, in addition to dilation, there is LV hypertrophy as a result of increased wall stress. This is termed eccentric hypertrophy. This increase in preload leads to an increase in stroke volume (by the Frank-Starling law). Thus, the EF should be normal if the LV remains healthy. However, long-standing severe AR and chronically elevated wall stress can lead to a loss of LV contractility, and thus a fall in EF.This is an ominous sign, and LV function may not fully recover even with valve replacement. Reversal of flow in the abdominal aorta during diastole is a sign of severe aortic regurgitation. Question 4 Why does angina occur in some patients with severe aortic valve regurgitation? Myocardial oxygen consumption is elevated because of increased LV wall stress associated with dilatation. Myocardial oxygen delivery, especially to the subendocardium, is compromised because of low diastolic blood pressure and high LV end-diastolic pressure. (Refer to Chapter 13 on Coronary Blood Flow.) Question 5 What treatment do you recommend? Aortic valve replacement is indicated because of the drop in EF in association with severe AR. 7-Answers 5 \\nCase 3 A 28 year-old patient with a history of rheumatic fever as a child presents at 16 weeks of pregnancy with increasing dyspnea. They describe dyspnea when walking one block or more, and difficulty breathing when lying flat in bed. Examination shows a blood pressure of 120/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 86 bpm and regular, and a rumbling, grade 2/6 diastolic murmur best heard at the cardiac apex. Jugular venous pressure is elevated at 10 cm, lungs have bibasilar rales, and extremities are warm with normal pulses. An ECG shows left atrial enlargement. Question 1 What is the most likely explanation for these findings? What is the most likely etiology? The murmur is very characteristic of mitral stenosis. Note that aortic regurgitation can also have a rumbling quality at the apex. The absence of a murmur along the left sternal border makes aortic regurgitation unlikely. Given the history of rheumatic fever, the etiology is almost certainly rheumatic mitral valve disease. Question 2 Below is a diagram of the normal left ventricular and atrial pressure curves. Draw the changes you would expect with this valvular pathology. Add the heart sounds you would expect. 6  7-Answers \\nQuestion 3 Why did they develop symptoms during pregnancy? What other conditions that could provoke these symptoms? Pregnancy causes an increase in blood volume and heart rate. This leads to an increase in velocity across the mitral valve, and thus an exponentially increased pressure gradient across 2). Thus, any condition that leads to increased velocity across the mitral the valve (recall P ~ 4V2 valve could exacerbate the pressure gradient and subsequently symptoms. Examples of such conditions include fever and anemia. Question 4 What changes do you expect to see in the left atrium and pulmonary venous pressure? What complications may occur with these changes? The left atrium experiences pressure overload as a result of mitral stenosis. This leads to left atrial enlargement, which can lead to atrial fibrillation. Rapid atrial fibrillation is often not well tolerated due to the loss of full atrial contraction and thus, non-optimal LV filling. Atrial fibrillation is also a risk factor for thromboembolism and stroke, especially in patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease. Once atrial fibrillation occurs, anticoagulation therapy can reduce the risk of thromboembolism and stroke. Elevated left atrial pressure can also result in elevated pulmonary venous pressures. If longstanding, this leads to vascular changes in the pulmonary arterial circulation and subsequent pulmonary hypertension. If pulmonary hypertension becomes severe, the right ventricle will subsequently hypertrophy, dilate, and then fail. Question 5 What changes to you expect to see in the left ventricle? None - with mitral stenosis, the LV experiences neither volume nor pressure overload. Question 6 What type of treatment is there for the condition itself? Balloon mitral valvuloplasty, surgical mitral commissurotomy, mitral valve repair (rarely done in the US), and mitral valve replacement.  7-Answers 7 \\nCase 4 A 62 year-old patient with a long history of an asymptomatic murmur presents with a one-week history of dyspnea at rest and episodes of waking up at night with severe shortness of breath that are relieved after the patient sits up and opens the window. On examination, they are afebrile, blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg, and heart rate 98 bpm. On cardiac exam, there is an irregular rhythm and a 3/6 harsh holosystolic murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. ECG is normal. Question 1 What is the most likely diagnosis, and what are the most likely etiologies? What probably happened a week ago? The patient has a murmur of mitral regurgitation. Possible etiologies include myxomatous disease (\"mitral valve prolapse\"), endocarditis, dilated LV cardiomyopathy, ischemic heart disease with papillary muscle dysfunction secondary to ischemia or infarction, and rheumatic mitral valve disease. The history of a long-standing murmur and absence of fever makes endocarditis much less likely. Rheumatic mitral valve disease is uncommon in the US.The acute deterioration suggests either acute ischemia, infarction, or chordal rupture in the setting of myxomatous mitral valve disease. Given the normal ECG, myxomatous mitral valve disease with chordal rupture is the most likely diagnosis. Question 2 Compare this murmur\\'s duration to a patient with aortic valve stenosis. Which is shorter? An aortic stenosis murmur occurs from aortic valve opening to aortic valve closure. A mitral valve regurgitation murmur occurs from mitral valve closure (prior to aortic valve opening) to mitral valve opening (after aortic valve closure). In other words, aortic valve stenosis spans phase C through D of the cardiac cycle (Reference Chapter 6, Figure 6-6), mitral regurgitation spans phases B through E.Thus, the aortic stenosis murmur is shorter. 8  7-Answers \\nQuestion 3 What effect does this valve lesion have on left ventricular size and function acutely? Chronically? What happens to the left atrial v wave? What happens to pulmonary artery pressure? - Acute severe mitral regurgitation leads to a marked increase in LV end-diastolic volume, so the LV dilates. The overall afterload on the LV is low because a substantial part of stroke volume goes back into the left atrium. Thus, the ventricle generally appears hyperdynamic (ie EF is elevated). - Chronic severe mitral regurgitation can lead to a loss of contractility, further dilatation, and systolic dysfunction. - The left atrial v wave is prominent as the normal increase in LA pressure during systole is exaggerated by the regurgitant volume. - Pulmonary artery pressure increases in response to the increase in LA and pulmonary venous pressure. Question 4 What results can be expected from surgical therapy? If successful, mitral valve repair or replacement would result in no more than mild mitral valve regurgitation. Assuming LV contractility remains intact, symptoms should completely resolve, and LV dimensions will normalize with time.  7-Answers 9 \\n 10  7-Answers \\n CPR - Pulmonary Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 5: Answers to Why Is This Patient Obstructed Cases Day: 22 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 60 year-old woman presents to the International Clinic complaining of dyspnea on exertion. She has trouble walking uphill and doing chores around the house. She can only walk about 10 minutes on flat ground before having to stop to catch her breath. She also has an intermittent cough that is not productive of sputum. She has not been hospitalized due to respiratory issues and has never smoked cigarettes. She formerly lived in a small, remote village in a low-income country but, following an episode of severe political violence, was relocated to a refugee where she spent several years before coming to the United States. You send the patient for a chest radiograph and then perform pulmonary function testing. The results are as follows: CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 1 \\nBronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change % 82 52 N/A 109 152 47 Post- 3.3 1.7 0.52 - - - % 3 6 N/A - - - Case 1 (Continued) Parameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) RV (Liters) DLCO (ml/min/mm Hg) 3.9 3.1 0.79 5.8 1.9 33.4 Pre- 3.2 1.6 0.50 6.3 2.9 15.7 1. What features of the chest radiograph are consistent with emphysema? The chest radiograph findings consistent with emphysema include the large lung volumes with flattened diaphragms and the hyper-lucency (absence of lung markings) in the apical regions, particularly in the right upper lung zone. The mediastinum and heart also appear narrow or \"stretched out\" due to the hyperinflation. 2. How would you interpret the results of the pulmonary function testing? The FVC is normal. The FEV1 is reduced. The FEV1/FVC is decreased. There is no bronchodilator response. This pattern of results is consistent with an obstructive process. The TLC is within normal limits, indicating that she does not have hyperinflation. The RV is increased, and indicates the patient has air-trapping. The DLCO is reduced. 3. What is the most likely explanation for the low diffusing capacity and what does this tell us about the etiology of the clinical diagnosis? The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide gives us information about the surface area available for gas exchange. When the DLCO is reduced in patients with obstructive defects, it suggests that emphysema is one of the primary sources of their airflow obstruction. With emphysema, there is destruction of the alveolar septae leading to enlargement of the airspaces and destruction of the capillary network serving the alveoli. Both processes diminish the surface area available for gas exchange. In asthma, where the pathophysiology is largely focused in the airways and the alveolar spaces are normal, the surface area for gas exchange and, therefore, the DLCO should be normal. 2 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\nCase 1 (continued) Given that she has chronic symptoms and airflow obstruction on her pulmonary function testing, this patient most likely has Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The diagnosis also requires the presence of a risk factor and, on the surface, she appears to lack a clear one, as she is a life-long non-smoker. The fact she emigrated from a low-income country to the United States, however, raises a suspicion that she may have had significant exposure to indoor air pollution while living in her rural village. It would be important to inquire as to whether she spent a lot of time using a wood or animal dung burning stove that was poorly ventilated to the outside of the home as this is now recognized as a major risk factor for COPD worldwide. In fact, due to the higher risk of exposure to indoor air pollution in low- income countries (as well as increased tobacco use among women in high income countries) COPD now affects men and women almost equally. Given the low diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and the findings on chest radiography, it is likely that emphysema is the primary etiology for her COPD.Remember that a patient can have emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis based on the imaging and clinical history, respectively, but you cannot label them as having COPD until you have spirometry showing a low FEV1/FVC ratio. 4. Why does she become more dyspneic with exertion? The severity of a COPD patient\\'s symptoms are not solely a function of the decrement in their FEV1 relative to normal and, instead, are determined by a variety of other factors including the degree of hyperinflation, how much reversibility they have in their airflow obstruction, the degree of hypoxemia, the strength of their respiratory drives and other factors. Several mechanisms likely account for the dyspnea on exertion seen in patients with COPD.With exercise, the respiratory rate increases and exhalation time shortens. With less time to exhale a given tidal volume, the patient is prone to air-trapping, which leads to hyperinflation and flattening of the diaphragms. These changes make it very hard for her to initiate breaths (the diaphragm does not contract efficiently when it assumes a flat shape) and leads to significant dyspnea. A similar phenomenon can occur when COPD patients become tachypneic secondary to increased anxiety or anger. Interestingly, despite the fact that patients have airflow obstruction on exhalation, they actually often report that they have difficulty getting air into their lung on inhalation. This is thought to be due to the air-trapping and flattening of the diaphragms, which makes breath initiation difficult. Another mechanism relates to the increase in CO2 production during exercise. Normal individuals raise their minute and alveolar ventilation to compensate for this change and, as a result, PaCO2 remains constant. A patient with severe COPD, however, may not be able to raise her minute and alveolar ventilation adequately during exercise due to their mechanical limitations. As a result, they cannot eliminate the CO2 being produced and PaCO2 starts to rise, which is often a major source of dyspnea (this is why you become dyspneic when holding your breath when beneath the surface of the water. Your PaCO2 is rising and your central respiratory centers are not happy). CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 3 \\n Case 1 (continued) Finally, as cardiac output increases, perfusion increases throughout the lung. At the same time, ventilation may not increase uniformly throughout the lung. As a result, VA/Q ratios will decrease in many areas, leading to worsening hypoxemia. Depending on the strength of her neural responses to hypoxemia, this may also contribute to the sense of dyspnea. 5. What are the mechanisms of action of the most appropriate medications to start for this patient at this time? How does the observed bronchodilator response on pulmonary function testing affect your decision? The decision about what medications to start for outpatient management of COPD should be based on an assessment of the severity of their disease. One approach is that put forth by the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), which incorporates the severity of the symptoms, as assessed by formal scoring systems (known as the CAT score and mMRC) and the number of exacerbations per year (see the figure below). 4 Although a formal questionnaire is used to gauge symptom severity, her description of having to stop after walking only 10 minutes on flat ground would suggest she has \"high\" symptoms. (You do not need to know the specifics of the symptom scoring systems for the purposes of this class) Because she has never had an exacerbation, she would likely fall in Category B.Once the patient is labeled as being in Category A, B, C or D, we can then choose an appropriate initial medication regimen. Group Initial Treatment Regimen A B C D A short or long-acting anti-muscarinic or b2-agonist Long-acting anti-muscarinic or long acting b2-agonist Long-acting anti-muscarinic Long-acting anti-muscarinic or Long-acting anti-muscarinic plus long acting b2-agonist or long acting b2-agonist plus ICS Being in category B, it would be appropriate to put her on a long-acting anti-muscarinic (e.g., tiotropium) or long-acting b2-adrenergic receptor (eg salmeterol or formoterol) to be used on a regular basis, as well as short-acting agents that are used on an as needed (prn) basis. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\n  Anti-muscarinics: When given via the inhaled form, these agents competitively inhibit airway M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors, blocking bronchoconstriction and mucous production mediated by vagal discharge. b2-adrenergic receptor agonists (often referred to simply as \"beta-agonists\"): When given via the inhaled form, these agents stimulate adenylyl cyclase via a G-protein coupled mechanism leading to an increase in cyclic AMP in airway smooth muscle and, as a result, bronchodilation. Case 1 (continued) Regarding their mechanism of action: Adjustments to this medication regimen can be made based on how she responds to this initial approach. Despite the fact that the patient does not meet criteria for a bronchodilator response (an increase in either the FEV1 or FVC by 200 mL and 12% following administration of a short- acting bronchodilator) she should still receive either of these bronchodilators as the mainstay of her therapeutic regimen, as well as the short-acting agents. It has been amply demonstrated that even when patients do not have a bronchodilator response on pulmonary function testing, they still derive symptomatic benefit from these medications over time.

She has been having repeated attacks of shortness of breath, cough, and chest tightness over a several month period. These have occurred mainly at night but she notes a few episodes that have occurred during the day as well, particularly following exertion or in cold weather. Just yesterday, she developed some dyspnea during her gym class at school, which prompted her mother to bring her in after she finished work. Along with her mother and two younger brothers, she currently lives in an old, carpeted apartment in public housing after several years of moving between rental units every few months. She is a non-smoker but her mother and her mother\\'s boyfriend both smoke. They have no pets. She has applied to college and is currently working several jobs outside of school to supplement the income her mother earns in the food service industry. She is sent home from Urgent Care with an albuterol inhaler and given a referral to a local clinic. On follow-up at the clinic two weeks later, she reports that she has been using the albuterol on a daily basis and is also using it several times per week at night when she wakes up with wheezing. Spirometry is performed before and after administration of a short-acting bronchodilator and shows the following results: Parameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC 5.5 4.6 0.76 Pre- 5.0 3.3 0.66 1. How would you interpret her spirometry? Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change % 91 72 - Post- 5.3 4.0 0.75 % 6 21 N/A This patient has a low FEV1 and a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio. She also has a significant bronchodilator response, as her FEV1 increases by 700 mL and 21% following administration of a short-acting bronchodilator. This would be characterized as \"reversible airflow obstruction,\" one of the hallmarks of asthma. Keep in mind that a spirogram done during an asthma attack would reveal much more severe obstruction, although spirometry is rarely performed during the evaluation of acute severe dyspnea. In addition, if a patient comes into clinic when they are asymptomatic, spirometry may be entirely normal, with no observable response to an inhaled bronchodilator. 2. What factors are contributing to her clinical picture? The clinical history and presence of reversible airflow obstruction on spirometry are consistent with a diagnosis of asthma. The evaluation and management of asthma patients should always include identification and mitigation of factors that trigger worsening symptoms. For this patient, the clinical history suggests that cold and exertion may be triggers of her disease, as they are for many patients. There is no history to suggest a clear allergic component to her disease, although the exposure to cigarette smoke in the home is likely contributing to her problems. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 7 \\nCase 2 (continued) Asthma, like many other chronic conditions, is a manifestation not only of biologic factors, but also environmental and societal issues. As a result, it is necessary to look beyond the issues described above and consider other factors that could be contributing to her disease. For example, she and her family have not had a stable housing situation and she is working several jobs outside of school in order to help with the family\\'s financial situation. This suggests she may have significant psychosocial stressors, which have been shown to contribute to the frequency and severity of asthma attacks. The family\\'s low socioeconomic status may also restrict access to health care, limit their ability to prioritize activities that will be important in her subsequent asthma care, and increase exposure to environmental triggers. Such factors may explain why her first contact with the health care system for this issue was through the Urgent Care at a large, urban hospital when her mother could find time after work. The fact that she lives in an old, carpeted apartment may predispose her to known asthma triggers such as mold and dust mites. Adequate management of her asthma requires consideration of this broader range of issues and not just the biologic factors. An example of a multi-faceted approach to address this broader range of initiatives is the Healthy Homes II program in Seattle King County. Further information about this program can be found below. 3. What are the mechanisms of action of the most appropriate medications to start her on at this time? How does this regimen contrast to the baseline treatment regimen in a patient with COPD due to long-time smoking? The detailed approach to outpatient asthma management is described in Chapter 10. All patients with asthma are prescribed medications to use on an as needed basis (prn). These are called \"rescue\" medications. In the past, these were typically short-acting b2-receptor agonists (SABA, typically albuterol), which work by stimulating adenylyl cyclase via a G- protein coupled mechanism leading to an increase in cyclic AMP in airway smooth muscle and, as a result, bronchodilation. Based on recent data from randomized, controlled trials, however, it is now felt that combination of a low dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and the long-acting b2-receptor agonist formoterol is more effective than a SABA alone at preventing exacerbations. For this reason, the primary reliever/rescue medication is now the low-dose ICS-formoterol combination. The frequency of her symptoms strongly suggests that her disease is not under good control at this time. In particular, she would be labeled as having \"persistent\" rather than \"intermittent\" disease. When patients with asthma are deemed to have persistent disease they warrant initiation of a controller medication. For asthma, the first-line controller therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone). These agents work by binding to glucocorticoid receptors. These complexes then dimerize and bind to genomic glucocorticoid response elements. This leads to decreased synthesis of pro-inflammatory proteins and increased synthesis of lipocortin-1, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. The latter helps decrease production of leukotrienes, which have potent bronchoconstrictor effects. Depending on the degree of control obtained with the initial regimen, the controller regimen can be modified by increasing the intensity of the inhaled corticosteroid therapy and/or CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 8 \\nCase 2 (continued) adding other medications such as long-acting beta agonists or leukotriene receptor antagonists. Importantly, long-acting beta agonists should never be used a monotherapy in patients with asthma due to concern about an increased risk of mortality when they are used in this manner. They should only be started when patients with asthma are already on an inhaled corticosteroid. There are several key differences relative to COPD management. The most important is that because asthma is inherently an inflammatory process, inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay of controller therapy, whereas in COPD, they are only added on in more severe cases. Another difference is that anti antimuscarinic agents (eg ipratropium, tiotropium) are not generally used in outpatient asthma management unlike in COPD where they are a key part of the treatment regimen. They are typically only added when patients continues to have airflow obstruction despite optimal therapy with anti-inflammatory agents and beta-agonists. While medication choices are important for achieving adequate asthma control, it is important to also consider ways to avoid or mitigate precipitating factors. Failure to eliminate triggers such as mold or dust mites can lead to ongoing poor disease control. Multiple studies have also shown that comprehensive initiatives that synchronize interventions on the individual, home, school and community level can positively impact asthma outcomes. Effect of environmental interventions to reduce exposure to asthma triggers in homes of low-income children in Seattle. Appropriate treatment was started in clinic. Her asthma improved significantly and she had no serious episodes for several months, after which time she began using her medications irregularly. During an upper respiratory tract infection, she started wheezing and having increasing difficulty breathing. Despite restarting her medications, she had to go to the Emergency Department where she was found to have audible wheezing, use of accessory muscles and a prolonged expiratory phase. An arterial blood gas was performed in the ED while she was breathing.\\nIs the PaCO2 what you would expect for his clinical situation? Her PaCO2 is low because she is hyperventilating. On the surface, you might not expect this due to the airflow obstruction and increased work of breathing, but during acute asthma exacerbations patients usually hyperventilate due to both mechanical and central nervous system stimuli. In fact, if you see a patient in a severe acute asthma exacerbation and they have a normal or, worse yet, a high PaCO2, you should be very concerned that they are developing respiratory muscle fatigue and are about to go into frank respiratory failure. Their PaCO2 may have been lower earlier in their exacerbation and it is now rising as their respiratory muscles begin to fatigue and they are no longer able to maintain the increased work of breathing. 5. How does her physiologic reserve differ from that of a 14 month-old girl presenting to the Emergency Department with the same problem? There are several reasons why infants and young children are at increased risk for respiratory failure during acute exacerbations of asthma compared to older individuals. You will recall that airway resistance is inversely proportional to the radius of the airway raised to the 4th power: R!\"~\\t1r# Infants and young children have smaller airways than adults. As a result, a similar amount of circumferential edema (e.g., 1 mm) narrows the airway much more than in an adult and, as a result, causes a greater increase in airway resistance and work of breathing. Infants and young children are less able to sustain this increased work of breathing because their respiratory muscles have less mass and fewer fatigue resistant fibers than in adults. Also, because the ribs are more horizontal and the diaphragms flatter, infants and young children get less chest expansion and, therefore, smaller volumes on inhalation, which mandates that they breathe at a faster rate. Infants and young children are also be at risk for greater degrees of hypoxemia because of their higher metabolism and increased oxygen demand relative to that of adolescents and adults. Because the efflux of oxygen from the alveolar space is increased, any process that decreases ventilation and the influx of oxygen will cause a rapid decrease in the PAO2 and, as a result, markedly increase the risk of hypoxemia. 10 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\nCase 3 A 42 year-old man with a long smoking history presents to the emergency department complaining of worsening dyspnea and productive cough that developed several days after an upper respiratory tract infection. Before you go and evaluate him, you review his chart in the electronic medical record and note that he underwent diagnostic testing several years ago through his primary care provider after he presented with worsening dyspnea on exertion. The pulmonary function testing, chest radiograph and air arterial blood gas (done while breathing air) performed at that time were as follows: Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change Pre- 2.3 0.7 0.30 5.9 4.5 3.6 % 72 29 - 110 136 150 Post- 2.4 0.7 0.29 - - - % 4 0 N/A - - - Parameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC TLC (Liters) FRC (Liters) RV (Liters) 3.2 2.4 0.70 5.4 3.3 2.4 pH 7.37 PaCO2 (mm Hg) 48 PaO2 (mm Hg) 56 HCO3- (mmol/L) 31 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 11 \\nCase 3 (continued) His provider started him on inhaled tiotropium and formoterol on a scheduled basis as well as inhaled albuterol to be used as needed. His dyspnea prevented him from continuing his work in construction leading him to be given a permanent disability for which he has been receiving benefits through Social Security for over 2 years. 1. Why was the FRC high? FRC, the volume of air left in the lungs at the end of tidal exhalation, is determined by the balance between the tendency of the lung to recoil to a lower volume and the tendency of the chest wall to recoil out to a larger volume. Because of the likely emphysematous changes in his lungs, the elastic recoil of the lung is diminished. As a result, in the ongoing battle between the lungs and chest wall, the chest wall gains the advantage and the system is pulled up to a higher volume at the end of exhalation. 2. Why was his PaCO2 elevated? This patient has an elevated PaCO2. Despite this, the pH remains in the normal range, suggesting that this is a chronic abnormality. Chronic hypercarbia, also referred to as \"CO2 retention\" can develop in patients with very bad COPD.As was discussed in Chapter 3, the PaCO2 is determined by the balance between CO2 production on the one hand, and alveolar ventilation on the other. Therefore, whenever you see a patient with hypercarbia, you must consider why these factors are not in balance. You can assume the patient likely has normal CO2 production (he\\'s at rest, does not have fevers, infection or a hypermetabolic state). As a result, the PaCO2 is up because he cannot maintain adequate alveolar ventilation. This is likely due to the fact that he has a lot of dead-space (ie ventilation without perfusion) as a consequence of his COPD.More specifically, the high dead space is due to enlargement of the airspaces, which limits contact with the capillary bed (air in the center of large air spaces is no longer in close contact with the alveolar capillaries as it would be in a normal, small alveolus) and due to destruction of the capillaries by the emphysematous changes. 12 Note that the blue-shaded areas in the middle of the air spaces in the figure is not an area of alveolar filling, as in pneumonia. Instead, they simply denote the region in the middle of the alveolar space that is too far from the capillaries in the walls of the alveolar units. Impaired respiratory mechanics make it difficult to maintain an adequately high minute ventilation to deal with this high dead space requirement. After devoting a significant amount CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\nCase 3 (continued) of his minute ventilation to clearing this high dead-space, he likely does not have enough ventilation \"left over\" to satisfy his alveolar ventilation requirements. Patients with COPD typically show alveolar hypoventilation and thus CO2 retention only when the FEV1 is < 0.8 - 1 L (or about 25-30% predicted), although there are exceptions to this rule in which CO2 retention is seen at higher FEV1 values. 3. What features of his presentation are atypical for COPD secondary to long-standing tobacco use? What other diagnosis should you consider? There are two features of his presentation that are atypical for COPD related to long-standing tobacco use. First, he is somewhat on the young side for that diagnosis, as smoking-related COPD typically presents in the 50-60 years of age range or later. Second, smoking-related emphysema causes centrilobular emphysema that predominantly affects the upper lung zones. On his film, however, the hyperlucency is predominantly in the lung bases. This is a pattern more commonly seen in pan-lobular emphysema. Given the young age of presentation and the radiographic findings, you would need to consider a diagnosis of alpha-one antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. Individuals with alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency who smoke develop emphysema and COPD at a very young age, while those who refrain from smoking may not develop it until much later in their life. Diagnostic testing includes measuring serum alpha-one antitrypsin levels and genetic testing. Management of airflow obstruction is largely the same as for COPD except certain AAT patients also receive replacement therapy with intravenous alpha-one antiprotease. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 13 \\nCase 3 (continued) In the emergency department, an arterial blood gas was obtained while breathing air and showed the following results: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 Oxygen was started at a low flow rate (4 L/min by nasal prongs) and the ABG was repeated: PaCO2 (mm Hg) PaO2 (mm Hg) HCO3 pH 7.35 pH 7.31 64 72 4. What does the change in PaO2 with supplemental oxygen administration tell you about the likely cause of his hypoxemia? The observed change in his PaO2 with supplemental oxygen suggests that, in addition to hypoventilation, low VA/Q rather than shunt is the primary cause of his hypoxemia. One of the hallmarks of shunt is that the PaO2 does not rise significantly with supplemental oxygen administration (how much it rises depends on the shunt fraction and the FIO2). In his case, his PaO2 rose 48 mm Hg when he was given oxygen at a low flow rate of 4 L/min by nasal cannula (a small amount). This response is more typical of patients with predominantly hypoventilation and low VA/Q.Clinically, we see this a lot in the hospital. Patients present with COPD exacerbations and have a very low SpO2 or PaO2. With application of supplemental oxygen at low flow rates, their oxygenation improves markedly. This is in contrast to a patient with pneumonia who has a lot of shunt physiology because the alveoli are filled with pus. In these patients, application of a similar amount of supplemental oxygen as used in a COPD exacerbation patient will likely not result in a significant improvement in the SpO2 or PaO2. 42 90 - (mmol/L) 35 - (mmol/L) 36 14 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\nParameter Predicted FVC (Liters) FEV1 (Liters) FEV1/FVC 4.35 3.69 0.85 Pre- 4.20 2.56 0.61 % 96 69 - Post- 4.29 2.65 0.55 % 2.0 3.5 N/A Case 4 A 29 year-old man presents to clinic for evaluation of episodic dyspnea and wheezing over a several week period. He denies cough but notes that his dyspnea is worse at night, particularly when lying in the supine position. Spirometry is performed in clinic and reveals the following: Bronchodilator Predicted Bronchodilator Change 1. How would you interpret his pulmonary function tests? The pulmonary function tests demonstrate airflow obstruction without a bronchodilator response. The patient is started on therapy for the observed abnormality on pulmonary function testing and sent home. Two weeks later, he presents to the emergency department stating that his dyspnea is getting worse despite adhering to the treatment regimen started by his primary care provider. In addition to obtaining a chest radiograph, you review the spirometry results from his prior clinic visit and note the flow-volume loop obtained during that testing session. Each is shown below. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 15 \\nCase 4 (Continued) 2. Based on the results of the chest radiograph and the review of the flow volume loop, what conclusions can you draw about the cause of his dyspnea? This case demonstrates the importance of not just looking at the numbers when interpreting pulmonary function tests but also reviewing the flow-volume loop, as the loop sometimes points to an alternative diagnosis than that suggested by the numbers alone. At first glance, when a young person presents with dyspnea and is found to have airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing, it is tempting to diagnose them with asthma. In this case, however, the findings on chest radiography and review of the flow-volume loop suggest the patient may have an alternative diagnosis. The chest radiograph shows a widened mediastinum and the narrowing of the trachea within the chest cavity (the tracheal anomaly, highlighted by the white arrows, is a subtle finding that demonstrates the importance of being systematic when you interpret a chest radiograph). The main finding on the flow-volume loop is that the expiratory and inspiratory portions of the loop are \"flattened\" or cut-off. This is the pattern seen when patients have a lesion obstructing the upper airway in which the degree of obstruction does not vary at all with pressure changes in the respiratory cycle. This is known as a \"fixed upper airway obstruction.\" In this case, the patient had lymphoma and a large amount of mediastinal lymphadenopathy encasing and compressing his trachea. Two other patterns of upper airway obstruction can be seen on analysis of the flow-volume loops: Variable extrathoracic obstruction: In this situation, a lesion obstructs the upper airway outside of the chest cavity but the degree of obstruction varies with pressure changes during inhalation and exhalation. An example would be a mobile thyroid mass compressing the trachea in the neck. Variable intrathoracic obstruction: In this situation, a lesion obstructs the upper airway inside of the chest cavity but the degree of obstruction varies with pressure changes during inhalation and exhalation. An example would be tracheomalacia, in which there is destruction of the cartilaginous rings surrounding the anterior two-thirds of the trachea. The flow volume loops for these two other forms of obstruction are shown in the figure below. 16 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\nCase 4 (Continued) A more detailed explanation for why these patterns are seen is provided in an appendix to this answer key. You should be able to recognize the three patterns of upper airway obstruction on flow-volume loops but will not be responsible for explaining the pressure dynamics underlying these patterns on the examinations in this course. 4. In the emergency department, the respiratory therapist asks if you would like to administer the patient a gas mixture with 79% helium and 20.9% oxygen (referred to as heliox) to help relieve his dyspnea. What is the physiologic rationale behind this suggestion? Flow of gas through any rigid tube can have one of two flow patterns, laminar (i.e., smooth) flow or turbulent (i.e., more disorganized) flow (See figure below). In the airways, laminar flow requires less driving pressure and, therefore, less work of breathing than turbulent flow. Whether laminar or turbulent flow prevails at any point in the airway is determined by the geometry of the airway lumen and the density, velocity and viscosity of the gas. Gas velocity is already high in the upper airway, which increases the tendency toward turbulent flow in that region. A focal constriction in this area alters the geometry of the airway and significantly increases the amount of turbulent flow. This leads to increased work of breathing and impairs ventilation, particularly when the constriction is very tight. Because helium has a smaller molecular weight than nitrogen, an 80/20 mixture of helium and oxygen has a much lower density than ambient air, which you recall contains 79% nitrogen and 20.9% oxygen. Breathing this lower density gas decreases the Reynolds number and increases the tendency toward laminar flow, thereby decreasing the work of breathing. In general, the helium/oxygen mixture has benefit in disorders associated with focal airway constriction, such as an obstructing upper airway mass or laryngeal edema, but its utility in significantly less in disorders like COPD or asthma, where airflow obstruction is based largely on pathology in the smaller, more distal airways, where gas velocity is lower and, therefore, laminar flow prevails even in disease states. CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 17 \\nAppendix to Conference 5 Answers This is optional material to help you further understand the physiology behind variable intrA-and extra-thoracic upper airway obstructions. While you will be responsible for being able to recognize the three patterns of upper airway obstruction on a flow-volume loop, you will not be expected to explain the pressure dynamics described below. Physiology of Variable Intrathoracic Obstruction In a variable intrathoracic obstruction\" pattern, the expiratory portion of the curve is flattened while the inspiratory portion has the normal rounded shape (see the figure above). This tells us that whatever is causing obstruction to airflow is having an effect during exhalation but not inhalation. Flattening of only the expiratory limb occurs when there is an obstructing upper airway lesion within the chest cavity in which the diameter of the airway changes over the course of the respiratory cycle (hence the term \"variable\"). An example of this problem would be tracheomalacia due to destruction of the cartilaginous rings that support the trachea. The physiologic basis for these changes are depicted in the figure below: This pattern can be seen with mobile intrathoracic masses as well as with tracheomalacia, a process involving destruction of the airway cartilage that leads to airway collapse on exhalation. Physiology of Variable Extrathoracic Obstruction In a variable extrathoracic obstruction pattern, which occurs when the obstructing lesion is located in the upper airway outside the chest cavity, the expiratory portion of the flow-volume loop is normal while the inspiratory portion is flattened. The airway remains open and flow remains normal on exhalation because airway pressure is positive and higher than the pressure outside the extrathoracic trachea (i.e., transmural pressure is positive). On inhalation, however, airway pressure becomes negative and lower than the pressure outside the extrathoracic trachea. In the presence of a constricting mass, transmural pressure is negative, causing the airway to collapse. This pattern, which can be seen with mobile thyroid masses, for example, is illustrated in the figure below. 18 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\n CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers 19 \\n 20 CPR-Pulmonary-Conference 5 Answers \\n CPR - Cardiovascular Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 9: Ischemic Heart Disease Day: 13 Hours: 3 and 4 Case 1 A 56 year-old patient presents with anterior chest tightness when walking uphill, walking after a large meal, or climbing more than one flight of stairs. There is associated pain in the left upper arm and shortness of breath. The symptoms are relieved after a few minutes of rest. Question 1 What is the clinical diagnosis, and what are potential causes of these symptoms? The clinical diagnosis is angina. The differential diagnosis for angina includes coronary atherosclerosis with 60% or greater narrowing, severe aortic valve stenosis, severe aortic valve regurgitation, acute decompensated heart failure, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with dynamic outflow obstruction. Past medical history includes type II diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. The patient is on no medications and has never smoked. On physical exam: Vital signs: General: Cardiovascular: Pulmonary: Abdominal: Extremities: Afebrile, BP 155/95 mm Hg, HR 80 bpm, RR 12 per minute. Well-developed with central obesity. Appears comfortable. Normal JVP and carotid pulses. No murmurs, gallops, nor LV lift. PMI is not displaced. Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Soft, nontender, no hepatosplenomegaly, no bruits. Warm, 2+ radial and pedal pulses, no edema. A resting ECG is normal. Prior labs include an elevated fasting glucose of 150 mg/dL (high), total cholesterol 225 mg/dL (high), and HDL cholesterol 32 mg/dL (low).  9-Answers 1 \\nQuestion 2 Based on these findings, what is the most likely etiology of this patient\\'s angina? Describe three factors that can cause a reduction of coronary blood flow and subendocardial ischemia during exertion in a patient with coronary narrowing. For the etiology, the exam rules out aortic valve disease, decompensated heart failure, and HCM with dynamic outflow obstruction. Given the history, exam, and risk factors, the most likely cause is coronary artery disease. Exertion and the corresponding increases in heart rate and myocardial contractility result in increased myocardial oxygen consumption. This increase in metabolic demand induces metabolic autoregulation which results in arteriolar vasodilatation, thereby increasing coronary blood flow. Thus: 2. The second factor is 1. The first factor that leads to subendocardial ischemia is the pressure drop across the culprit coronary artery stenosis. Pressure lost as blood flows through a stenosis results in a low pressure distal to the stenosis. This distal pressure is the perfusion pressure for the downstream myocardium. Low perfusion pressure results in low flow. in the coronary microcirculation as perfusion pressure distal to the stenosis falls. Recall from Chapter 1 that when the perfusion pressure is at the low end of the autoregulatory range, the distal arterioles are maximally vasodilated and coronary blood flow cannot increase. If myocardial oxygen consumption increases further, subendocardial ischemia occurs. the exhaustion of vasodilator reserve 3. The third factor is tachycardia during exercise, which increases myocardial oxygen consumption as well as abbreviates diastole and subsequently the duration of coronary blood flow. Question 3 What is this patient\\'s Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class? Why are they at risk for ischemic heart disease? They are approximately Class II.Their risk is due to multiple coronary heart disease risk factors including hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia Question 4 How would you confirm your diagnosis? How would your choice of test change if their ECG showed baseline ST-segment changes, left ventricular hypertrophy, or left bundle branch block, or the patient was taking digoxin? Exercise stress testing is indicated to assess exercise capacity, hemodynamic response, symptoms, and ST-segment depression. If the ECG is abnormal because of LBBB, LV hypertrophy or baseline ST-segment changes, or the patient is taking digoxin, then the stress test should also include an imaging modality since ST-segment changes are already present or 2  9-Answers \\nwill be nonspecific in response to exercise. Options include stress echocardiography or radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. Question 5 What medical therapy would you prescribe at this initial visit? Aspirin is the anti-platelet agent of choice. Anti-anginal therapy should start with a beta-blocker (carvedilol or metoprolol). A calcium channel blocker could be used instead of a beta-blocker for patients who have asthma or another reactive airway disease. Additionally, nitroglycerin could be taken sublingually as needed, or long-acting nitrates could be dosed orally once daily. A statin should be started assuming the diagnosis is coronary heart disease. An exercise stress test is abnormal with the development of limiting angina and 3 mm of horizontal ST-segment depression in lead V3 after 5 minutes of exercise using the Bruce protocol. Question 6 What is the patient\\'s Duke Score? Are they at low, intermediate, or high risk of coronary events? Based on the results, what do you recommend? Duke Score = (Number of minutes) - (5 x ST depression in mm) - (4 x angina index) where the angina index is 0 for none, 1 for non-limiting angina, and 2 for limiting angina. For this patient, Duke Score = 5 - (5 x 3) - (4 x 2) = -18. This score indicates that the patient is at high risk. Based on the treatment algorithm in Syllabus Figure 13-17, they should undergo coronary angiography.  9-Answers 3 \\nCoronary angiography is performed by the cardiologist. Findings are remarkable for a 70- 80% diameter stenosis of a dominant left circumflex coronary artery. The left main, left anterior descending, and non-dominant right coronary arteries demonstrate only mild luminal narrowing. A drug-eluting stent is placed with a 0% residual stenosis. Question 7 How common is a dominant left circumflex coronary artery? What is a drug-eluting stent (DES)? Which anti-platelet medications will you prescribe after stent placement and for how long? Only 10% of patients will have a left dominant system, meaning that the posterior descending artery and branch to the AV node emerge from the left circumflex artery. A DES releases a cell cycle inhibitor (such as everolimus) to decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation and restenosis. The patient should remain on dual anti-platelet therapy (which is aspirin and clopidogrel) for at least 12 months since the cell cycle inhibitor can delay endothelialization of the stent, leading to higher risk of in-stent thrombosis. Question 8 What medical interventions or lifestyle changes would you recommend to reduce the risk of future coronary events, including myocardial infarction? Blood pressure should be controlled, ideally with an ACE inhibitor since this drug class is associated with reduced coronary events. A high intensity statin based on the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) Cholesterol Guidelines. A Mediterranean diet rich in fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and monounsaturated plant oils. 30-60 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week. 4  9-Answers \\nCase 2 A 38 year-old patient presents with acute substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and dyspnea. Symptoms began shortly after lifting heavy boxes at home. The pain has been ongoing for the past 45 minutes. On exam, the patient is pale and diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 90/60 mm Hg, a heart rate of 105 bpm, and cool extremities. JVP is normal, there is no murmur nor gallop, there are scattered rales at the lung bases, and the abdomen is soft and nontender. The initial ECG is below. Question 1 What is the clinical diagnosis? This is an anteroseptal STEMI.Note the reciprocal ST-segment depression in the inferior leads.  9-Answers 5 \\nInitial treatment is with aspirin, IV morphine, and sublingual NTG.A repeat ECG shows no change. Question 2 Describe the pathophysiology of this acute coronary syndrome. Which coronary artery is involved? What are the therapeutic options for this patient and which do you recommend? Should a beta-blocker be administered? The pathophysiology is likely plaque rupture and thrombotic occlusion of a major coronary artery; the left anterior descending artery in this case. The patient should be treated with reperfusion therapy, either emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if available within 120 minutes, or fibrinolytic therapy. PCI is preferred over fibrinolytic therapy based on better overall results and much lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Because there are signs of heart failure and low cardiac output, a beta-blocker should not be given at this time as it could result in cardiogenic shock. Question 3 In addition to aspirin, which anticoagulant agent and anti-platelet agent do you recommend? What are the potential complications of IV heparin? For anticoagulant agents, the patient should receive IV heparin. - - If they undergo emergent PCI, they should receive IV heparin or (less commonly) IV bivalirudin If they undergo fibrinolytic therapy, they should only receive IV heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin. For anti-platelet agents, the patient should receive aspirin and clopidogrel, which you can use with either PCI or fibrinolytic therapy. All antithrombotic and antiplatelet agents are associated with a risk of bleeding. Heparin is also rarely (occurs in <5% of patients) associated with thrombocytopenia, termed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT results from an autoantibody directed against an endogenous platelet factor and heparin complex. After receiving emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, the chest pain resolves, and ST-segment elevation dramatically improves after 30 minutes. Question 4 Why did the patient improve? The occluded coronary artery was reperfused! 6  9-Answers \\nThe patient\\'s troponin I level at the time of presentation was normal. Question 5 Why was this cardiac biomarker normal? What is the timing of troponin elevation in myocardial injury? Troponin I was not yet elevated as the presented very early. Troponin will be elevated by 2-3 hours and remain elevated for up to 5 days. The patient remains hemodynamically stable on hospital day 2 without clinical signs of heart failure. Blood pressure is 80 bpm. An echocardiogram shows severe hypokinesis of the interventricular septum, anterior wall, and left ventricular apex. Ejection fraction is measured at 45%. Question 6 is 120/80 mm Hg and heart rate In addition to anti-platelet therapy, what medical therapy would you prescribe at this time? Pick one agent for each category you choose. A beta-blocker (ie metoprolol, carvedilol) should be started since the patient is no longer in heart failure. All patients with MI should be treated with a beta-blocker for at least 3 years. An ACE inhibitor (ie lisinopril) is indicated for the reduced EF.  All patients with coronary heart disease should receive a high dose statin (ie atorvastatin, rosuvastatin). On hospital day 5, the patient develops acute dyspnea. On physical exam, they appear clammy, blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 110 bpm, and the lung exam reveals diffuse rales. A new, harsh, systolic murmur is auscultated. Question 7 What happened? Why did this complication occur on day 5 and not day 1? How would you distinguish between the two possible causes of this clinical scenario? The new systolic murmur is most likely caused by a new VSD or mitral regurgitation. This can occur with rupture of the ventricular septum or of a papillary muscle due to weakened myocardium. The event occurred now because the infarcted tissue is weakest at 5-7 days. An echocardiogram will tell you whether the patient has a VSD or severe mitral regurgitation. Both complications require emergent surgical intervention.  9-Answers 7 \\nCase 3 A 72 year-old patient presents with acute back pain that began after an argument. The pain is an aching sensation between the shoulder blades and is accompanied by nausea and mild dyspnea. The patient had similar back pain yesterday while walking to the store, which resolved with rest. On exam, they appear uncomfortable, blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg in both arms, heart rate is 78 bpm, lung exam is clear to auscultation, cardiac exam has no rubs nor gallops, abdomen is benign, and pulses are normal in the lower extremities. The patient\\'s ECG is below. Question 1 What is your clinical diagnosis? What is the most likely underlying pathophysiology? Non-ST elevation (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA) are the most likely diagnoses based on the symptoms and ST-segment depression in lead I and the precordial leads (V2-V6). The pathophysiology is similar to a STEMI as it involves plaque rupture or endothelial erosion with thrombus formation, and/or intra-plaque hemorrhage. However, the culprit coronary artery is much less likely to be completely occluded in an NSTEMI.Note that if the troponin level rises, the diagnosis would narrow to NSTEMI.8  9-Answers \\nThe pain resolves after the patient receives aspirin, IV morphine, and sublingual nitroglycerin x 3. The ECG changes resolve. Initial troponin I levels are normal. Question 2 What is your treatment plan? Patient should receive (Syllabus Table 14-4): Anti-anginal therapy: This includes a beta-blocker and topical or IV nitrates. Anti-platelet agents should include aspirin plus either clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Anticoagulant: IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin. Serial troponin I levels should be obtained to assess for infarction. 6 hours after admission, the ECG shows lateral T wave inversion and Troponin I is elevated. The patient remains asymptomatic. Question 3 What are your management options? What do you recommend? Early PCI (angiography and revascularization) is preferred due to high-risk features (Syllabus Table 14-1) of this NSTEMI, including ST-segment depression on presentation and elevated cardiac enzymes. Medical therapy is an alternative if the patient declines PCI. 9-Answers 9 \\n 10  9-Answers \\n CPR - Renal Physiology and Pathophysiology Conference 3: Answers to Sodium and Water Part 1 Problem 1 A.A 30 year-old man of normal build weighs 75 kg Give an estimate of each of the following: 1. Total body water In a 75 kg individual, the total body water (TBW) is approximately 60% of total body weight, or 45 liters 2. Intracellular volume (ICV) The ICV is 2/3 of the total body water, or 30 liters 3. Extracellular volume (ECV) The ECV is 1/3 of total body water or 15 liters 4. Intravascular (plasma) volume The extracellular compartment is further divided into the intravascular compartment (plasma volume) which is approximately 25% of the ECV, or ~3.75 liters 5. Interstitial volume The interstitial compartment, which is 75% of the ECV, or ~11.25 liters Distribution of total body water (TBW) in a 75kg man Intracellular (2/3) 30liters Extracellular (1/3) 15 liters Interstitial Space 11.25 liters (75% of ECF) Plasma Volume 3.75 liters (25% of ECF)  2 Answers 1 \\n Suppose this individual, A 75kg man, opens his mouth and pours in 500 mmol of NaCl (salt), without any water. What would happen to: a. Plasma osmolality? b. ECV? c. ICV? d. plasma Na+ concentration? Sodium is almost entirely confined to the ECV.If we assume that the added NaCl stays in the ECV, the ECV osmolality will increase. This will result in water movement out of the cells, down an osmotic gradient. The osmolality of the ICV will increase as well, even though the added solute stays in the ECV.This brings up an interesting point. As you can see in the above example, the intracellular volume varies inversely with the plasma sodium concentration. As the plasma sodium concentration increases, the size of the ICV decreases. Likewise, low plasma Na+ concentration (hyponatremia) is associated with increased size of the ICV.This is important clinically, because neurological symptoms that occur with acute changes in the plasma Na+ are primarily due to alterations in brain cell volume. Let\\'s take a quantitative look at the example in the small group: (for info, not discussion in small group) For illustration: Prior to adding Na: 60% of his weight is water, TBW = 45kg, 2/3 ICV = 30L, 1/3 ECV = 15L Assuming normal serum Na concentration 140 mEq/L & normal serum osmolality 285 mOsm/kg Total body osmoles = 285 x 45 = 12825 mOsmoles (note that 1 L H2O = 1 kg H2O) ICV osmoles = 285 x 30 = 8550 ECV osmoles = 285 x 15 = 4275 (Note that osmolality equilibrates across all fluid compartments) After adding 500mEq of NaCl (note that for Na and Cl, 1 mEq = 1 mOsm) ICV osmoles = 8550 (same) ECV osmoles = 4275 + 1000 = 5275 (increased by 500 x2 (500 mosm Na + 500 mosm Cl)) New Total body osmoles = 13825 TBW same at 45L Therefore new total osmolality = 13825/45 = 307 mOsm/kg = ICV osmolality = ECV osmolality Volume of fluid in ECV = ECV osmoles / ECV osmolality = 5275 / 307 = 17.2L Volume of ICV = ICV osmoles/ ICV osmolality = 8550/307 = 27.8L Therefore, 2.2L of water will move from ICV (it shrinks) to ECV (it expands) The serum osmolality (& serum Na) increase. (from 285 to 307mOsm/kg) However in real life, at 307mOsm/kg, his thirst would be unbearable and he would head straight to the nearest faucet. As he drinks water, his serum osmolality will fall. This brings the serum osmolality (& serum Na concentration) back toward normal, and we are left with an expanded ECV (assuming this extra volume is not pee\\'d out by the kidneys). 2  2 Answers \\n Case 1 An 18 year-old woman is admitted to the hospital following 4 days of abdominal cramps and severe diarrhea (8-10 watery stools per day). Her skin turgor is poor, the mucous membranes are dry and her blood pressure is 95/60 lying and 70/40 standing. Her weight is 56 kg, compared with her usual weight of 60 kg. Laboratory values are as follows: Na K Cl CO2 BUN Creatinine 128 3.2 100 15 38 1.8 1. Does this patient have a problem with extracellular volume, water, or both? This patient has a problem with both volume and water balance. The patient is clearly volume (ECV) depleted because she has lost both salt and water from diarrhea. She has replaced some of her losses by continued water intake (in excess of Na). In the setting of decreased free water excretion, she has developed hyponatremia. Her weight is down 4 kg (total body water 4L down). However, she is in a state of RELATIVE water excess (compared to Na). A rough estimate here is that her ECV is decreased by 6L and her ICV is increased ~2L for a net change in TBW of 4L.2. What is the most likely cause of her hyponatremia? Volume depletion overrides osmolality as a stimulus for ADH release. Thus, even if a patient is hyponatremic (hypo-osmolar), ADH will still be secreted if that patient is markedly volume contracted. She is therefore excreting a concentrated urine and retaining the water she drinks, diluting the serum Na. 3. What is the appropriate treatment? The patient needs to have her ECV repleted, which will treat her hypovolemia and remove the stimulus for ADH secretion. By giving her isotonic fluid, her salt deficit will be corrected. In addition, this will turn off the stimulation of ADH, thereby allowing her to excrete a dilute urine and return her intracellular volume to normal. Of note, the patient is also hypokalemic (low serum K) and will need K repletion.  2 Answers 3 \\nCase 2 A 75 year-old woman with coronary artery disease is seen in the emergency room with an exacerbation of his heart failure. He complains of SOB.Exam reveals increased respiratory rate, pulse 98, BP 102/64, 3+ peripheral edema with raised JVP.Chest - bibasilar crackles. Meds include lisinopril, simvastatin, aspirin, amlodipine, furosemide, warfarin. Na BUN 128 34 K Cl CO2 3.4 92 24 Creatinine Glucose 1.5 88 1. Does this patient have a problem with extracellular volume, water balance, or or both? She has both a salt (ECV expanded) and water (hyponatremia) problem. She has features of ECV expansion on exam (edema, raised JVP, basal crackles). Note her BP is not elevated, indeed lowish, despite his ECV expansion 2. Explain her hyponatremia using the concept of EABV Her hyponatremia is due to an excess of water relative to Na. In the setting of severe CHF, the cardiac output is diminished, and the baroreceptors sense a low effective arterial blood volume (even though ECV is expanded, the arterial filling is decreased). This decreased EABV leads to activation of the SNS and RAAS (causing Na retention & worsening edema) and ADH (leading to an inability to excrete a dilute urine). The decreased EABV also drives thirst leading to increased water intake, which cannot be readily excreted. Case 3 68 year-old man is found down at home & noted to have right hemiparesis. He has been down for 48hrs and unable to take anything by mouth. On examination, Temp 38.6oC pulse 86, BP 130/80, RR 18, 70Kg Right hemiplegia. Skin hot and dry, good turgor. Tongue dry, not shrunken Heart and lungs clear. No edema 148 110 32 4.2 28 1.3 4 1. Describe this man\\'s volume status. Why is his blood pressure not low? The history sounds as if this man should be dehydrated and, indeed, he is. He has had no access to water for 48hrs. However, it is important to differentiate dehydration from volume depletion. We know he is dehydrated because his serum sodium is elevated (water deficit). We assess his volume status by examination, and in this case his blood  2 Answers \\npressure is maintained (likely from peripheral vasoconstriction). Volume depletion (or ECV depletion) occurs primarily with sodium (+ H2O) loss. Assuming his kidneys have been able to retain sodium effectively, and that he has not lost large amounts of sodium elsewhere (gastrointestinal losses), then we would say he is dehydrated, but only minimally volume depleted. Notes: a) If this patient has lost 3L of H2O but no salt, he will have lost 1/3 of this (1L) from his b) Assessment for a postural drop in his blood pressure may demonstrate more subtle ECV ECV and 2/3 (2L) from his ICV depletion c) In practice it is often hard to make the distinction between pure dehydration and combined volume depletion and dehydration. d) This concept of dehydration versus volume depletion is important to grasp and is fundamental to fluid and electrolyte disorders. 2. What would you expect his urine osmolarity to be? He is hyperosmolar (serum sodium 148) and ADH should be turned on leading to a concentrated urine. (eg urine osmolarity > 600mOsm/kg). Part 2 Case 4 A 60 year old man was hospitalized because of a persistent cough and 25 pound weight loss over 3 months. He had a 40 pack year smoking history. Chest x-ray showed a left pleural effusion. PPD was positive. Physical examination on admission revealed a cachectic man. Temperature 37.6oC, pulse 70, blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, respiration 18 per minute. There was no orthostatic change in blood pressure or pulse. Neck veins were at the level of the sternal angle at 30 degrees. The abdominal exam revealed no masses. Liver span was normal. There was no edema. The patient weighed 65 kg. Laboratory values were: Na K Cl CO2 BUN Creatinine Urine Osm Urine Na 123 3.7 88 24 4 0.6 300 46 1. What other laboratory data would you ask for to determine whether the serum Na+ reflects a low serum osmolality? Glucose. Hyperglycemia is a common cause of high serum osmolality and low serum sodium. Hyperglycemia initially raises the serum osmolality causing water to move out of the cells and into plasma thereby diluting the sodium concentration. For every 60 mg/dl increase in glucose above normal, the serum sodium decreases by 1 mEq/L.(Note in this setting, the ICV is reduced, as H2O has moved from ICV to ECV) A normal osmolality with a low sodium is referred to as pseudohyponatremia. Two main causes of pseudohyponatremia are: hyperlipidemia and hyperproteinemia. In both cases (high triglycerides and high protein levels), the decrease in serum sodium is a laboratory artifact induced by a decrease in the aqueous component of serum.  2 Answers 5 \\n 2. Given the patient\\'s history, physical findings and laboratory data - does he have a problem with ECV (\"salt\"), or water balance? Differentiating between \"salt\" problems and \"water\" problems is important because a given patient can have one or both problems at the same time: SALT problems: Problems with \"salt\" are manifest by changes in the ECV volume. Patients may be \"salt overloaded\" or \"salt depleted\". Recall that the ECV is 25% plasma volume and 75% interstitial volume. Patients who are salt overloaded have an increased size of the ECV.This can be manifest by symptoms of congestive heart failure (+S3, rales, JVD, peripheral edema), or anasarca (total body edema). Pitting edema (expanded interstitial space) is the hallmark of ECV overload (ie salt overload). Salt depleted patients have decreased size of the ECV, and they may show poor skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension, flat neck veins, and dry mucous membranes. WATER problems: Water problems reflect alterations in serum osmolality which represent alterations in intracellular volume. The serum osmolality can be estimated by multiplying the serum sodium x2. Thus, true hyponatremia represents a low serum osmolality, and hypernatremia represents a high serum osmolality. Hyponatremia is not a problem of too little salt; rather, it is a problem of too much water. In our patient, there is no evidence there is a problem with salt balance - there is no evidence of total body salt excess (JVD, rales, S3, edema) or total body salt depletion (poor skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension, dry mucous membranes). The hyponatremia in this patient is a problem of water balance. He has water excess. 3. What are the factors involved in the kidney\\'s ability to excrete free water? In virtually ALL cases of hyponatremia, the kidney is unable to clear free water normally. In order to excrete free water, the kidney must deliver adequate amounts of filtrate to distal sites where solute is separated from water. To achieve this, one must have: a) Adequate GFR: If GFR is markedly reduced, the total amount of filtrate available to be free of NaCl is reduced b) Adequate distal delivery: In certain clinical settings, such as ECV depletion and congestive heart failure, proximal tubular reabsorption is increased, and the absolute amount of filtrate delivered distally is reduced. c) Functional Loop of Henle and cortical diluting sites: These sites must be able to remove NaCl from the filtrate without concomitant movement of water. Clinically, the factors that interfere with this are diuretics. d) The ability to turn OFF ADH release: Any time that ADH is circulating, a dilute urine cannot be made. 4. What are the causes of hyponatremia which need to be considered in this patient? The patient appears to be euvolemic by exam, & ADH is inappropriately high (Uosm should be < 100 otherwise). Recall that the two appropriate stimuli to ADH release are hypovolemia (or decreased EABV) and hyperosmolality. This patient has neither of these stimuli for ADH production; therefore, he likely has inappropriate ADH secretion, also known as SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH). Once again, it is only inappropriate if there is neither a hypovolemic stimulus nor an osmotic stimulus to ADH release.  2 Answers 6 \\nOne clinical note: Before giving the diagnosis of SIADH to a patient, it must be shown that the patient has normal thyroid and adrenal function. These two hormones are essential to produce dilute urine. SIADH is a diagnosis of exclusion. (in other words, we\\'ve ruled everything else out). In order to diagnose SIADH, the patient must have: Euvolemia (no hypovolemia) Urine sodium that is not low (ie there is no hypovolemia) Normal thyroid and adrenal levels Absence of drugs that stimulate ADH release or enhance ADH action The major symptoms of hyponatremia are CNS changes (from swelling of the brain cells). Symptoms may include altered mental status, seizures or coma. 5) How quickly should his hyponatremia be corrected? As this is likely chronic hyponatremia (present for > 48- 72 hours), and the patient is asymptomatic, correction of the hyponatremia must be done slowly to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. It should be corrected no more than 8- 10 meq/ 24 hours. Case 5 A 65 year-old man has CHF secondary to hypertension. He sees his primary care doctor because of increased peripheral edema. On exam, pulse 88 regular, BP 144/88, JVP slightly raised, 2+ edema. Meds: lisinopril, amlodipine, simvastatin, aspirin. He was started on furosemide 40 mg/day but had no weight loss after two weeks. Having heard that Lasix \"lasts six hours\", the physician changes the regimen to 40 mg bid. 1. Reasons for failure to respond to diuretics include: a. High salt diet (can measure 24hr urine Na, should be <2g/24h) b. Nonadherence c. Inadequate dose i. in renal failure, retained organic anions can compete with furosemide for secretion into tubular lumen ii. kidneys may be very Na avid with chronic heart failure (increased Na reabsorption in CCD & activation of RAAS) d. Inadequate frequency. Furosemide is short acting, and may be an anti-diuresis when furosemide not acting e. NSAID (block prostaglandins inhibitory effect on Na reabsorption) 2. Options for managing diuretic resistance include: a. Na restricting, elevating legs, stopping NSAID b. Increasing single dose of furosemide to ensure diuresis (no point in giving an inadequate dose twice!) torsemide) c. May need to give twice daily, or switch to longer acting loop diuretic (eg d. Can give combination loop diuretic with another diuretic that blocks Na reabsorption at a different site in the nephron (eg thiazide, or K sparing).  2 Answers 7 \\n Case 6 A 28 year-old man with a history of central diabetes insipidus is brought to the ER having been found unconscious on Mount Rainier where he had been missing for 24hrs. He has evidence of head trauma. He has no other medical history and his only medication was arginine vasopressin (ADH) by nasal spray 5 units every 6 hours. On admission he is profoundly hypotensive, BP 80/50. His clothes are wet. Serum Na is 170 mEq/L.1. Classify the following as high, low or normal: Extracellular fluid volume, intracellular volume, total body sodium content, total body water content. Without access to his AVP therapy he has untreated diabetes insipidus and will have a large dilute urine output. This is mostly a water diuresis. For every liter of water he excretes, he will excrete only a small amount of sodium. As the number of osmoles in the ECV and ICV will not change much, 2/3 of the water deficit will be from the ICV and 1/3 from the ECV.Therefore: ECV (low), ICV (low), total body sodium content (same, marginally low), TBW (low). 2. Why is he hypernatremic....water loss or Na gain? His hypernatremia is due to water loss, and not sodium gain. We can calculate his water deficit from the equation: Water deficit DH2O = D[Na] x TBW 140 = 170-140/140 x (0.6 x 60kg) = 7.7L Note 2/3 of this will be from the ICV (5.1L) and 1/3 from ECV (2.6L) 3. What would you predict the urine osmolality to be? Without ADH, the kidneys are unable to concentrate the urine and we would expect a very dilute urine (~50mOsm/kg) 4. What is the appropriate therapy? We need to replace his water losses with either oral water or IV water given as 5% dextrose in water. Since he has diabetes insipidus, he will excrete most of the water given to him unless we also resume his AVP.Since his blood pressure is low, it is appropriate to give isotonic fluid initially to expand his ECV quickly. 5. He is treated and recovers consciousness without residual neurological deficit. Two weeks later, he calls his physician saying that he lost his arginine vasopressin (ADH) spray four days ago. He feels fine, but is told to come into the office immediately. On examination he is well with B/P 115/75. Serum sodium is 142 mEq/L Why is the serum sodium normal despite the absence of ADH? This illustrates that in diabetes insipidus, unless patients are unable to access water (eg confined to bed, fallen, infant), hypernatremia will not develop. Rather polydipsia will compensate for the polyuria (assuming an intact thirst response). 8  2 Answers \\n Basic Imaging of the Chest LEARNING OBJECTIVES 1. 2.

The goal is to diagnose disease but in this syllabus, imaging is used to identify normal structures. For additional examples of imaging, please view all of the slides and notes in the slideshow associated with the large group session, \"Basic Imaging of the Chest.\" You may find it helpful to review basic imaging concepts in the \"Introduction to Imaging\" syllabus and slideshow from the MCBD Block. Important Note: In addition to reviewing the syllabus, it is critical to study all of the imaging slide sets, which may serve as source material for exam questions. CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest 1 \\nRADIOGRAPHY There are twelve pairs of ribs (Figure 1). The first rib is the shortest, and it curves under the clavicle. The first rib and the clavicle overlie the lung apex and can obscure pulmonary lesions in this location. Figure 1. Counting ribs The lateral view is the better view for identification of the body of the sternum, manubrium, and vertebral bodies (Figure 2). Figure 2. Sternum and vertebrae in lateral chest x-ray 2 CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest \\nThe left heart border is formed by the aortic arch, the main pulmonary artery, the left atrial appendage, and the left ventricle (Figure 3). The right heart border is formed by the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right atrium. The descending aorta is seen posterior to the heart to the left side of the spine. The trachea is in the midline, but its distal portion deviates to the right because the aortic arch displaces it. The bifurcation of the trachea is called the carina. The right paratracheal stripe should be thin. If it is wide, it may indicate lymph node enlargement (lymphadenopathy). The right hemidiaphragm is usually higher than the left. The costophrenic angles should be sharp. Blunting can indicate a pleural effusion. On the lateral view (Figure 4), the trachea courses inferiorly and slightly posteriorly. The left main bronchus projects as a dark circle at the inferior aspect of the trachea. The left pulmonary artery arches over the left main bronchus. The aortic arch if higher than the left pulmonary artery. The posterior borders of the heart are formed by the left atrium (LA) and the left ventricle (LV). The right hemidiaphragm is usually higher than the left. Figure 3. Heart borders and major landmarks in AP chest x-ray Figure 4. Major landmarks in lateral chest x-ray CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest 3 \\nCT It is important to be familiar with the appearance of the chest on CT, which displays cross-sectional imaging anatomy (Figure 5). Some important anatomical relationships in the mediastinum include:        The trachea anterior to the esophagus (sometimes anterolateral and to the right)        The esophagus anterior to the descending aorta        The main pulmonary artery to the left of the aorta        The superior vena cava (SVC) to the right of the ascending aorta        The thymus anterior to the ascending aorta. CT can demonstrate cardiac structures (Figure 6). Figure 5. Axial CT at T4 vertebral level Figure 6. Axial CT through the heart at T8 vertebral level 4 CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest \\nThe serous pericardium (yellow arrow in Figure 7, left) is composed of two layers, the visceral and parietal pericardium. The two layers usually cannot be distinguished from each other when the pericardium is normal. When there is excess fluid in the pericardial space, or a pericardial effusion, the two layers of pericardium separate and can sometimes be distinguished (black arrows, Figure 7, right). Normal Normal Pericardial effusion Figure 7. Pericardium in axial CT CT can also show the relationships of the fissures and the lobes of the lung (Figure 8). The fissures are lined with two layers of visceral pleura. Figure 8. Fissures and lobes in \"lung window\" CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest 5 \\nULTRASOUND Ultrasound of the chest is performed for specific indications. Ultrasound (echocardiography) can be used to identify anatomical structures of the heart and to assess cardiac function. Ultrasound can also be used to identify pleural abnormalities such as effusion (fluid) or pneumothorax (air). Under normal conditions, ultrasound shows that the lung slides along the pleura. If the lung does not slide, that is an indication of pneumothorax. Bones can impede visualization of the intrathoracic structures. In particular, the ribs and sternum can block the sound waves and cause dark (echolucent) areas known as \"shadowing\" (Figure 9). Figure 9. Rib shadowing in ultrasound. The dark triangular areas (\"S\") are areas of shadowing. HEALTH DISPARITIES Physicians should be aware of disparities in the practice of medicine, with the goal of minimizing and eliminating such disparities. In thoracic radiology, studies have shown the existence of disparities with respect to race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and insurance status. A paper (Pezzin LE, Acad Emerg Med 2007; 14: 149-156) showed that in patients with chest pain in the Emergency Department, African Americans, females, and patients with \"other\" (non-commercial) insurance were less likely to undergo chest radiography (cis- or trans-gender identification of the patients was not examined in this study). 6 CPR-HFF-Syllabus-Basic Imaging of the Chest \\n \\n'"
